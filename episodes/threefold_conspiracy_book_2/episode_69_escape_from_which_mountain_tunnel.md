**[00:00:38 - 00:00:43]** But will this welcome wagon whisk our warriors out of this warped wonderland?

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:49]** Or are our would-be warlords wishful thinking leading them into a wickedly devised web of woe?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Hi, guys.

**[00:02:55 - 00:03:00]** I'm just covering the weather down here in Antarctica.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:06]** It's pretty cold outside, but, you know, the sun's out, so that's a plus.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** You seen any penguins?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** No, Penguins said it's too cold.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:24]** And we're going to turn finally to our sports consultant.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** What's the news in sports?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Mr. Billiam Jarrett.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:36]** The men's curling competition of note is finished and concluded.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** They all got drunk and decided not to play.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** That's it.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** That's the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** That's our show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** That's MSS 69.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** What's up, everybody?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** How we doing today?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** I'm asking you, the players, not the listeners.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** Super.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Thanks for asking.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Tone down that enthusiasm.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** We love our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:04]** We're all still recovering from that last fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** Even now, a week later, you're like, I'm really feeling it, man.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** It's really intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** I'm so sad that Rog is dead.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** That's my biggest thing right now.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Have you also woken up with chills about his death?

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** You're like, Rog!

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** I had a dream.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** It was a nightmare where we lived it over and over and over again.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** But I am glad that we're done with this freaking troll.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** That's true.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** I just hope we can get off this freaking station.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** I'm so ready.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** But before we get there, you know what's coming.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** We talked about it last time.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Two truths and a lie.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Real quick.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Who wants to be the person?

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** Last time it was Billy and Jarrett, a.k.a.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** William Garriott.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** That's one of his aliases.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** Who wants to go next?

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** One of many aliases.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:52]** One of many aliases that all rhyme with Billy and Jarrett.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** Cool.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** Any takers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Man, I had them like already last week.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** Really?

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** And now I'm like, I don't know.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I can't think of anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** All right.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** Well, you're going, Kev.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** Let's start with Kev.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** Oh, no.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Two truths and a lie.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** You spoke at first.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Let's see what you want to do.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** Give us your number one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** Man, I...

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** I got nothing creative going on here.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** That's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:24]** Your life is taking... I mean... Yeah, you've had a pretty crazy life.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** You have a lot of stuff to pull from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** I don't think Kev's been in the Navy.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** Yeah, that's for example.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** That's the first one.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** Okay, so two truths and one lie.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** So I'll start with the lie.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:52]** My first flight was actually on a helicopter.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** And then, let's see, what's a good truth?

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** I don't like ice cream.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:04]** Let's see, a lie now.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Oh wait, I already did my lie.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** Another truth, I've been to 15 countries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:41]** you pause before everyone so you're playing a little mind game with us so I don't know which one is the lie which one is the truth I truly don't I'm going with ice cream Kev seems like a Kev seems like a cake no ice cream kind of guy I mean if he doesn't like spicy food and then doesn't like ice cream that's pretty weird right I mean what are the chances yeah so I have to spot the lie yeah yeah I'm going with ice cream as well I think he's been to more than 15 countries I actually think it's the first one I think the first one's the lie

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** I'm actually going to go with you on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Is it my turn to say it?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Yeah.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** The lies of 15 countries.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** I think I've only been to like eight.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** I'd have to count them to be sure.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** Can you name all of them right now?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** Nah, I probably could.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** I'm not going to though.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** But I thought it was join the Navy, see the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Unless you're on a submarine, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** That wasn't my line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** You just got to see the inside of a nuclear reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** And fight the troll every day.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Is that the real troll killing?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** I'm sorry, Kevin.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** No, you're fine.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** My first flight actually was on a helicopter.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** I had a friend that was filming something in LA and won some aerial shots and he had an extra seat and was like, come join me.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:26]** And I was like, okay.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** My next flight was in the Navy.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** It was Tabooka.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** What was the other one?

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** No, I just don't like ice cream.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** I don't really like ice cream.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:37]** It's not my thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I've tried all the flavors.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** Is it just the texture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** All the flavors.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:50]** There are ice creams that I will eat, but if I was given a choice between ice cream and cake, I'd choose cake.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Yeah, between the two, I probably would as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** What about ice cream with cake?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** Ice cream cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** I'm not a fan of cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Gelato.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** So, I really like ice cream.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Ice cream is one of my favorites.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:10]** There's a spot in Portland that I went to once with a buddy of mine.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** I was traveling with a vocalist.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** And it's called Salt and Straw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** Salt and Straw is pretty good.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** It's great.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** There's one on Larchmont.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Yeah.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** What?

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** Another reason why you need to come out to Wool Save.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** LA has just everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** LA really does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** Salt and Straw is fantastic.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** They do really weird flavors, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** They have a balsamic strawberry.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** It was dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** I'll sample their ice cream, but then I'll go and order the milkshake instead.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** They do good milkshakes.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** I prefer milkshakes over ice cream.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:52]** I think my total country count was 10, if I just did that correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Kelly is now telling us all to live long and prosper.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:09]** I am telling you that I have this this little box and also have you do you guys know that there is this ice cream and just general dairy products made from various other creatures, including humans?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:14]** And so there are like stores where you can get like cat ice cream, human ice cream.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** I think about it like every mammal produces milk, more or less.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** So would you try cat ice cream?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** I feel like I would, just to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** I don't like foods.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:29]** I'm very picky with what foods I do like, but I will try almost anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Yeah, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:35]** Okay, let's get some cat ice cream then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** I don't know.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** I'm not a big goat milk.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:44]** It's all sort of dry, but in that nails on a chalkboard sort of way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:48]** I just don't like the goat smell of goat milk.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** What would a cat...

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** What would it be like?

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** I mean, would it taste like mice or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** I guess we'll have to try and find out.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** If anyone has any contacts, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** Claw your throat on the way down.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:07]** You just, like, cough it up, like, a little while later.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Great.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:13]** That's a really good sound to put in a podcast.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Well, thank you for playing.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** Yet again, stay tuned.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** for at least three more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Two truths and a lie.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:24]** Watch me and Kelly play Nose Goes next week.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** I don't want to do this game.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** I need to think ahead of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Write them down now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Write them down now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:34]** I feel bad because the ones I had last week in my head were so much better than today.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** I'm sorry for that.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** I should have stuck with those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** I think that's what everyone's walking away with.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:44]** Everyone's like, man, the ones that Kevin said were really good and he underperformed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:44 - 00:11:11]** i think that's what we're all he doesn't he doesn't do well on the spot yeah yeah he's not really an improv guy so it's funny that's the secret is that all of your lines for the show are actually scripted he just plans them every last every last one every reaction you're just reading off the script every every like every time before the game we're like charting out on like a whiteboard like okay if we say this then we just send ideas to you to like respond yeah yeah yeah give me options it's like a choose your own adventure it's great it

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** The end is nigh.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Let's retake that.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** The end is nigh.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:50]** As our four heroes, since we can probably call you that now, right?

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:55]** You've suffered blow after blow.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** Death...

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:23]** after death and you fought with blood, sweat, and slime inkies to defeat a horrible two-headed quantum troll and prevent a nuclear reactor from overloading and sanitizing the station.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:36]** Now, in the aftermath, you have confirmed last time after you not... It wasn't an easy fight to take care of that troll polyp, that trollop.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** But you've now confirmed that in this octagonal reactor space that you've been in,

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:50]** That the room was trapped with lasers in the ceiling that you might have set off.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Fortunately, you didn't.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** That just would have been an added complexity to the already difficult fight.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:04]** And then you've also given last rites to Frog, our beloved Akesti Rivener friend.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:30]** right as we were closing you sent a communique and received one back from shay and shay had said let's get out of here and that's where we'll pick up because he says what what is the status of your reactor

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:33]** We're good to go from our side.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** The reactor is fine.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** It is cooling down to be non-operational.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** Look, we asked you before.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** The first thing I asked you was, are you alive?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** And that's because I'm glad to hear that you're alive.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** But you said that you lost another member.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:49]** It sounds like it's just the two of you.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:55]** Like I said, from our end, some people got sick from radiation and...

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:00]** There was some surprise trap devices, so we're also hurting pretty bad.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:08]** I mean, look, it's important right now that all of us, including you, get a chance to relax and recover.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:13]** I'm just about to head out, be on my way to your blast doors.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:19]** I can meet up, I can shake your hands, and I can thank you for helping to save everyone here.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** because I don't know that we would have gotten off this place without your help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Well, we're not off it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** And to be clear... So look, if you want...

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:39]** If it's roughly the same, there should be an area where you can control the doors into a hangar space.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** And there are some blast doors beyond that.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** We can meet up there.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:50]** You can open the doors and you can get out and I can meet you there and I can help escort you to the ship.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** It's not too far of a walk.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** It's pretty short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Okay.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** And Rick turns off the radio and he turns to the other guys and is like, I'm not certain that I fully trust this Shay person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** I don't blame you.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:12]** I'm not one to cast aspersions, but it was a little fishy to me too.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** But we should try to get out of here regardless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** Let's just tread carefully because we don't know another way out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:26]** Was he suggesting that we return to the other area where we thought there was an exit?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Or do we need to go through this door here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** I don't know.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:35]** I thought that they were going to direct us to an area that we haven't been in yet in this area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:42]** So where he was talking about was where you all found the photo.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:48]** Like the room that you came, that you went from to go down the tube, that room.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** If you remember, there was a set of doors to the north that were like larger doors.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:59]** And what he was basically saying was if you go through there, there's a like hangar space in there and there's another door there and I'll meet you at that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** Even if we don't trust him, anywhere's got to be better than here.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:14]** Do we want to go through our little mezzanine hatch that we found, or do we want to actually go to the thing?

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** You mean that vent that you and I went into?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Did we take the lasers down?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Is that what you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** I guess we didn't take the lasers down.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** No, we didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** No, we were able to get through there.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** We got to the ladder well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:32]** Yeah, we were able to get through there, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Can we climb up the ladders?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** I thought they stopped at like 10 feet above the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** Two of them are all the way down, and the other two are broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:47]** My last question for this room was, that door leading towards the reactor, is there any indication on it?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Is there any reason we should go in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:55]** If you want, that's where the actual... As you would know, that's where the magic happens.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:14]** in terms of the reactor so if you want to troll is kept uh inside the nuclear reactor yep that's where the troll is uh he actually got out on the big troll wheel that yeah it's like a it's like a big wheel that's yeah uh kevin's curious rick's not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** We're talking about the area.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** I think we should head back up.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** Dr. Will, were you talking about the area?

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Dr. Will?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Dr. Will.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** I'm not a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** That's my father.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** No, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** I'm Mr. Will to you.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** Mr. Will.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** I'm Will Jr.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:42]** Are you talking about, you're not talking about that little like vent shaft, that little like crawl space?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** I think he is.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:47]** Yeah, he was saying that that thing was to get to his side of the reactor or whatever.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Why don't we do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:56]** Yeah, because if he's trying to set a trap for us at the exit, then that would get us all around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** Maybe we could just tell him that our door was jammed.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Wait, don't tell us to the GM.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** The GM's listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Oh, yeah, we shouldn't tell the GM.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** Let's communicate privately in Slack about our plans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:11]** But also, you know, Doc, I think that's a swell idea.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Shall we?

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** What do you say, the two of you?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Colin, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** I am not opposed to this plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** You haven't seen it yet, Colin, but it's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I'm going where you guys are going.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** All right.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** I will follow.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** He looks sad.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** All right, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Cool.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Didn't John make like a little area for that?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** So, okay.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** So you guys head back up.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** Screwing up John's plans.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:44]** He's like, that makes me think that I have some full control.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** That's the secret to being a GM is you just assume that you never have full control.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** You just plan for everything.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** That's it.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** Let's just dig a tunnel of our own.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** Guys, I'm just going to sit down and I'm going to go to sleep.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** That's it.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** That's what you do.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** I'm done.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Give me one sec.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:06]** So you guys head up back to you.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Go back up the ladders.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** Come back out in the garden.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Right?

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** You walk around.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:21]** It's been less than 24 hours, so I think you're fine to, you know, walk through without any worry about what might happen.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** And you come back around and maybe you do get a bit of nostalgia.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Right?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:35]** As Colin, you are thinking, you know, this is where I was paralyzed.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** This is where they found me.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Right?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** You think...

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:51]** That as you're walking through, you're like, this is where you see the dead Shirin body that was part of the swarm, but also technically enhanced, biologically enhanced.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:56]** You go back through the room where you met Frog.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:01]** These are all memorable places of the past eight hours, maybe.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Eight hours?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** Maybe four.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** I can't recall if you guys took a rest down here.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** We took a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** You took a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** Okay, so honestly, maybe the past two to three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Like earlier today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Yeah, earlier today.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** And, I mean, for you, the time is all messed up.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** You've been going, taking rests, going.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** There's really no way.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:29]** There's no way to gain a sense of any sort of circadian rhythm or whatever the equivalent of that is in the Starfleet universe.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** You head back up, back into the room that led down to this reactor sector.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Start going up the ladder.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:41]** I'm going to need to have all of you make climb checks to make sure that you don't fall.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** What's that, a dex check?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Athletics or acrobatics?

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Yeah, I think it's athletics or acrobatics.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** It's only DC5 in order to get it.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** Well, then I automatically pass.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** Eight will do it.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** That'll do it.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Ooh, 22.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** Oh, it's athletics, not acrobatics.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** It's athletics.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Athletics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** I automatically pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** Okay.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** If it's only at five.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Okay.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Go on, pass.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Okay.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** So everyone's fine.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** You're going up.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** And you do come across the same little hatch.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** Again, it's very narrow.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** It's only five feet high.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** What is the order in which you want to go into the hatch?

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Rick will go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Rick will go first.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Colin will go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Then Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Piers will go after that, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Piers, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** Do we let Shay know that we're coming through that?

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:37]** Because it's going to trip the laser sensor unless we disabled it, which I don't think we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I don't remember.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** Can we look to see in our notes?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** John, do you remember?

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Did we disarm the laser?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** I know we tripped it.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** You tripped it.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** I don't think you disabled it.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:51]** Also, technically, you didn't respond back to Shay, but I'm just going to assume that you were like, great, we'll meet you there.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Or what did you say?

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Yeah, something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** We'll try to head our way over there, Shay.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** All right.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** We'll see you soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Looking forward to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Shay's a gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** I'm going to... And then... I'm going to be upset.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** Do you want to... Let me bring you guys over to the map so you can see where you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Yes, please.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** All right.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Ah, there's lasers.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:20]** So, okay, if we trigger these, they'll know that something is coming because it's just a notification laser, right?

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** That's what I was thinking, yeah.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** We could tell them that it... Is this weaponized?

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:30]** Do we remember if there's some kind of reaction they could set off or some bomb they could set off to defend themselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:34]** Well, from what I'm reading in our notes, it says actually that Dr. O.K.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** put a trap there.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:59]** ah here's goes deeper into the tunnel that rick goes down the ladder that's right can we not yes i'll have to disable that trip i can here's at the end of the other end of the tunnel sees another ladder that might go down to where stewart's went and then that's when you guys turn back and and join rick okay um so can't we just i don't think lasers would be engaged


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Why not?

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:04]** There was a warning ping that the stewards got when we passed them.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Is that what happened?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Yeah, it's just a sensor.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** Okay.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** We couldn't shut it down last time, right?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** Because we had to be on the other side for some reason to shut it down?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Yeah.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** You would have to actually go touch them to shut them down.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:42]** yeah rick will see that and he'll he'll turn back and say like these lasers are still intact should we just trigger them and move out the way that we were told to supposed to i like that idea oh uh any objections trigger the lasers and go down the ladder the ladder on the other way that we were going to go that's what i mean yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:47]** No, like sugar these and then go the way that we were told to go.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Why can we do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** Because then he has false signal that we're coming the other way.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** Ah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** Look at John the GM nodding his head like he understands.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Shh, stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** I'm also a player, guys.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:05]** Hey, it's just me, your friendly player who's never played in the game before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** I think that's pretty smart.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** Should we maybe divide and conquer?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Wait, what do you mean?

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** Split the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** I don't know.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** Two of us go this way and two go the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:23]** Not advisable in my opinion, but I like where you're going with it, but we've tried this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:31]** I like where your head's at, but I don't know if that's going to be a good situation for two of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:53]** well that we do technically like i think uh colin and rick can now hold their own in a physical fight so like it would be if we were gonna split i would suggest we split you know like one caster caster with one of us and then you know doctor okay with the other we do know the best practices of this though and it is it flies right in the face of it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** I am completely opposed to splitting the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:05]** If we all want to just die and call this quits, we could split the party and see how it goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** If you guys have already worked out a plan in which you're like, you know what?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** Let's just wrap up this whole show.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** We're going to die.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** And that's going to be it.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:21]** Leroy Jenkins!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Rick, Rick, no.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** Rick, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Screw you, Rick.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Yes.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:32]** Do we agree to that plan or do we have some other idea?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:38]** I think triggering it and then going back the official way is a good idea altogether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** So Rick kind of like puts his hand out and pauses for a second for anybody to stop him.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** And then he's going to trigger the alarm.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** So you walk up.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** I mean, nothing happens.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** You move your hand in front of the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** You wait for a second in front of the lasers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Yep.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:58]** And then, yeah, I mean, there's nothing that happens there locally, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** These lasers seem to go down the entire hallway.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:06]** And so I think we should leave something to make them look interrupted for at least a while.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Bernice.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:33]** oh bernice yes i'm kidding i'm kidding no no thank you john that's a great idea no it's not dude murder box come on lose bernice i mean she's integral to the party stay right here for like a while and then come back like that's the command you can tell her yeah stay here for 10 minutes and then follow up she's pathfinding to you from like a random location is that possible

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** She knows this way down.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Yeah.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** She's been this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** Her token was already here before, so she's been in this tunnel before.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Yeah, she's been in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Yeah.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** I mean, I was joking.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** We came into the ship and she was born in it.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:52]** I could have Chad do it because Chad is technically less useful.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Is Chad incorporeal?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Yeah, Chad would trigger that.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** He would not trigger it then.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** He could hold something, though.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** Didn't I set a trap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:10]** Could we modify that trap to then just flutter the sensor and give it a false positive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Sure.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** I'd say just make probably an engineering check to see if you can rig it up.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** I shall assist.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:22]** Because I thought you said another sensor to detect if anybody else was coming down.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** I don't recall, but... Pretty sure that's what you did.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:32]** So just to jerry-rig it, to actually put out something other than, you know, to put out something that the lasers would, that it would trip.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Okay.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** So what am I rolling for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Or can I do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** I think you can.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** I'm going to say you can, but you just need to make an engineering check.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** And I'm going to say DC 20.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** So it's like not easy, but also not crazy hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** Okay, so I got, and here's his assisting.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** What did you get?

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Because I could roll separately if it's too low.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** Sure.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:05]** I got a 20 off my engineering, so I got a... Perfect.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** No, wait, sorry.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** 11 plus 8 is 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** You got a 19.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** I assist.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** for 21.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Okay.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Yeah.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** It takes a little bit.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:26]** You try a couple of times because you're, you're basically trying to put an output that would like interrupt the laser beam and you finally are able to find a setting after maybe five or 10 minutes.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** And then you, and it's like shooting.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:41]** I imagine that it's shooting out something that is like kind of intermittent, like it's on and then it's off and it's on or it's like, you know, to make it look like something is, you know, moving past it over and over.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Yeah.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** And then, then, uh, yeah, that's it.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Then you said it, you should be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** All right.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Good call here.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** All right, cool.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Let's get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Yeah.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Let's get back to work.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** All right.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:59]** So you crouch, kind of get down a little low.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:03]** The track lighting moves back ahead of you as you head back out the ladder.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:12]** And you are able to come back up to the section where you were before.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** And I need to grab Colin.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Apologies, Colin.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:24]** This is your first time, maybe in your memory, that you've been in this space, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Yeah.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Colin's basically never seen any of this before.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Yeah.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** How does that go?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:33]** He's probably slightly dizzy just from all the sensory input.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Colin, check out this dead gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Let me just point out dead gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, there's that dead gray.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** This is where you fought those Skrillings, Paul.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Peter, remember?

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:57]** You come into this control center, central area, and the door to the north, the double door that...

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:24]** originally had a red emergency triangle sign on it that that sign is no longer there and instead you're seeing a blue standard light that seems to be operating normally and you recall dr okay through bernice that when bernice was hooked into the computers bernice was able to there was a control in that computer to open up that door so you could very easily stop

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** And open the door if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** I'll do that.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Pause.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Hold.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Hold.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Here's what Rick says.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Okay.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** What's up?

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** Just let me know when you want me to open this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:40]** I don't suggest splitting the party, but we know that there are two doors that lead to this same room.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:44]** Now might be the time to at least split up and enter the room from two different angles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** We would have to go past that monster, though.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** There was another monster, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** That worm.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Oh, the worm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** I forgot about the worm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** Which has a cool name that I haven't told you yet because you haven't identified it.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** There's a worm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** I can live without that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** It might be worth engaging.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Really?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** I mean, but... Maybe we can utilize it.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:10]** Are we going to be that technically disadvantaged or are we going to be that advantaged beyond this door?

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** I think we're getting into a fight.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** I don't know, man.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** I'm nervous.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** We're going to probably get guaranteed get injured and weakened a bit by going that route.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** It's a chance that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** I think the difference might be between one and two fights in that case.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, I prefer the one fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** Or you just want to kill something else, huh?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Same.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** You just want to murder more creatures, huh?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Another notch in your belt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** You want to get that kill count up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** I completely forgot about the worm thing.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:51]** So, yeah, Vinny, there was a sandworm skeleton thing that spit acid at us or something?

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:54]** Is that what Rick says to Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Shy Haluda's on the boat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** Massive dune worm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:26]** okay so what do you want to do this is good stay in here behind this yeah rick rick will move up and get an angle okay on the door he's gonna roll stealth to hide behind this thing so that he could join later if necessary and um it's a 20 okay gonna roll stealth get a 20 okay so when you roll stealth in your your hiding you get a bonus on your tax or something right look


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:50]** oh yeah we talked about what that meant because otherwise mechanically there wasn't a way and i think it's a really or there wasn't a clear way if there's any rules loving people out there who wanna we've gone over this we have i'm just saying i know i'm saying don't forget to use that yeah that's what we decided but i'm sure somebody's out there is like well actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** We should add that to the rules thing.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Yeah, we should.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yeah, please.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Okay.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:02]** If you successfully, if you are successfully hiding from a creature, that creature is considered flat footed for the purposes of your first attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:02]** Yes.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Love it.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Please add.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Thank you.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Colin doesn't know what to expect.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** So he's taking cover sort of in like the alcove coming out from the lateral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Okay.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Yeah.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Makes sense.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** I like it.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Hears is hiding behind the console.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** Dr. OK has stood behind a console on the west wall.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** Bernice is hardwired in.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Or maybe just Bluetoothed in?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** I'll have to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** And Rick?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:36]** I'd say she's interfacing with one of the desktop towers off to the side.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** She's cozied up next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** She accidentally presses the CD drive slot and it comes out.

**[00:33:44 - 00:34:12]** hits her in the face rick's like oh what's the cup holder for yeah and rick is uh cowering behind another uh right uh console what's colin doing so i'm not playing elijah elijah anymore that's true true okay so you tell bernice to hit it and i'll tell you guys what you see

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:28]** You're greeted by a large hall made of hewn stone that is 40 feet wide, 30 feet high, and there are beveled corners.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:39]** The stone surfaces are gouged into long, even rows that seem to be some sort of way to mark distance there.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** And there's a massive double door 20 feet high.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:49]** both in height and width, that takes up the eastern wall.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** It is most of the eastern wall.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:58]** There's the airlock door that you came in to the south and then one further to the east on the same southern wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** This room greeted us.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Hello.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Let me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Inside me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Polygon reveal.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Sounds kind of gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:13]** It honestly looks also like there are scuffs on the floor.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:20]** And you think this is probably where larger vehicles have come through.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:26]** The airlock door, the massive one to the right, is closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:38]** okay so vehicles for getting stuff on and off the ship and it's actually written like lit with some red lights and stuff so they're not in here this is the place where they wanted us to meet them though right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:39 - 00:36:08]** so basically they said go like there's gonna be another room probably past that control area there's another door we'll meet you at that other door basically was what they said that other door being the red doors right yeah and they're just red because they're like this is meant to be like a you're about to enter another sector another area it's a clear threshold from where you are now going somewhere else can i roll a sense motive on my memory of that conversation

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:14]** Yeah, but I will say that you don't have a perfect memory unless maybe Rick recites it perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:18]** I don't remember what I said, but I can try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Give me a sense motive.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:24]** That's what sucks is Rick has an amazing memory, but Kevin doesn't.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Fair.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** 28.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:28]** 28?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** I have plus 10 to sense motive, and I rolled an 18 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Nice.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** Nicely done.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Okay.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** You can recall that his tone seemed sincere.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:50]** He seemed like he was genuinely interested in trying to meet you, and you didn't get the sense that there was a trap.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:54]** You did get the sense that he is maybe...

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:00]** Not holding something back, but he's a professional, so he is as earnest as he can be about wanting to see you.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** He's not going to come out and be like, so here's everything we found and where all the stuff.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** He's a steward.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:11]** He's not going to break stuff or break protocol, but he genuinely wants to meet you, it seems like.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:22]** Can I roll engineering or perception again on these tracks to see if I know what made the tracks?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** Like if there were stewards vehicles versus something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Like a survival check maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Oh yeah.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Survivals for trackings.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Survivals for tracking vehicles?

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** I guess so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** It would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** It's just any tracks, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Any type of spore or sign.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Sure.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** Okay.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** So you want me to roll survivals?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** I'm a fan.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** All right.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Do it.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** My survival is a plus six.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** I rolled a two.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** So eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Do you mind if I take a shot?

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** What is this for?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:56]** Colin's survival is plus 10.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:02]** So that's a one on the die.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** I mean, it's a critical failure, but it's also an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** There's no critical failures for skills checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Oh, wait.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** No, it wasn't one.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** I just accidentally messed it over to a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** Yeah, it seems like there might be some vehicles.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** You can't really identify them.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** You're not really sure maybe what gray vehicles would be.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:25]** There are definitely some marks that are probably from loading and unloading.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** Carts, hover, trolleys, things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** Good general cargo bay wear and tear.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Yeah.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:43]** All right, well, let's get out of... There's nothing in here, so I think we should press forward and try to find our friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Rick will cautiously walk up and pass through the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** We should probably generally perceive things, right?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** Because that will determine if there's traps or something.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Can we look for a trap?

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Sure, yeah, of course.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:58]** I only rolled a 10, so if anyone else wants to roll perception... I'll roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** I rolled a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** You got a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** I got a 16 on that.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** 16 on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** The air feels really cold.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** 22.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** It feels fresh.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** You got 22, Dr. OK, even.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** You don't sense any traps.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:28]** It looks very similar, though, to a lot of the stone and architecture that you've seen where these rooms have been very well integrated into this space.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:35]** They are very well built in, and it's clearly a utilitarian design kind of for everything.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:41]** And the ceiling itself has some lights that are hanging from it.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** They seem to be normal.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** The walls truly don't seem to have any secret panels or anything in them.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** It's around that time that it was Rick who was communicating.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:54]** Rick, you get a ping from Shay.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Do you answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Shay, this is Rick.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** Hey, just wanted to check in.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** We got kind of a ping down from that access tunnel that we were talking about earlier.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Was that you guys, or is there something that we need to be worried about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Yeah, we're going up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:36]** where we're going through that way oh we just decided it would be faster okay uh yeah that's fine just be careful i mean it sounds like you guys made it through but we had a lot of issues with a lot of strange beings that these graves were working on here so if you go through there just be careful because we try to get some of them but like i said we uh yeah we we took some losses

**[00:40:36 - 00:41:01]** so just be very careful uh we will come meet you at that one that's the one that we actually came out of so i'll go meet you there that sounds good we'll see you soon okay all right why didn't we just tell him that we were because i would have defeated the whole point of like yeah i'm with you on how and kelly and you think you had to do that really well wait what did you say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:28]** think you did well that was good i wouldn't have thought to say that but um but did they just say i'm sorry did they just say they were going to go to the other something instead of the whatever whatever the exit is on that side i'm assuming they're both outside like if this is our sorry what were you gonna say uh colin colin he had something to say i've got a good uh good feeling about these folks i'm not sure why we're trying to mislead them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** Yeah, I think we should just say, hey, we're going through the cargo bay.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** We're already here, actually.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:41]** We were just going to collect our stuff that we left to keep, you know, in case something happened to Shay.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** We wanted also to be alerted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:51]** After everything that has happened to us over the last week, I don't trust anyone anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:51 - 00:42:02]** Colin, you weren't here for this, but a place that we were before, we would try to sense various things about some parties that we would interact with.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:11]** But it turns out that they were kind of controlled in a way the whole time, or at least something weird was going on.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** So it's hard to trust anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Sounds like quite a few weird things are going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** You know what I mean?

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Yeah.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** I don't even know how much I trust you.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** JK, you've got a room in yourself, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** For now.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** For now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** So we did the perception check on this room, right?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** So I'm... Sorry, I'm burping.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Excuse me, I burped.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** And then I'm going to head in towards the large doors.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** We're sure these are not airlock doors, right?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** They're not going into space.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** No, there should be airlocks.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:44]** The doors behind us have to close before the other doors open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** Does that mean I get sucked into space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:51]** Yeah, like, yeah, I was going to say we should all hit our... Environmental protections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Like, vaccines.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** That would be one problem solved, but there might be other problems that would come up, right?

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** I don't know.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Zero gravity, maybe?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** We're going to end up in the middle of space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Kind of worried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Yeah, well... Can we send Bernice to check it out?

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** Maybe open the doors for us?

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:11]** Not that I want to sacrifice Bernice, but I feel like with how old she is, she could probably just, like, jetpack herself back in or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** She doesn't have a jetpack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** I don't know.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Bernice has everything.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Who knows what she has?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** She does not have everything.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:22]** Bernice has been able to do... She's a complete other party member that you 100% control.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Yeah.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** I gotta say.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Very fair.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** I concur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** Let me look up what jump jets do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** But that doesn't mean that you should sacrifice.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** I'm not sacrificing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:35]** I feel like... It's a little heavy of a word there, Kelly.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Harsh talk, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Harsh talk, man.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Can we remotely open this from inside this room?

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** These doors?

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:47]** can you remotely open those doors from the other space that you're in from these consoles in here that I'm in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:52]** I mean, I think that would be not a problem for, for the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:57]** Rick and Colin are in the big, like airlock tire mark doors and Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** Bernice and here's are in the room before.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:04]** So like effectively Kelly just asked if he can jettison Rick and Colin into space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Now, hold on.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Everybody come back.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Let's, let's be safe about this and open.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I'll say this right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** You can tell that on the other side of this airlock door, there does appear to be an atmosphere.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Oh, okay.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Because it's a space that you're able to move through.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Wait, on the other side of the big double doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** The big double doors, yeah.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:29]** Okay, he's going to enter the room, go towards the door, and Bernice is going to...

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** Like, you know, slide up to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Okay.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Are there any portholes or windows on this thing?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** No.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** There's Mara.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Watch over us.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Yeah.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:45]** Rick is going to clip on a carabiner to that crazy cable that we found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** And hand it off to Colin.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:53]** But I think the four of us should like... Red Rover, Red Rover.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Yeah, create a chain on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Just in case.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Let's do it.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** I'll hook up to that.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** Call him a clippant.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Good idea.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:06]** He's also going to put his hand on the door to feel like temperature, vibration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Use the back of your hand.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Is the back of your hand more sensitive?

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** No, it's to protect yourself so you don't burn the palm of your hand.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** It was a joke.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Yeah, you touch it.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** It feels about the same temperature.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** Again, this room seems like it's been mostly untouched.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** So the air feels cold.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** The metal also feels cold.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** That's about it.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:35]** You don't feel any vibrations because there seems to be nothing on the other side.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** From you just touching the door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** I say we proceed.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Let's go.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Let's do it.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** I'm ready.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Okay.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Rick will step forward and push the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** Boop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** And everything explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** That's the end of book two.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Just kidding.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** End of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** End of the game.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** TPK.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Too easy, guys.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Come on.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Roll higher on your perception.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Okay.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:01]** So you start to...

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Open the door.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:06]** And the door seems to open pretty easily.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:15]** It takes a second because all the power kind of has to... And as it opens, maybe some dust falls.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** It seems like it hasn't been used in a bit.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** It's not ancient, but it just hasn't been opened in a little while.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:28]** And you see before you a stone, the same stone floor that you're on now.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:36]** starts to gently slope up and it's more of this high walls that are, you know, 40 feet, 30 feet high.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:44]** And it seems like the, the walkway slopes up and then turns to the left.

**[00:46:46 - 00:47:15]** and it seems like more of the same it seems like it's a it's a wherever it turns to this is probably a ramp that uh ships and stuff had to come down so i think we're going to proceed cautiously is this okay hull and the room that we're in currently like is this in the same design language as the rest of the ship yeah it is so the fact that it's stone makes me think that this is like this we know we're in a lab and not a ship we were on a ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** I think we're on like an asteroid that is being propelled.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:28]** We're at least on some kind of rock building or, you know, this is like a stone building turned into a base proposed, like, and it probably has some sort of propulsion system.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:34]** Otherwise it wouldn't have been able to evade, uh, the authorities for so long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Oh, good.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Are you showing us the room?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** I was just going to reveal a little bit of it that you can see.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** This music is not very good.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** The stone is darker, but it seems to go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** What was that, Kelly?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** I was just going to say, this isn't very confidence-inspiring music.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:56]** It's a little foreboding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:00]** It's like you're playing a video game and your HP bar jumps up.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** Aw, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** There's a save point right outside the door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** There's a campfire.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Yeah.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Yeah.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** It's like in Borderlands when I have all the vending machines.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Yeah.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Okay.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:21]** So you all come and start to walk up.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:25]** And it's a little probably unusual.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** It sounds like you're still paranoid.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:32]** You set a trap to trigger their other sensors so you could convince them that they were going somewhere else.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Rightly so.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** You're really worried.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** And as Rick said, you can't really trust anybody.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:48]** Those are skills that you've been developing that they've served you well so far.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** So, you know, you might as well trust them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** We're only on the second fold of the threefold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Technically, you might still be in the first because it's six books.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:28]** So as this music can tell you with that nice major note there, you start to walk up and as you turn the corner, you see about 50 feet in front of you what appears to be, it opens into a larger space and you can't see too much except it looks like maybe some lights of a hangar and there seems to be some light coming in from the side.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** And as you walk up,

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:37]** You see that the passageway opens up into a landing bay.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** I'm going to bring you guys to the page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Whoa.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Yeah, it does look like we're in an asteroid field.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** Good call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:47]** Before you is a sleek, dark warship.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:57]** Its coloration indicates that it's probably used for clandestine activities as there is a steward symbol on the side, but the whole ship is grayed out.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:05]** And you would recall that steward vessels, at least their fleet, tend to be pretty iconic of the blue and gold of the stewards.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** There's a sleek metal gangway ramp.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:16]** that stands open in the mid-forward section of the ship.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:20]** And you all are waiting there for a minute.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:25]** And then it's actually, you hear footsteps coming down.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** Doom, doom, doom.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** And you see a half-elf.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:35]** And you recognize her as the face of Narla, Yalamis.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** And she looks at you and says...

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:45]** Hey, I thought Shay was going to come get you, but welcome aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** This is our ship.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** And again, I apologize if there was a miscommunication.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** We wanted to escort you.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** We want you to be safe.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** But it's great to meet you.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:02]** She walks up and she walks over to Dr. O'Kay and to Rick and to Hears.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Pleasure.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** She goes to shake your hand and then she says...

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** I don't think I know you.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:13]** You with the Saren Ray symbol on your chest.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:19]** I'm Narla Yalamis, one of the Steward's Special Ops agents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** Pleasure to meet you.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** I'm Colin Eaton-Brandt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** Colin Edenbrand, it's a pleasure to meet you.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:31]** And she pulls out her communicator and says, Hey, Shay, so they actually came out of the other door.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:37]** So if you want to come back and we can finally get out of here like we've been needing to do.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:42]** And looks over and says, Can I, uh, are you guys feeling okay?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** You must be pretty, I don't know, hurt or perhaps you might be feeling- Where are we?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Oh, great question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:58]** I'll explain more once we get inside, but right now, you're in the Forgrim system.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:07]** I don't know how much experience you've had there, and you do look outside, and it does look to be a massive asteroid field.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** And there's some sort of star in the distance.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:20]** And there just seemed to be some rough planetoid off in the center or some corona that the light from the star is showing.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:27]** And she says, Forgrim's system is pretty far out in near space.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** The nearest drift beacon is not nearby.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:36]** So it's honestly quite surprising that you're out this far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** Do you know why you're here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** No idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** We were all aboard the Chimera.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** The Chimera.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Not quite.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** We were in right somewhere.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Correction.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Three out of the four of us were on the Chimera.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Oh.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** Which left Liberty Station about a week ago.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Liberty State.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:03]** Okay, I might have to have you tell me that again, but we're obviously in the midst of preparing to leave.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** Our people have already come aboard.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Some are okay and some are not.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:12]** I think you've had a similar experience with these f***ing greys.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** I just... This is a dangerous place.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:20]** And at that time, from another opening on the other side...

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Is you all hear.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** Footsteps of.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Sounds like two other people.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** And.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** As they kind of walk.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Under and around the ship.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** You see that one of them.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Is a shorter.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Balding.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** Stout.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:40]** Muscular.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** Dressed in dark military armor.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Again balding slightly.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** But a trim black beard.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** And also a heavily armored vest.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** They walk up.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Hey, sorry about that.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** Maybe something got miscommunicated there.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** I thought you were going to come at the other one.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** I'm glad you're safe.

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** I'm Shay.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Shay walks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Shay, I am sorry for the confusion.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** We started to go down that way and decided to come back this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Yeah, he told us about the monsters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** We were like, nah, nah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** You know, it's probably wise.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** I mean, again, I don't know how many of them we didn't get to because we're trying to get out of here.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** Oh, this is fire spitter, by the way.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Fire spitter is kind of pleasure to meet you.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:28]** Fire spitter is tall, heavily armored, stoic, very militaristic sense about her.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:34]** Doesn't say anything, just kind of nods and then looks over at the out at the asteroid field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** I'm sorry to hear about your losses.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** I'm really sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:44]** Yeah, I mean, you'll get to meet the crew, and, well, I wish you could have met some of them.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** It's honestly a bit of a travesty.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:52]** This whole mission has been rough on all of us, suffice to say.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** But we can tell you more.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Gnarla, should we get out of here?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Are you all ready to leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:01]** Are we the only group of survivors you found?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** Yeah, we didn't find anybody else.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** I mean, we found some of the creatures that were hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:11]** Are there any other Osharus that you've encountered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Osharus.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** I didn't see any other Osharus.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** There is something, though.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Let's get on board, because I might have something to show you.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** Actually, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:28]** Wait, why did you ask that, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** Because Dr. Bishdakis, I was pursuing him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** But not on the chimera, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:37]** No, but he might have been brought up with the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** I don't know.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** All right.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** That's a good question.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:47]** Some of the greys had some of the artifacts from my dealings on my home world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:52]** And so... Isn't that Pabak?

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** That's your home world, right?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yes.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** Gnarla kind of looks at Shay being like, you should know this, you're a steward.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Sorry for him.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Go ahead, Dr. Rokatas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:12]** Yeah, just that when one of the grays, they were experimenting on us and tricking us into believing we were on another ship.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:23]** They came up with some of our, some of my trade goods with my doctor friend, Bushdogus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:28]** This is... This also just sounds like the Greys.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** This seems like something that they would do.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** And I'll be honest, this is not our first time encountering them.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:43]** And they are everything that you have heard from the rumors and the conspiracies that you might hear.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** They are that and more.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** So I...

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:53]** I'm glad that you're here and that you're alive, and I'm sorry that we don't have more information about your friend here.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** Rick, Mr. 19 in the back, you're raising your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:27]** actually i was gonna say like this is on the side like um rick is gonna kind of look at here's like wide-eyed like he's trying to get his attention and he's gonna kind of just rub his helmet a little bit because he's trying to tell here's to do like a telepathic link yeah got it here's here's telepathically like links and it's like what's up do not let them know anything about those stones that you have oh i wouldn't keep those about gus yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** Those are too valuable for me, too.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** I'm not going to do that.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Good call.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** I'm on the same page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:38]** And he nods, and then he looks back at Narlan and is like, no, I'm sorry.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** I just had an itch on my helmet.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Ha, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:48]** Mr. 19, you said all that out aloud, so I heard everything that you just said.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** Just kidding.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** At least nothing came across their face, so I don't think they heard you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Does anybody... Do Lashuntas have any kind of... Yeah.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** I'm not going to play into that.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Do they have like telepathy or anything?

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:09]** I thought that was what the antenna are for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:14]** It depends on if they're Tamiya or if they're... It's the other name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** I always forget it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:38]** anyway right because like some are like more uh focused on like martial prowess and the others are more focused on like spells and magic and stuff like that here's make sure to tell to trend to say to dr okay telepathically you know we're gonna yeah we gotta keep uh those things on the download those blue glowy things all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Don't let him know.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** No problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** All right.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** You're like telepathic.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** I tell everybody.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Yeah.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** Including the fire spitter in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Wrong channel.

**[00:58:50 - 00:59:10]** my bad hey sorry okay so rules lowered me um lachentas can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speaking well share language


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Yeah.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:13]** I don't know if that means that they would hear you.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:14]** Is it the same?

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:20]** Because I feel like there is a sense of intended target, like a radio frequency, right?

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** But I truly don't know.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** And I would rather look to the lore when it comes to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** Radio frequency is not, like, directed.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** No, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** You can definitely intercept.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Maybe band limited is kind of what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** It's not really a frequency necessarily, though.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Like, how would we define it?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Now we're getting into the...

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** Now we're getting into the nitty gritty of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** I'm looking up telepathy undershirts too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:46]** Yeah, because I do want to know if they would hear that or not.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** Or whether you would think that.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Well, okay, so here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** They have limited telepathy as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** So it's the same.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:06]** It says it is possible to address multiple creatures at one telepathically, although just as Kevin said, so that implies that you have to actually actively try to address them.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** So I think we're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:16]** Yeah, they might have heard a whisper, but unless they were actively listening, and if he was trying to whisper it telepathically.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:23]** So you all, Shay says, hey, I really want to check on everybody.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** I want you guys to be able to get some rest in your cabins.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:28]** Can we get on board?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:56]** let's get out of here fire spitter walks up and uh narla says let's head to the bridge you can get a lay of the land there meet some of the senior crew and then we can get out of here make our way out of the forward rim system and she starts to walk in she turns around and do you all board the ship shay's gonna walk behind you

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Quick point of clarification.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** You mentioned that this ship in particular was grayed out.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:10]** And that it is not typically a subtle color for... Yeah, it's like a spec ops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** And that's because it's clandestine?

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Is that why?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** Or used for clandestine activities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Clandestine?

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Clandestine, yeah.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:24]** So the thing is that you would know that the stewards really have three branches, right?

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:37]** there are the typical stewards agents who you can think of as, uh, sorry, mall cops, mall, less mall cops and more like private cops.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** Like they can be on any planet kind of at any time.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:45]** And they are typically on certain planets to keep the peace.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:53]** The director Pinkerton's like Pinkerton's like the head of the stewards is an advisor for the pact council.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:57]** but it's not on the pact council, but that's how much power they have.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Yeah.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:04]** In a sense, but less shady because the thing is that they are also officially recognized as like pack worlds police.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:12]** The thing is, is that, so there's the general agent, uh, that that's called the constabulary, right?

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:19]** Then there's the overwatch, which is the starship fleet for the stewards.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** I like this line.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:26]** The sheer amount of space within the packed world requires a substantial force to patrol and monitor.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:30]** So the stewards enjoy greater freedom to act in outer space.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** This is where you would think of a typical colors of a stewardship.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:38]** The third group, though, is the ops, which are kind of loose.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** And I liken them a little bit to in Star Trek Discovery.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:47]** What's that new what's the new group that they've been talking about?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** It's like the like secret group.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** No one else?

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** Okay.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** I'll think about it.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** It's fine.

**[01:02:53 - 01:03:01]** They operate within kind of a loose organization, and their hierarchy is less tied to the Constabulary and to Overwatch.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:07]** And so you would think that this would typically be an Overwatch ship, but again, it's purposed for ops purposes.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** That's why it still has a steward symbol on it, but it's grayed out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** Cool.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:17]** Yeah, call the boards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:22]** Yeah, you guys start boarding and... Rick will put his gun away and follow everybody else up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Okay.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:28]** Yeah, and as you get on, you hear kind of Shay in the back be like...

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Let's just get the f*** out of here.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Let's go.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:31]** Start walking.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:41]** You're surprised because even though the outside is all blacked out, grayed out, you're struck how inside it's still colorful.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:47]** Still seems like it is probably, you know, part of the Overwatch fleet.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:53]** It still has a lot of the design inside, although probably presumably some of the systems are not.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** It's a highly operational intelligence machine.

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:01]** Some of the off-white metal floors are trimmed by gold lines.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** The lighting is soft and diffuse.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** It comes kind of seemingly from the floor and the ceiling.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** You can't quite localize where it comes from.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:12]** There's concern for mental health and consideration.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:20]** There's a lot here that indicates a very high level of design and organization to make this come to life.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:26]** You're taken through the front engine room and then into a lounge area where there is a lift that's waiting.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]** You rise up to the bridge.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]** It's a small room, maybe 30 by 20.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:40]** As you're walking, Gnarla turns around to whoever's first or just to the group and says...

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:45]** Have any of you ever been to the Foergrim system before?

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]** Can I do a culture check on... Is it Foergrim?

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** What are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** Foergrim, yeah.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** F-O-E-R-G-R-I-M.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Culture check?

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:59]** Make your culture check.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** 27...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** Got a 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** 28.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** I'm not going to beat that, even if I rolled 20.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** 27, 28.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:24]** Dr. K, you remember that the foreground system is, I mean, really a kind of... It's pretty much like a very loose collection of asteroids, planetoids...

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:43]** there is only real one planet and it's a dwarf planet and it's also located around other smaller planetoid that's probably that corona that you saw because the thing is that you remember stopgap has a lot of is or at least was very rich in star metal

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:45]** And so a lot of corporations have made a permanent home there.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** Love me some kiss.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:48]** Yeah.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:54]** And they... Sorry.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** It's okay.

**[01:05:55 - 01:06:01]** The foreground is like just barely near space, although it is very far out.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** Like the nearest drift beacon is pretty far.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** You would remember that, again, there's a lot of asteroids.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** There's like millions of asteroids here.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:10]** There's one planet around this yellow star.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:14]** So occasionally you'll get a lot of like prospectors.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:17]** There's a loose form of government on that planet stopgap.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:18]** It's like the gold rush.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** Out in the middle of nowhere.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:28]** Well, that's kind of my question is, so we left Liberty Station and was in the packed worlds, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** That was in near space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** Okay, so we are no longer in near space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** Well, the Fargrim system is in near space.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** Oh, okay.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** But it's really far out.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Yeah, just barely.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** So you all head up.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** I need a map to see it.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:50]** Maybe you start... I imagine this comes out as like, Dr. Okay, you're talking and Gnarla's kind of feeling you.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** And she's like, yeah, you know.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:54]** And as you get up to the bridge...

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:05]** She is saying, we'll get more into it once we're able to get to our base and we can debrief and everything.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:10]** But there is a lot in the Ferrogram system that is to be investigated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:20]** So you walk into the bridge and... I'm assuming Gnarla's in front of us, like leading us to wherever.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:38]** Yeah, so you took that lift up from the lounge area, and you're in a room that is maybe 30 by 20, filled like any standard bridge would be, except the floor is light blue, brown walls, orange readouts on the blue screens.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:43]** It seems like the actual tech here is definitely fitted for an ops ship.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]** Gnarlet takes a seat off to the right.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** Shay kind of walks behind you.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** You all walk in, sit in the middle.

**[01:07:51 - 01:08:03]** Gnarla turns around and says, I don't think I've said this yet, but welcome to, as we've found out, what's called Outpost Omicron, as we've discovered its name.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** That's this station.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:07]** Now let's leave this godforsaken hellhole.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** Sorry, god's forsaken hellhole.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Are we all ready to leave?

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Do anything else?

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:21]** She's looking at you, and then she looks at the crew, and they...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:26]** Do we want to leave explosives to burn this place alive or what?

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** Shay.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:30]** That's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:31]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:39]** When she turns to address the crew, I want to see if I can notice a scar on the nape of her neck.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Okay.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** Give me your perception check.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** Six.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Doesn't seem to be one.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:54]** You do see the symbol of Waden that's on one side of her neck, but you don't see any scar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]** Wait, Vinny, what are you getting at?

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Do you know...

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:02]** What kind of... She's human?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:08]** No, just like having seen the cortex bomb in another being.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:14]** I'm looking to see if there's evidence of this not being what it seems.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** It doesn't seem like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:17]** Alright.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** I'm going to roll perception just on the ship itself.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:25]** You said that the interior is different, but I just want to do a double check.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** Like...

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:36]** Rick's a little in awe because he's never been on a stewardship, and he idolizes the stewards, but at the same time, he is completely paranoid that everything is not what it seems.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:39]** Totally.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]** I rolled an 11 with 6 for 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** Okay.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:45]** Yeah, you are...

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:53]** It does seem like it is, again, more... The bridge seems like it's more technical than you would think from the rest of the ship.

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:56]** So, obviously, other spaces here have been outfitted.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:58]** Everything seems pretty normal.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:02]** Shay and Narla are not the only people aboard.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:05]** There are... Or on the bridge, there are maybe three other people there.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** And...

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:10]** Otherwise, everything seems pretty normal.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:19]** I think probably the most interesting thing is that the number of readouts and information that they're having displayed around them is pretty impressive.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:26]** There seems to be like they are taking in a lot of information at once and their systems are quite capable.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:26]** That's what it seems like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:31]** Okay, carry on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:33]** Shay says, let's go.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:35]** You feel the ship.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:38]** Let's blow this popsicle stand up.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:53]** As the ship begins to lift and start to head out, Gnarla says, Hey, so just... I don't know why Gnarla's talking like Shay.

**[01:10:54 - 01:11:05]** Our home base and closest space that we can get access to is our base on Varos, the second largest moon around Bretheda.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:08]** So, that is our destination.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:21]** Once we land, we might ask you a few questions because this is a pretty unique situation that you have found yourselves in and we were not expecting to find you.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:29]** Now the experience that you've had is unsettling, but that information could be extremely helpful.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:33]** So obviously relax on the ship.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:38]** We'll be at Veros for a few questions and then we can drop you somewhere if that's more convenient.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** But that is our plan.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** The ship is starting to back out.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:46]** What are you all thinking?

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:48]** Because you're actually on a ship.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:49]** What do you think?

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]** You're actually in space backing out of this port.

**[01:11:54 - 01:12:05]** And as you back out, you do see that it looks like this station and these entrances are built into a very large asteroid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:10]** Do we see the Chimera ship as we're pulling out by any chance?


## Speaker_0

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:22]** Maybe as you're pulling out slowly, you can maybe start to make out another entrance, or it seems like there's probably... This isn't the only landing bay for Outpost Omicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:29]** Yeah, can we ask Narla if they, like, did a survey of this asteroid, and can we, like, take a look at it or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:32]** We did do... Can you just whip it around so we can get a view of the backside?

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:33]** Beep!

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:33]** Beep!

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** Just as a backup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** Uh...

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:40]** Yes, we did do quite an extensive survey of the station.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:42]** So yes, that's not a problem.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:47]** I think given your experience, we can absolutely share that with you.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** Super.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** So how is everyone feeling?

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:52]** That was just kind of what I wanted to ask.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Or if there's nothing to say, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:55 - 01:13:19]** i'm rick is still completely unsettled yeah dr k is still unsettled and uh all the more curious to uh get to the bottom of what was afoot that led him into this hellhole of experimentation and demonic influence rick yanks out his battle axe he's like tell me everything you know right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:48]** here's uh yeah here's his feels pretty much the same and then just keeps thinking about that blue glow and rolling and thinking now he has to keep that a secret oh yeah maybe in your hand you're like fumbling with the stone especially since rick said that to you you know you're kind of like turning it over in your hand in your pocket yeah this is this is gonna be interesting because colin doesn't know about the stone that's true well colin doesn't need to know did you direct it to colin i did not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:50]** Oh, interesting.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** Cullen's in the dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:53]** Cullen's an outsider still.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** Cullen's an outsider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:57]** Yeah, it doesn't make sense for me to trust him.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** It's true.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:58]** Yeah.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:16]** I mean, in three hours, he's gone from, you know, serving communities in Akaton to waking up in a bush, almost dying, leading a giant on a wilderness hike, killing a two-headed troll and its polyp.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:21]** and boarding yet another foreign spacecraft.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:23]** That's true.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:28]** He's probably done some irreparable mental damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** Yeah, that's a possibility.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:35]** That's a definite possibility.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:35]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:40]** I think at this point, he's ready to see how far down the rabbit hole this goes.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** What else could possibly happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:42]** What?

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** You're wrong.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:49]** What other folds of this conspiracy are there yet to unfold?

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** Find out next time.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:50]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:53]** I've made a graphic of you all on the bridge.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:54]** It's amazing.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** It's very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** It's quite amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:56 - 01:15:01]** Some of your characters are in very aggressive positions, but that's just a photo that you wanted of them.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:04]** Like Rick pointing his gun angrily, Colin about to stab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:06]** Yours looks great, by the way.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:06]** Thank you.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:17]** Like I've Rick looks like he's from like that like reboot television show that like really Almost like he was custom-made just for this one image.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** It's great.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:25]** They almost rebooted reboot like and then didn't I like that show they would've just been ironic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:33]** So you all start to Start to pull out and

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:35]** Wow.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** Because it's episode 69.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:41]** We avoided making that joke all the way up until right now.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:43]** We didn't do it.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** Good for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:46]** Honestly, good for us.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:52]** No!

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:57]** 14 from Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** 14 from Rick.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:01]** 8 from Colin.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** 8 from Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:03]** What are we perceiving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Got to roll high enough to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:09]** Wow.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** Are we looking out the window?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:12]** You're looking at the main viewer screen.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:13]** Eight.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:14]** 28.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** 17.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:16]** Love it.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:17]** 17.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** I'm sorry.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:19]** Dr.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:24]** O.K., you notice Shay, one of his fingers, pushes a little button.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:26]** And then...

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:38]** Rick and Hears and Dr. K, you notice faintly, it seems like on one side of the asteroid, you're pretty far away now.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:44]** On one side, you do see what appears to be a flash of yellow, like some sort of explosion.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** Oh, nice.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Hey, Shay.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** Is that what I thought that was?

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:53]** Shay turns and there's a slight smile on his face.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** But Rick...

**[01:16:56 - 01:17:02]** Your comms device buzzes like you just got a notification for a message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:14]** Rick will kind of make his way, like just step away from everybody else and pipe it in to just his own comm and hit the button.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:21]** I'm going to put it in your journal and I'm going to let you decide if you want to read it or not.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]** I just saved changes.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:27]** It should be in your journal.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:29]** If it's not, I can message it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:31]** Is it just Rick19?

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** It just says Rick19.

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:37]** So this is for the reader.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:39]** Everybody else take your headphones off.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:39]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:41]** I'm not kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** Can I leave them on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:45]** Alright, they're off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:48]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:50]** Before we do this, is there a signal to put your headphones back on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:52]** I'll wave at you.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:52]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:17:53 - 01:18:02]** So the message that Rick got says, new target acquired, Leovara, Roselight, more to follow.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:09]** My question to John is, is that a full name or is that a location?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:13]** Leo, you know, Leovara is a sister planet to Brethina.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** Roselight is, it's like capital.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:17]** Is the target.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:18]** Got it.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:20]** Capital city.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** I'm waving at everybody else to put their headphones back on.


## Speaker_0

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** Headphones back on.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** What was that all about?

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:28]** I went away for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:29]** Well, you wouldn't see it.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:33]** Rick kind of just leaned over and hit his watch, essentially, and listened to it in his ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:34]** Dr.

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:37]** O.K., you asked Shay... What did you ask him?

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:39]** Is that what I thought that was?

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** He turns around.

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:42]** There's a slight smile on his face.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:50]** And he goes, Dr. Cottis, that thing that I told you about...

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** Pabak, right?

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:56]** That's where Jehavum is, right?

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:58]** That city?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:59]** Yeah, capital city.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:00]** It's where I'm from, man.

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:01]** Yeah, that's right.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:05]** Before I forget, I found this snippet of a file.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:06]** I don't know what it means.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:09]** Maybe you want to just have it.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:10]** You can read it.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:11]** You can tell me more about it later.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:12]** Take a look.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:16]** He does a little thing that sends the message to you.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:17]** He airdrops it.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:19]** It looks like it's a

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:45]** picture on a data pad of some text and i'm gonna put it in your journal and it's up to you if you want to read to everybody what it says what is going on let me put it in will g do you get it it just says dr okay it's airdropped though so rick picks it up too whoa i don't say anything

**[01:19:45 - 01:20:11]** do you want to take off do you want to tell the readers the listeners what you saw or do you not want to say anything I say nothing you say nothing okay okay alright but we all heard that happen yeah but he's kind of talking like hey doctor okay look this made me think of you you know cause of Javon yeah he clearly wasn't talking to y'all

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:19]** Now, all of you at this point have seen another yellow explosion on the asteroid.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:21]** Shay turns back around.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:27]** What's weird, though, is that there's another one closer, right in center view.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** But it's green.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:31]** The explosion is green.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:35]** Colin.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:36]** The reactor.


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:36]** The reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:40]** Colin, your comms device... Can I, like, perceive?

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:42]** In just a second.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:45]** Colin, your comms device also buzzes.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:47]** And you have a notification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:50]** You get a secret message, so you can read it.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:51]** You can read it if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** It's the same deal.

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:55]** I'm going to put it in your... I learn things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:56]** I know how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:57 - 01:21:00]** I'm going to put it in your... There we go.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** It should be there.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:03]** Just says comms.

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:03]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** Colin's reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:13]** Oh, my God.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** Okay, so you get three options.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** You don't tell anybody.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:21]** You tell just the listeners or you can tell all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:24]** I'm holding on to this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:25]** You're not going to say anything.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:27]** Oh, my God.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:27]** You guys are so mean.

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:31]** Dr. K, give me a mysticism or physical science check.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:35]** Okay.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:38]** Physical science, 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:41]** 25, crushed it.

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:57]** In your head, the green seems like it is part of the reactor, but the way it's moving, you think that maybe there was something going on in one of the rooms you didn't go in, or there's something going on here where it's not just the nuclear energy.

**[01:21:58 - 01:22:00]** There's also this quantum...

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:27]** energy that somehow the troll got infused with and it seems like that the whatever explosions were there have hit that area and now the explosions have this quantum nuclear energy in them kelly rather here's you get a notification on your data pad oh okay it seems like it's some sort of audio message and you could probably put it up to your ear and listen

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:29]** You got three options.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:33]** Do you just want to hear it and I'll cut it and I'll read it to you?

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:38]** Do you want everyone to hear or do you want, sorry, do you want the listeners to hear or do you want all of us to hear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:42]** But why do I have to choose before receiving it unlike everyone else?

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:44]** Oh, because it's audio.

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:46]** It is actually audio.

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:47]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:58]** To be fair, I'm willing to tell you guys if you're willing to do cognitive dissonance on it and make sure your characters don't understand there's nothing going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:00]** All right.

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:01]** Let's let the listener hear this.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:04]** Let's let the listeners hear this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:07]** Okay, you take off your headphones.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:14]** It seems like it was buried in your data path.

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:30]** comes up you put it up to your ear you're watching these explosions but maybe you kind of turn away because the voice that you hear is familiar you hear started the audio

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:36]** Sir, you are not going to believe my luck.

**[01:23:36 - 01:23:47]** I might have just discovered something that would be of immense use to you if... You're not getting my messages, sir.

**[01:23:47 - 01:23:49]** I don't know where this is going.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:53]** This is going to be my last message to you.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:58]** It's been too long and I don't know where you are or if...

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:06]** Well, if this finds its way to you, sir, if you hear this, then you know where to meet me.

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:11]** And it ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:11]** All right.

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:13]** Cool.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:14]** So that was rolling.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:15]** Yeah.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:16]** Yeah, nice.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:17]** I love it.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:19]** Seems like it was a message from... Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:20]** Oh, man, I wish I could read lips.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:26]** So John read something off, I'm assuming, because I saw John talking and waving his hands.

**[01:24:26 - 01:24:27]** It looked...

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:27]** Intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:34]** I can't believe we have to listen to this episode to know what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:38]** At this point, maybe all of you are suddenly in your own world as these thoughts are happening.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:45]** But on the view screen, the cluster of green explosions, these little dots kind of pop.

**[01:24:46 - 01:25:02]** and I'm making sounds that you wouldn't hear, they coalesce as part of the asteroid begins to silently detonate with this green explosion, painting the entire bridge in this synthetic, eerie green hue.

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:13]** Then it's followed by another second, equally massive green explosion that rips the other half of the asteroid apart into two massive green halves.

**[01:25:13 - 01:25:21]** Then the explosion slows down and all of you feel time slow down as everything around you comes to a crawl.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:30]** You are flooded with a memory of Frog's body in that first room as his body's flying towards Rick when you first meet him.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:34]** You recall the discovery of the stewards and the hope that it brought.

**[01:25:34 - 01:25:37]** You recall the olfactory nose with bittersweet memories.

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:44]** You recall meeting Colin, finding another possible survivor here.

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:46]** All of these strange circumstances.

**[01:25:47 - 01:25:51]** And a tingling begins at the base of your spine and moves up to your head.

**[01:25:52 - 01:25:54]** And you are all level five.

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:57]** Yes.

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:58]** You hear a voice.

**[01:25:59 - 01:26:00]** It's Gnarla's.

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:01]** She's looking at you.

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:04]** Hey, hey, are you okay?

**[01:26:04 - 01:26:06]** You're just standing there.

**[01:26:06 - 01:26:08]** Are you... What's going on?

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:14]** When someone else's voice says, What's happening out there?

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:15]** What's happening?

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:17]** And points to the view screen.

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:23]** As you realize, it wasn't just your perception that was slowing down.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:28]** The green explosions are beginning to move slower.

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:36]** They're beginning to actually come to a halt and freeze in space.

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:40]** And then they begin to reverse.

**[01:26:40 - 01:26:41]** Reverse.

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:55]** as if being sucked back into the asteroid as the rock begins to fold in on itself, moving in these hyper shapes before it just blinks out of existence.

**[01:26:56 - 01:27:05]** No debris, no residue, no hint that this asteroid ever existed, just darkness and silence aboard the void crier.

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:09]** And Gnarla's voice says, well, that's that.

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:15]** End of book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:16]** Oh, what?

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:18]** Very nice.

**[01:27:18 - 01:27:19]** What an ending.

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:25]** At least we're out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:25 - 01:27:28]** Wild, wild stuff.

**[01:27:28 - 01:27:29]** Wild stuff.

**[01:27:30 - 01:27:32]** What could happen next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:32 - 01:27:34]** Hostile takeover of the Void Crier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:36 - 01:27:44]** I just want to be around some people that are not out to get us or not fake people in some way or have things in their heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:45]** Maybe nice.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:46]** I hope this is them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:27:46 - 01:27:52]** I really want to know if the rest of the asteroids folded back in on themselves.

**[01:27:52 - 01:27:54]** It sounded like they've interacted with the greys a whole lot.

**[01:27:55 - 01:27:57]** Is this normal or is this just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:57 - 01:27:59]** It just seemed like that asteroid did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:59 - 01:28:01]** It's just cutting-edge gray technology.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:05]** It's probably fail-safe for their gray base so that nobody captures it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:28:07 - 01:28:16]** Yeah, book three, weird stuff starts happening around the void crier, and then we jettison from it, and then book four is us backing the same.

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:18]** I wouldn't do it.

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:18]** Oh, my God.

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:19]** Shut down the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:28:22 - 01:28:22]** Oh.

**[01:28:22 - 01:28:25]** Three-fold conspiracy book for Groundhog Day.

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:28:28 - 01:28:29]** Groundhog Day.

**[01:28:29 - 01:28:30]** Book six is identical to that one.

**[01:28:30 - 01:28:32]** We'll just be trying to say frog the entire time.

**[01:28:33 - 01:28:33]** This time will be different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:28:35 - 01:28:36]** Not the bolita!

**[01:28:38 - 01:28:42]** I think the listeners need to give them crap all over Discord.

**[01:28:42 - 01:28:42]** What was it?

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:43]** Tell us everything.

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:44]** We need to know.

**[01:28:44 - 01:28:47]** It's not fair to keep it to yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:51]** We should all reveal it at the appropriate time, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:28:51 - 01:28:53]** I'm properly shook by mine.

**[01:28:54 - 01:29:02]** But it's one of those, once we get a bit more context for Colin's backstory, I'll probably drop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:02 - 01:29:07]** Mine feels so boring in context from all this intrigue.

**[01:29:07 - 01:29:14]** I think last thing to leave on, next week we're going to probably release Plot Armor 2.0.

**[01:29:14 - 01:29:17]** And then after that, we're jumping into...

**[01:29:17 - 01:29:19]** a short session of junkers delight.

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:20]** Yeah.

**[01:29:20 - 01:29:21]** I will be running.

**[01:29:21 - 01:29:22]** So stick around for that.

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:24]** And then we're going to roll right back into this.

**[01:29:25 - 01:29:27]** And book three is going to come on hard.

**[01:29:27 - 01:29:27]** I'm sure.

**[01:29:28 - 01:29:28]** Yes.

**[01:29:28 - 01:29:29]** Thank you.

**[01:29:29 - 01:29:30]** Thank you everyone for listening.

**[01:29:30 - 01:29:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:31]** It's been a blast.

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:33]** Thanks for sticking with us through book two.

**[01:29:35 - 01:29:37]** More of you have been joining us as book two has been going on.

**[01:29:37 - 01:29:38]** It's been awesome.

**[01:29:38 - 01:29:40]** So it's been a fun adventure.

**[01:29:42 - 01:29:43]** And a bit of a.
