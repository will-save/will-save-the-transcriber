## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:17]** Previously on We'll Save... Our entourage encounters and parlays with Rog and Akeshti Rivner, who before falling victim to his grey tormentors, was a prolific pugilist on Akaton, competing in the highest echelons of gladiatorial combat.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:29]** Krog warns the party of a terrifying two-headed troll trampling through the area and agrees to help our heroes end another evil in the form of an insectoid foe lurking in the chamber next door.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:47]** With their new Akeshti ally in tow, the crew agrees to breach the room together from all sides, but before the signal to breach can beckon, our brave battlers witness their Akeshti accomplice burst through the door like a frenzied pitcher of fruity sugar water.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:53]** Has our company of cowards finally turned crusader thanks to their new Keshti ally?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:57]** Or are these onlookers about to feel the wrath of a rage-filled Rivener?

**[00:00:58 - 00:01:01]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:57]** All right, I have a contentious topic to talk about right here at the top of the hour.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:06]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast, where you're hearing awesome stories about why you hate traffic.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:11]** Tell me your worst traffic story, and I'm going to call somebody out first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** That is Mr. Gilliam.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Is it me?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Oh man, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** What if it was just a bad traffic day?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** Not necessarily a bad traffic event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:29]** It could have been a bad traffic day, but I mean... Well, I live in a city called City of the Angels, or La Ciudad de Los Angeles.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** I think is the right way of putting it.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** I live in Los Angeles, and there's a lot of f***ing traffic.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:39]** And today, I'm two hours... Well, an hour and a half late to recording for this reason.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** It took about three hours to move, I don't know, 30 miles?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** Yeah.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** It's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Not even 30 miles.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** You were driving from what, like Reseda?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Yeah.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** That's like, what, 15, 20 miles?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** I guess you're in London.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Yeah, 30 miles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Yeah, it was the worst.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** But yeah, I don't know.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:59]** I heard that LA has the worst traffic in the world, although some people have contended it's Toronto, but maybe listeners can chime in.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Yeah, Toronto?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** I've never seen Toronto on the BuzzFeed list.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** I've heard all kinds of things about Mexico City.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** I've heard things about... Just Google it.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** Tokyo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Yeah, Tokyo.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Yeah.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** What?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** You said something and it got swallowed because we all talked over you.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** I did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** I don't remember saying anything.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** It got swallowed.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** I was Googling worst traffic in the world.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Top 10 cities according to usnews.com.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** usnews.com.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Coming in hot off the press.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** What's number one?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Oh, it's one of those like click through.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** I'm never going to make it to like the... Oh, 10.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Number 10.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I'm not going to do the full countdown.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** Oh, man.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Give us 10, 5, 1.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** Dublin Island is number seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Okay.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Really?

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Mexico City is six.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Paris is four.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** Rome.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Rio de Janeiro.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]** Number one is... America's not even on the top ten.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** I don't believe that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Classic us thinking that we were somewhere in the top ten.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** To be fair, traffic in other countries is crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** That's true.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** That's true.

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:01]** I was going to say, driving in Mexico City one time, I was not prepared when I was in Mexico.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** And basically...

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:12]** Traffic lights are optional and you honk to alert people around you that you are driving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:36]** yeah it's like and you drive that's how you i mean because i've i've been to like you know korea and um japan and guatemala and yeah it's there's a lot of cars in america but you know we have we have a few questions question i i would i would proffer a bet or offer a bet that uh

**[00:04:37 - 00:05:06]** vietnam probably has the worst traffic for motorcyclists oh oh yeah i mean because there's but they just have like millions of motorcycles yeah lauren lauren was in vietnam for a project and uh she yeah she talked about the traffic for a while but oh i think we've already talked about this but i have a i have i watch high speed chases and now just our fans know that i'm now in maryland um and we're still in la he misses la but

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** I miss it.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Huge infrastructure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** He doesn't miss the food.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** He doesn't miss the weather.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** He doesn't miss anything other than car chases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** The people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** And I don't have to miss the car chases because they show up on my phone.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** He has an alert for car chases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** I follow like Fox.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:50]** fox 11 la and it and they have uh anyways the chase popped up and i texted the group and was like john this chase is like right in your neighborhood and sure enough it was an rv like went up the street that is below john's apartment and i was like i was like john literally as soon as i i sent him a screenshot because it's his text being like hey john you should go look out your window and then i get a notification from citizen being like hey you should stay inside miles away

**[00:05:50 - 00:06:19]** an rv was running away from the police if somebody yeah amazing i don't i'm not saying he got away but the camera flew away he must have not well no they parked the rvd like randy went to a building but like i'm sure they tracked it down they'll get them later uh anyways um or maybe what i was gonna say though is back to like the traffic topic is i think i mentioned this before it's just interesting that like some of the things that like criminals will do anything and everything to get away right they will they'll go on the wrong side of the road they'll you know

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:48]** run through red lights speed all that stuff but they will always almost always get back in a lane and i think i think will was like oh it's because of like oil slicks and stuff which is crap because no criminals aren't thinking about that oil slick inside of the road you know in the middle of the i don't know you would know unless you've been a criminal yourself kev but you're talking about i think you talked about how like motorcycles you know you drive in the tracks of other cars that you're not yeah or it's more worn a bit yeah

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:59]** But I do think it's just ingrained in American culture that you have to be in a lane enough that even the criminals that are actively breaking laws don't think about getting out of the lane.

**[00:06:59 - 00:06:59]** I think so.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** Watch it from now on whenever you see a chase.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:06]** Anyways, back to the actual traffic conversations.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:13]** I have been stuck in traffic to the point where I've been stopped for...

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:32]** five hours was it actually took 11 that's a long way that was from New Hampshire to New Jersey and back wow I mean I got stuck stuck on the grapevine one time on a five for like a few hours but that was classic yeah

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** But yeah, I was going to say that too.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:38]** Like I don't, I remember as a kid, whenever there was like a bad accident or something, like everybody would stop.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:44]** And there, there were times where we'd have like a road trip and we'd have like licorice and we would go share licorice, which you wouldn't do now.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:47]** Cause like, you know, COVID germs and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** Wait, what?

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Like, nevermind.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** I don't know.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** I just like the image that Kevin is presenting these days.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Wait, what licorice are we talking about?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Black or red, first of all?

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Yeah, this is key.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Red vines.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Are you red vines, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** A big jar of red vines.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Okay, all right, good.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** I was just making sure you weren't a total dad yet.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** I'm talking like the one that you have to hold in your arm.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** It's good.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Okay, I didn't know that was what you were talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** And when everybody's stuck in traffic, you get out, you have lawn chairs, you sit and make friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** What freeway are you on, bro?

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** What friendly freeway is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** This is like the 15 freeway or something.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** This is when I was a kid.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** 15 freeways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Okay.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** Did you charge people like a quarter for the rest of it?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Yeah, did you sell like lemonade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** No, because we were all in it together.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** It was like a community.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** Everyone's like, we're all in it together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** And now everyone's like, I will kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** Less than it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:55]** If you don't let me in this lane... Wait, we were in traffic just yesterday, and this car was, like, right on this other car's a**, because there was, like, a 20-foot gap between them and the next car, even though all traffic was stopped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** That's silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** You don't need to... Like, why are you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** That's silly.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** I do get very frustrated.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** There was one time coming back from Vegas, which is, of course, notoriously bad.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:10]** And we're in like, not stop, but stop and go just slow, you know, 15, 20.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:19]** And somebody just comes speeding on the side, you know, shoulder, just trying to go as far as they did it.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:44]** this i don't think this this was you but the first person went by and i was like i hate them so then the next time i saw him in my mirror i pulled over and i blocked him and they just like they literally pulled off the shoulder into the desert and around me after about 10 minutes of just being on my butt the whole time john that's how you get shot man yeah don't do that dude don't be a hero don't don't give in to rape don't be a hero i just i just hated it it was just so annoying

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** And then a trucker pulled over and actually blocked him.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** So it was fine.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:48]** It wasn't just me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** I've actually never done that.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:56]** Just for the record, I've never illegally operated any motor vehicle.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Especially very specific.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Definitely not.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Especially not a motorcycle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Definitely not.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** Good to know, man.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** No one will look you up.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:14]** We got a red light cam ticket for $75 just today.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** And we got to... My wife and I got to do the debate of like...

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Who was driving?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Oh, they don't show you a picture?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Where was it?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** They showed the picture, but it's like, what street was this and what time of day was it?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Who was it?

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** We determined it was Lauren coming home from work because she works at two different locations.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was her.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** So I handed her the ticket and was like, well, that's yours then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** Yeah, because it's not like you guys share a bank account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Yeah, we don't.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Is that weird?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** No, that's not weird.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** We can discuss that.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** We have our own finances.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:54]** We are open and transparent, but we don't share a bank account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** We should have a whole intro just about...

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Personal finance.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Personal finance.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** That'll be super exciting.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Stick around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Come back next week.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** This is the outro for this episode.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** It's just this clip where we just talk about personal finance.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** And it's a whole other episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** I'm speaking to an accountant next week.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** This is all that I've learned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** And we're going to have a couple callers.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** It's like a secret episode.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** The episode length is two hours and 30 minutes.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** It's tax season.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Be prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** It's tax season.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** Well, with that being said, with that great segue of tax, you guys want to play some Starfinder?


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Talk about taxes now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** No.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:40]** I want to talk about the IRS and how taxation is the ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** I don't know if we should keep that at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** No, let's get into this.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** It'll be bleeped.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** Taxation is bleeped.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** All right.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Let's actually play.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:56]** Will, give me that sweet, sweet drop of your voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:19]** previously on will save oh so good was that a drop i didn't see his mouth that was a drop whoa i love that we're getting so high tech on this show i love it i know we really are nice intro music ominous i like it under normal circumstances


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:33]** You all would be safely exploring this hive of technical labs with ease, resting, laughing, making s'mores above a chemical fire.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:41]** But this is no ordinary technical lab, and you have not had a normal experience.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** After boarding what you thought was a ship,

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:53]** to Absalom Station from Legacy Station you discover these clues to strange missing persons case aboard.

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:04]** Eventually cascading to a hostile takeover and then a total ship destruction as you flee in the skatepods.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** If you don't remember that part go back to episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** I was going to say this is like a long previously this is like throw all the way back to the beginning.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Are we recounting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** I've worked it.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** I got it.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** I got


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:22]** So you find yourself in these labs and begin to, again, discover more clues about your whereabouts.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** Again, under normal circumstances, you might know, but this time you don't.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:33]** So you're in a lab belonging, as you find out, to a previously unconfirmed person.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:51]** species only known as the greys you only talked about them on random strange conspiracy podcasts or strange government releases after 20 years you know this this group i'm gonna bleep that out this group that lurks

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** It's a little late, sorry.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** They're talking about aliens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** It's perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** It's actually one of the best episodes.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** In the shadows.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Okay.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Maybe I will go listen to it for inspiration.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:08]** They kidnap, they probe, choosing curiosity or maybe some call apathy over morals.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:19]** until you find out that the stewards, the chief police force of the Pact Worlds, has been bombarding this place and asking for surrender.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:36]** Come to find out there's a stewards team that has already been here, but now needs your help for both of you, your group and their group, to unlock the blast doors that separate you from freedom,

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:47]** Problem is, you need to shut down a reactor that's about to explode, and there might or might not be several ghastly creatures in your way.

**[00:14:49 - 00:15:01]** So you wind your way through, find your way down to the reactor sector, and you manage to calm and befriend some sort of test subject, a large red akesti named Hrog.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** And Hrog...

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:18]** Says, I fought this troll and I lost, but I will help you fight this troll if you help me destroy what's left of my fellow pained test subjects.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** A swarm creature that's been modified.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** So you agree?

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Yeah.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:39]** And as you are about to open the door, Frog jumps ahead, rips open the door, showing you this purple and pinkish swarm creature standing motionless in the test lab.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:44]** There are cybernetics modded into its body, all glowing green and vibrant.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** And in the dark, dim light...

**[00:15:47 - 00:16:01]** you can see that the green light is showing that its hands have been turned into some sort of weapons, and it slowly turns its head and looks at Frog, as Frog is like, Let's f***ing kill them!

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** And you all need to roll for initiative.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** My, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:17]** I just want to point out that I, or repeat, I'm really proud that we were able to talk Harag down and turn him to our side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** That was awesome.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** That was a fight all on its own.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I'm so excited to help Harag.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:33]** free these people of their misery, free these creatures, and also just help him realize his dreams, whatever they are, and maybe help us and stay with us forever as friends, which may probably not happen.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** I hope so.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** Let's make him be ours forever.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** He's just going to wear a hood everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:41]** Kev, did you see that I changed the intro pitch?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** It's really nice, yeah.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Thank you.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** I did change it.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** You just deleted the character.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** I did just take out the character.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Kelly didn't get to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** I briefly saw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** John always has the landing page.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** It's more for the listener.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** It's also for Kelly.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** John always has a landing page that he updates.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** He's starting to throw more and more animation to it and get really good at it.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:12]** This time, he put in a picture of Harag throwing a boulder at the creature that we're going to fight right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:36]** and this is the creature i'm gonna interrupt you like frog oh god it's another dude it's so badass like a freaking a swarm inspired gundam i'm i'm not i already saw it's a pretty good way of putting it don't be a pooper it looks like a gundam it's got like awesome uh yeah it's like it's like an armored i don't know insectoid with like plasma coming off of them i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:44]** It's got like a razor blade arm that turns into like a double-bladed sword, but it's like an organic sword.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** It's creepy.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** It's gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:49]** One of his hands is like a... I don't even know what it is.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** A darksaber?

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:57]** Yeah, so there's like a darksaber one, but there's another one that's like two blades into one, and in the middle there's some electrical current in the middle.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** Yeah, like a fork with some electricity inside.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** It's awesome.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** I don't like it.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** It's not going to be fun.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** I mean, he looks squishy to me, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** So John had that on the landing page.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** And it was cool because it was like the rock thrown at it and then it jumps on the screen.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** It was really cool.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** But I was like, John, you can't do that until after we see these things.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** You're right.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** You're right.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** I'm just going to talk about it, how we already saw it every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:22]** Well, I explained it last episode, and I thought it might be nice to show you.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** But you're right, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** I'm a visual learner.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** All your words mean nothing to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I thought so.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** I truly thought so.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** I truly knew it from the beginning.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** And let's go around the horn with the initiative order here.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Let's start with not Rick.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Uh, here's what you get.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** I got a 17.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Here's did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Yeah.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Coming in hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** Show off.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Yeah.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Where are you in the thing?

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Well, we'll go over in a sec.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Dr. K, what'd you get?

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** I got a 19.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Oh, come on.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Wow.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** I just won up here.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Rick 19.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** All right, that's it.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** You got a 19 too?

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** We're going to start.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** I only have a plus one initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** All right, guys, relax.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** It's not that great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** What's your dex modifiers, Dr. K and Rick 19?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** I just said...

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** I just said it.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Plus one, because we were talking over you.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Plus one dex.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Rick?

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Yeah, he goes first.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Damn, we already discussed this, John.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** This is taken care of, John.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** Where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** You could have just said, Rick or Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** I'd be like, it's Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** Sorry, I was too busy multiplying the creature's HP by five.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Just when Rick's fine again.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Only when Rick attacks.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** For some reason, it's still alive.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:36]** Defense against androids.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Defense against androids.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** So we got this room with three doors.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** One on the west wall and two in the north wall.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:46]** Dr. K and Frog have run in from the north.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:49]** Well, Frog has run in and Dr. K is outside in the northeast corner.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** Here, you're in the northwest corner.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** And Rick, you are in the western corner.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** And it is your turn.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Ball's in your court.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Bernice is actually, like, looking over.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:05]** There's a big glass window that looks into the room, and Bernice is just kind of peeping over that edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** I thought you couldn't see through the window, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** How did Hrog get into this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** He's too big.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** It's just dark.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** He just squeezed in.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** He squished in.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** Okay.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:15]** Yeah, he just squished half his movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** He just kind of— He burst through.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** He probably broke it off its hinges like he did the other ones.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** No, he squeezed in because he's considerate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** This is fairly polite.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** He is pretty polite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** For an Akishti Rivener.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Strange.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Oh, is it my turn?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** You're in first.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** Rick hits the button to slide the door wide open and he's going to shoot.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** That's your full action.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** What?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Stop it, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:46]** The door doesn't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Really?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:47]** The door opens.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** The door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** What do you do?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** I shoot.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** Shoot to kill.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Dang, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** 12 plus 8 is a 20.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** 20 against what?

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** EAC?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** EAC.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** EAC.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** That is going to be a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Hit.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** It's a laser.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** I'm assuming lasers are here.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** We already should notice.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** It's been a while.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** That's a hit.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** That's a hit.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** That's a hit.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** That's a hit.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** Now I need to find my D10.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** My D10, he says.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** My D10.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** And I'm going to add another four to that.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** And so that is, ooh, 14 points of damage.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Dang, dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Get you nice damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:41]** You fire and it hits the back of this creature who stumbles forward and the head doesn't even turn and look at you.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** The head is looking at frog.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:50]** It's almost like if it wasn't pushed forward from the blast, it would not have even just reacted at all to the damage.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:54]** But you definitely dealt some bad damage.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** Nope, that is my turn because I opened the door and I shot.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Kicking the door, waving the 4-4.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** Dr. Okay, what you going to do?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** What is this thing, I wonder?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:12]** And can I roll life signs to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** You can roll life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** Of course.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Of course.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:22]** I got a 12 on the die plus 13 is 25.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:31]** Yeah, you are able to identify the creature and you are able to know one thing about the creature.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:37]** You know that this is a swarm Corvox creature.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:42]** Now, Swarm Corvoxes are shock troops for the Swarm.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:50]** They are advanced scouts, world seekers, and they move in these vast hordes across potential worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:55]** This is like the Force Recon version of a Swarm guy.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:15]** basically like sure marine marsock version yeah yeah they are they're pretty intense they're pretty pretty intense yeah uh what what do you want to know does it have any damage resistance since we've we've dove into that so far


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** It does not have damage resistance, no.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Oh, okay.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:28]** It does... I'm not going to be a super douche, and I will just say that it does have immunities to acid and fear effects, because that was close enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Okay.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Yep.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** And that's all you know.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** Well, the Kasa Jet won't work.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** Well, if I... You can inject, right?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** Yeah, I can use my, like... Can it, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** No.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Can we look?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** I don't know.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** Let's look at the description of how a costa jet works.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Kevin, here we go.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** I just love the description of a costa jet, though.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Will's so mad now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** No, I just spilled on my road.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Oh, no.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:11]** But the way it describes it is that the pellet or basically like whatever the injection is, is surrounded by like a coat of acid that eats through the target and that gives the injections.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:16]** Like that is, it's like if anybody knows like a heat missile.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:43]** how the missiles work it hits and then it burns you're saying that i can't use my costume i'm not i think you can still i think you can still do it because you're technically allowed to like notch no no i we'd have to read it but i i just like the the way it describes it i'll look it up we can come back to it but i think you should not have to this time because i think you can turn it off like if you're shooting your friends that's because you don't have to take ass damage yes i mean well then i think you would need to just turn it off if you wanted to do that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:43 - 00:25:11]** right oh dang john's doing it the hard way he's like saying it's not going to take damage if you do that you're now john's making it more difficult i'm sorry for bringing this up wait i'm confused i thought that if you want to still inject the creature you can do that it has immunity to acid anyway so you would just need to like oh yeah that the ass is not going to count so you're but you're wasting your shot though is what you're but no just you're saying i don't do any damage to it you wouldn't anyways no acid damage right oh well that sucks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:15]** So would the biohacks work against it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:15]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** The biohack would, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Yeah, it would still work because it would still go in.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** Right, but it's being injected via acid.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** I would think that the acid would just be burning it away, but it's not.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** In my mind, it's still damaging the creature.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:33]** It's not like the acid just falls off like water droplets on a water-resistant pants, right?

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** It would still go in.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** It just won't take any damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Okay.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** That's a second layer of skin that's fine or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Okay.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:56]** Well, I don't think that this thing will work against it, so I'm going to... Hey, Bernice, do you mind to shoot this guy for me?

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Okay.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:06]** Yeah, so Bernice is going to go in and just shoot with the... I forget the name of the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** The... Great question.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** I don't know.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** No one remembers.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** No one remembers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Not even Peppish Farms.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** It is the... Come on, open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Come on, open.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Open!

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Why won't you open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** There it is.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** You took the words right out of my mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** Sorry, I found the quote for the cost of jet.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:36]** Cost of jets create an injectable field that transforms ordinary matter into an acidic compound, disintegrating their target from the inside.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:48]** Syringes can be loaded into these weapons, allowing the materials to be quickly injected instead of acid discharge, in which case the only injection occurs and not the acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Yeah, I think you could still inject them if you wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Right, but I don't do any damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** But you'd still get the inhibitor or whatever you're trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Or the minor inhibitor.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Right, right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Yeah, it's up to you.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:03]** But you're going to use the vapor, the old VCP, as they call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Bernice is going to move in.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:11]** I'm going to take a... That's going to be like my... I'll put on the VR headset.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** And I'll move... I'll drive Bernice in.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Be like, let's go, Bernice.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Yeah.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Just in the middle of combat.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Just stumbling around the floor.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** And then you just start playing Beat Saber.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Yeah.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** I rolled a 17.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:38]** Wow, balling against a vapor cavitation pistol is kinetic damage, right?

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Yeah.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:43]** Then, boom, that hits the creature.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:47]** Dude, you guys are just knocking them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Well, we'll see about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** I mean, Krog hasn't even gotten a chance to hit this thing yet.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Yeah.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Oh, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** He's getting mad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** I'm trying to pull up the... It was mine to kill.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:59]** Okay, 1d6.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** Four points of damage from the vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** Again, the creature unresponsive from the damage.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:13]** Just dead thousand yard stare right at Frog.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** All right.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** But good damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** All right.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** What if Frog's the bad guy and the swarm guy is the good guy?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Oh, man.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Who knows?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Who could it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:29]** I would feel so, so, so like my life got twisted upside down.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** That happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** You got to move to Bel Air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** It's just here's Hoopin.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Look out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** All right.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:49]** My dirty bug cousin is just like, hey.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Here we go.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Yeah, that's him.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:53]** We're doing a little dance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Doing the Carlton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** It's too perfect.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** That's what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** I'll make you cool yet, Carlton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** My turn.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** No.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** It is Frog's turn.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Okay.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** It's Frog's turn.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:16]** Frog looks and probably Dr. K, you hear, unless you're playing Beat Saber really loud, you hear Frog.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:44]** just under his breath be like this is what you deserve this should help you and just breaking some of these uh these like computer stations that are in the way just runs through it and and standing like right on top of the computer station just moves and swings a massive claw at the creature this swarm corvox that i'm gonna roll where's that purple crack and die

**[00:29:45 - 00:30:09]** feels appropriate that is hey whoo a 23 to hit as boom hits the creature and the creature stumbles back taking oh my god taking 16 points of damage as one of its arms just seems to be like it is barely hanging on oh

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Oh, man.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** Frog, what a beast.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** I'm glad he's on our side.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** I'm glad he's on our side.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Dude, Frog will mess you up.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Here's at your turn.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Here's just like kick.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Wait, Rick, are you inside the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** The door's wide open, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** Here's, like, goes around this rubble next to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** And he just, like, hey, can you reach out to your gun real quick?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** Just reach it over.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** And he touches it.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** It goes.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:43]** And he supercharges Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** Nice.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Supercharge the weapon.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** That's an extra D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Is that right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** 4D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** 46.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** 46 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Additional damage, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** Additional.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** Additional damage.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** Has anyone done electricity damage?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Not besides Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** I have ENF on the vapor capitation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:26]** electricity and fire so you would notice that the electricity damage does seem to like sizzle and stay on the skin longer like this creature has some sort of possible weakness to electricity i'm gonna adjust accordingly i think it i think you can choose how much you do i'm gonna say at that time you didn't know so i'm just gonna say half half


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** I don't know what that means, but... It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:33]** Well, he's saying if you're a weapon, if you have the ability to choose your weapon... It doesn't give me the ability to choose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** Okay, then it might just be half and half, and I could be super wrong about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** It's plasma.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** It's superheated, electromagnetically charged gas.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:46]** Plasma weapons discharge blasts of this deadly substance and control fields.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:52]** Plasma weapons steal the most electricity and fire damage for unparalleled destructive powers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** I feel like I remember something about it does half and half.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** Kev's going to look that up?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** When you do more than one type of damage for a thing.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** You look that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** What's the name of the weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Vapor Cavitation Pistol.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** It's actually not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:11]** But isn't it also, it's got another name.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Because it's also a survival knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Oh, it's the transmutation matrix.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** So it's the transmutation matrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** Which sounds like a grad level math class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:25]** No, it's the cavitation pistol that gives you the... EF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Yeah, not the transmutation matrix.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** TM.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** Oh, I get it.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Wait.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Okay, cool.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:33]** All right.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** Kev, you look that up, let me know.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** CoroVox.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** Here's, you want to do anything else with the term besides supercharging?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Get back to the action.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:50]** If Here's does a life science check, could he find out some additional information such as the general KAC or EAC or something like that?

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** Or does that not work with life science checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** No.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** No, I'm not going to give you the KAC, EAC numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** All right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** It was worth a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Trying to be sneaky.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** 20 hits for EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** But you could try and figure out anything else if you wanted to.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** But you know a lot.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** It's up to you.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Any special attacks, perhaps.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Any special attacks that it could do.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** How about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:14]** I will say that you will need to be within line of sight.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Because I think you were standing outside the door and I don't think you opened the door.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Blind sense?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** No, no.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** To actually see the creature.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** You would need to be able to see the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** I see, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** I hear you.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** So if you want to go in or open a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:30]** Well, here's moved already to like supercharge a weapon.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** So I don't think he could.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** So unless he can move more for some reason.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Sad day for here.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** Here's just basically like, you know, gives Rick a shoulder massage.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** That's it.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** So he's out.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** Rick is going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Can you cast a spell and then move?

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** I don't know.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Because you can't move attack move.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Can you move cast a spell move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** No.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** It's either move or do a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** This is episode 61.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** You would think I would know.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** I don't know.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Wait, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** I missed all that because I was busy reading Reddit about what our energy was.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** I think it is half and half according to Reddit.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Correct us if we're wrong.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** I don't know where it says it in the book.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** I'll have to look it up.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** All of Reddit.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** Wait, so it was here's his turn and what did he do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:10]** Here's cast supercharged weapon on your gun.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** And that was it.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** And they just said, you know, make sure you hit.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** That was basically it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:21]** Oh, do you want to roll a diplomacy check or something to give me a vote?

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Can I do that, actually?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** No, John might let you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Dr. K, you were going to say something?

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** No.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** No, I wasn't.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:35]** I'm in dreamland with my VR headset, and Bernice is just like...

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:49]** Looking at the frog up from the floor, you know, cause like frog stepped in front of Bernice and is like crushed, crushed a desk full of like computers and stuff and started beating on this dude.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** Bernice is just like on the ground staring up.

**[00:34:53 - 00:35:00]** Like I'm there and I'm like, Ooh, Ooh, well this is fascinating to television.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** I love that.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I have a question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Yes, here's Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:09]** Could he use his inspiration to buff Rick?

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Sorry, what is his inspiration?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** He's got inspiration because he did a good pun one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** Oh, the punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:38]** well now we're getting into the punishment economy do you so you're saying you want to give the you want to give rick your punishment i do well what i what how this would look is like here's a basically just like pump like rick up you know it would be like you're the best like you know that kind of thing just to give him an advantage when he attacks that way that we can better be sure that this attack hits


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:42]** Except Kears is actually talking to the gun as he's rubbing it.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** You're going to do something.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** You're a good gun.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** You're a good gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:52]** I'll do whatever it takes within reason.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Can I do this?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** I'd like to.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** I really don't want this supercharged weapon to be wasted.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:18]** you don't want it to be wasted so you want the gun to have a re-roll okay not that kevin's a bad shot he's a good shot a good shot but no yeah of course not yeah it's definitely not up to random chance okay i think you can do this but you have to tell me what exactly it is that you say the gun that i'm talking to the gun yeah yeah i was curious what do you say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:44]** all right so here's just takes he just looks at the gun and he brings his little his little i don't know he takes his secret mandibles i don't know i don't know how far to take this yeah this is really weird really sexual i mean you can take it wherever you want i'm just trying to help you out here uh yeah we're trying to make this john's trying to get us to take off the explicit thing and here you are yeah i know right yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** We've dropped F-bombs.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:51]** We've talked about... I'm just trying to get you to be, you know... This is so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** I'm talking to a gun.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** All right.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** But you're talking to a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** So what is it that you say while you're doing this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Hey, big guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** He just takes, like, one hand.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:09]** And then just delicately traces these... This gun is composed of these different...

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** These different metal parts, right?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** You know, the seams.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Where those seams are.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:22]** He takes one hand, one finger, and delicately traces the seam from... From the nozzle?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Wow.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** From where the... Muzzle.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** The muzzle.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** The muzzle of the gun.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** I have shotguns before, I swear.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** And he takes it and he draws his finger all the way... I was there.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** To the butt of the gun.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Yeah, he was.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Will was there.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** And...

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:44]** And then he takes his other hand and just rubs his palm across and he's like, you served us so well all these days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** We've been trapped together, stuck together.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** I believe you can do it again.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Send it.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Send it.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Send it hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Brilliant.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:03]** And then he looks at Rick and he just gives him a knowing nod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Robert Redford nods and he just slowly smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** And then he looks forward.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Just like a cool look.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** An eager anticipation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** You're one of the funniest people on the planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** And then the gun winks back at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Alright, you got it.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** You were able to do it.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** Amazing.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Well done.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** That was great.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** That was too good.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** Alright, so you now have you no longer have a reroll.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** Kelly and Rick or Kevin, you have it.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** If you wanted, you could just not use it on this turn.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, just keep it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Just keep it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Don't use it.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** You have to not use it.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** If you do that, yours will be great.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Please do that.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** It will create a strain on your friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:58]** The problem is, like, Rick's so weirded out by that whole thing, he was just like, oh.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Okay.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Doesn't even roll.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** That was too good.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** Well done, Kelly.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** That was fantastic.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Yeah.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** That's Oscar award winning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Easily.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Easily.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Back to the action.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** End of round one here.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** The Korvox.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** Again, unflinching.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:28]** With all the damage, it's almost like it's just this ragdoll being pushed back and forward as parts of its body are flying off.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:44]** And just with this totally emotionless stare, probably, Rick, you see that the eye... Like, you don't see the eye turn, but you see this green laser, like, scan frog for just a brief second.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:50]** And then the one arm that is not... That is not, like...

**[00:39:50 - 00:40:16]** almost falling off you see at the bottom of the arm there seems to be this like triangle that just seems to heat up and get red then yellow then white hot in the matter of like less than a second and you just see the creature go in and try an upper cut frog with this brand let's see if it hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Don't die.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:23]** I thought he was going to, like... Because the storm is known for, like, chimera effects where they can take from their victims.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** I was like, oh, God.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:28]** He's going to turn into a giant riveter right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** Don't give John ideas, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** Hey, yeah, that's a great idea.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** Okay, so it...

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:44]** Hits Hrog, and you hear this as the smell of burnt Akesti flesh.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:53]** I don't know if the VR for Bernice has scent, but maybe you smell this wafting out the door, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** Definitely not something from the old factory that I want to visit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:04]** Definitely not, as I'm just going to tell you, nine points of damage to Hrog.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:14]** as there's this giant triangle mark and burnt skin on his stomach.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Okay, round two.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** We're back to Rick.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Are you or are you not going to use the reroll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** I'm going to use the reroll.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Missed out.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:27]** Can I use the reroll on the first of two attacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** The same rules apply.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** You're going to do two attacks?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** You can use the reroll when you want to use the reroll, but I think you need to use it.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** You need to declare it.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** Declare it before you attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** I do declare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** I do declare.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** I know that at 20 hits.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:48]** So if I can reroll, I have a good chance of hitting with my plus four as opposed to doing a plus eight and hitting it once.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** So I can do two plus fours to hit it and might be able to basically double my damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** One thing.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:58]** The creature did take a step into here.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Bum, bum, bum.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Squeezing right past the creature.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Whoa.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Yeah.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Does that affect me at all?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** No.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** I was just letting you know.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Because you can still see the creature.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** He didn't step past Frog.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** He stepped next to Frog.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Frog takes up a lot of space, as a large guest he does.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Back to your turn, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Go ahead.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** You know, I changed my mind.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** I'm going to just do a single shot.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Okay.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** And not to waste the supercharge.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** All right.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** That's what Cal is going to do.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:30]** Rick is going to, just for flavor's sake, is going to kneel down and just focus real hard on this creature.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Okay.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** As the words whispered into the gun...

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:49]** stream up into his echo through your mind blessed like the pope blessing golf clubs i got two d20s i'm just gonna roll at the same time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** Okay, almost in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Ooh, a six on one.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** And?

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** An 18 on the other.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Oh, you have my hopes up.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** But it's 18 plus eight, so it's a 26 that definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** 26 definitely hits.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Thank you for GMing that roll, Kev.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** How much damage do you do as this?

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** Wait, what?

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:12]** I feel like the gun is almost about to explode in your hands.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:18]** Your hands are shaking as you're trying to contain all this extra energy from the provocation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** I'll roll the low damage first.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:23]** That's a d10 to hit.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Okay.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:29]** And that's, ooh, 10 plus 4, so 14 points of damage.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** 14 points of damage.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** And then how many 6s do I roll?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** 4d6.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** 4d6.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** This is outrageous.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** That's 5.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** That's 3, so that's 8.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** 8.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Ooh, that's a 6.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:52]** And 2 for the last one, so 8 plus 8 is 16 for a total of... Dude, 30 points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** 36, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:16]** 30 oh my right 36 36 yeah it was 18 and was it 18 and 18 or no i don't remember now no it's 14 and 16 32 32 that's the numbers numbers math we're not numbers and math i always write them down so i'm visual i mean the the blinding light from this massive beam that shoots out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:36]** is almost like too much for you to see rick and maybe you squint a little bit after you fire as you let go and this just hits the creature right at the neck and you just see the neck and the torso almost vaporize and at the same moment

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:47]** Right next to Frog and Bernice, the head just also seems to glow with a different blue color, a different color than the beam, and it...

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:57]** And the head explodes and frog and Bernice need to make a reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** They're going to turn into a swarm.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** No.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Swarm Bernice.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** Dude, you blew up this creature.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:09]** I mean, I'm excited about that, but now I'm scared of what's going to happen next.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Reflex save.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Reflex save.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:21]** I meant to say I was going to roll a sense motive on this creature to see, like... But I guess it did attack Krog after all, but... It did, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Well, let's get to it in a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Oh, Jesus.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Bernice got a natural 20.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Thanks for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Natural 20?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Dang.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Impressive.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Yay, Bernice.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Okay.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** She survives.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Bernice, she does survive.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:46]** She does take two points of electricity damage, and so does Frog, as most of it was probably dissipated by the fact that it wasn't the entire body that could explode.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** It was just the head.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:54]** But as it slumps to the ground, there are just two shearing legs on the ground, swarm legs.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** And two of these arms, one seems to each have a different type of weapon.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:05]** And you all are out of combat as the electricity dissipates in the air.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:13]** And for a second, the lights go down and come back up as maybe one arc hit a light.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** And you are alone in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** That was like one of our easiest fights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Because we brought a Rivner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** I know.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** Thank you, Kelly, for the supercharge.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** It was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:31]** Thanks for landing that sweet shot.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** I did it with your inspiration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Bernice.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:41]** Well, Bernice notices that Frog bends down.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Does he hurt?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** And seems to.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Sorry?

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** Does he hurt?

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** Frog, if you die now, I'm going to kick your ass.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** Frog took damage, too.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** He barely took any damage, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** He better not die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:51 - 00:47:00]** Frog bends down and looks over the... Sorry, starts to look over the shearing and kind of collect what's left of the shearing.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Rick, you walk in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** I think we all did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:09]** Enters the room and examines briefly the Sharon, but he's more concerned with rug.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Yeah.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:18]** So, uh, he's going to ask if he can take a look and, uh, see if he could, I can, I can like heal him.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** What'd he say?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** Uh, Hey, you took a nice hit there.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:28]** Uh, can I take a look at your, your wounds or are you under any effects?

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:33]** Oh, I'm fine.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** I'm fine.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:41]** Just trying to memorialize someone that might not get remembered.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:47]** So, yeah, sure, yeah, you can hear me.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** I won't feel it.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Just do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** Okay, and I think I can do long-term care.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** How long is that to?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** Well, it's like, it's over the course of a day or more.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:07]** If you succeed with the check, patient recovers hit points and ability score damage, as well as recovers from poison states at twice the normal rate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** I feel like we would, if you want to take the whole day to do that, but I feel like you need to.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** I mean, Frog definitely doesn't seem like he's super.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:20]** I'd be fine if you didn't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:41]** save it for yourself okay so what are ricky is probably just hurting to his stamina points maybe you should just take a 10 minute rest and burn a tell her to burn a resolve i don't have stamina points or resolve so you don't no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** So what is everyone doing?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Dr.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** O.K., you look down.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** I can tell you what you see remaining of the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** Is there any cool items to scrounge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Yeah, there are.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Well, attached to each arm, right?

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Yeah.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:06]** One arm, the one that was almost about to fall off, has a six notch forked pistol.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:19]** As you see these two arcs between two long tines, sorry, six long tines of the pistol as each tine would amplify the power that's coming down the length of the weapon.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:24]** So it's a six notch forked pistol on one arm, but it's integrated into the arm.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:29]** The other one would be a red star solar brand.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:34]** And you do see that the end of it has this triangle on it.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** And that seems to be heated up again, integrated into the arm.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:46]** And as the color of the stars goes up for the type of the weapon, then that's how the weapon gets to be.

**[00:49:46 - 00:50:06]** more and more uh powerful so i think what was the name of again six uh six notch forked pistol sounds cool and a red star solar brand awesome red star does 1d6 red stars are 1d6 ef 1d6 ef forked pistol is 1d3 ef

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** So what do you all want to do?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:16]** You could probably take those and I think you would need to spend some time getting it unintegrated from the arm in order to use it right.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** You might have to do a couple of checks on it.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Probably couldn't do it.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** You would need at least a few hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Rick takes his axe and just cuts it off.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** It's going to take two hours to get it off of this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:32]** Just to get it off and then get it working because it was integrated into the creature.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** So just to get everything off, it'll probably take you about two hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Yeah, I don't.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** I mean, it'd be nice, but I don't need this stuff.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** 1d3 doesn't sound like that much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Yeah, not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:51]** The 6-notch doesn't seem like that much of a great find, to be honest.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** It'll fetch 720 credits, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** Ooh, could still take the arm with you.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Just take a Corvox arm.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** Just drag his entire corpse at this point.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** All around.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Drag his entire corpse.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** All right.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** What do Rick and Hears want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** And what is everyone thinking?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:14]** Hears remembers Frog mentioning that there was some possibly useful information in here, I think.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** So he's going to check out the systems, the computers.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** The one that remains, I should say.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Not damaged.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** Not damaged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** Yeah, so the computers have no power to them.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** So you can't... Yeah, yeah, there's nothing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:30]** But what you do see... Drag the body of the swarm thing over to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:40]** Well, what you do see is that in the bottom part of the room, you can see here that there are three of these purple bodies.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:47]** And as you get closer, you can see that they are more swarm Corvoxes.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** and each one doesn't have a head, as if a cortex bomb went off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** That is right here.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** This one does not.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:04]** So there's four of these tube-looking things that are all shattered, and the third one from the left is empty.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** The assumption is that that's the one that this swarm thing came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** So there's nothing to get in this room anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Well, does anyone do a perception check?

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** Here's the perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** Yeah, Rick was going to walk over and do a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Okay, so let's go around.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Here's what you get.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** Here's got a 14.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** 14.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** What did Rick get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** For perception, 15.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** 15.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** What did Dr. O'Kickett get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:56]** perception on my character she is 12 so i got a 15 or 25 sorry 25 okay i got 13 plus uh 12 yeah okay rick and uh rick and here's you both look around you're kicking around you're like there's nothing here and dr k is like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Hang on.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:03]** And Frog, this whole time, has just been sitting down looking at this dead Corvox.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:11]** But, Dr. O'Keefe, you do see that there seems to be something that has writing on it, but you pick it up and it's like a tiny little part of a metal.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:16]** It looks like it was maybe part of some sort of a tablet or some larger piece of equipment.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Among the wreckage here, you don't know where that is.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** You don't know what's going on with that.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** It does seem like...

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:32]** There's words on it, but they're all covered in black and char from maybe some chemicals that you wipe off.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** You just noticed a couple etchings in it.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** And it's a piece of metal.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:42]** Again, ends are chipped or burnt or ripped, torn.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:51]** And in Aklo, it has the letters N-E-K-R-A-L-L.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Nekral.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Nekral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** And that is just not a word.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** That's when you translate it.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** That's what it comes out to be, Nacral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** So it's not a word in Aklo.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** It's just letters in Aklo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** It's letters in Aklo that spell out the word Nacral.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** What kind of object is it?

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** It's just a little tiny piece of metal.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:17]** It's like if the bottom of an iPad was broken and shattered, and it seems like it was part of something larger, but it's just a little sliver of metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:22]** Could I do an engineering check to see what it was part of?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:27]** I was going to say, who has the relic thing from the Chimera?

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** Are you still holding on to that, Kelly?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** I still have that, yes.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:38]** Rick will ask you, is this related to the relic from the Chimera at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Here's, we'll try to determine that.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** I think I could use mysticism, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** I think, sure.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I mean, you could.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** You pull out the relic.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** Yeah, the relic, and it's glowing a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Metal?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** Well, the metal itself wasn't glowing, right?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** It was your stone.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** It was your blue stone that would do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Well, glowing pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Tell us more about this stone.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:02]** Give me a physical science check here.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Okay.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:06]** Or anybody's trying to look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** 18.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** 18.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** 14.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** I don't have... Oh, I do have physical science.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:14]** I'll try to support with a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:20]** So 22, and then you both aid, so then it's 22, actually.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** 22, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Funny how that works out.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** They do seem like they're made of the same metal.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** So... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Beskar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** Trademark.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:35]** Do we know what... Okay, so it says, it spells it out in Aklo, but that's not a word in Aklo.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Is that what you're saying, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** It's not a word that you know.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** You would have to do a check on it to see if you know anything about that.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Sure.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** I was going to say, I'll try to support on a culture check.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** I'll roll culture check.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** I'll roll culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Here's a system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** I got a 16, so I assist.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Okay, 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** So 29.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Yeah.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:01]** Dr. O'Kate, there's only one thing that comes up in your mind.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** You're like, what is Necromancer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** That's a weird wordle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Yeah, it's almost a wordle.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** You are thinking back.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:19]** The way the word sounds, the etymology of it, it reminds you of the Baratheon language.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** The phrase that comes to your mind is like, megamind.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** And that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Megamind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** Yeah, megamind.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** That's it.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** That's all that you can remember.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** Because you know that Barathus can kind of merge and not merge.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:46]** The term to crawl is like, I feel like I read it in a headline when I was scrolling one day on trying to catch up on the news.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** Is it something like Hivemind, Megamind, in a sense?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** In a sense.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:54]** You would remember that Barathus can combine...

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:04]** And that the confluence, the leading Baratheon governmental entity, is technically hundreds of thousands of Baratheons that have merged into one mind.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:11]** And part of them move out to be entities, but they are part of the superstructure, this mega mind, if you will.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** Fascinating.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:19]** And here's when you, maybe just for curiosity, you pull out the blue object that you have.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:28]** And it lights up as it goes next to the metal that holds the thing, possibly the last remaining thing from the chimera.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:33]** And as you move it over to this thing, it also lights up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:33]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** The thing lights up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** No, the stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Wait, what?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** My God.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** So it's the metal that's activating this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Possibly.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** It's the thing that Hears has.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** It's just a magnet.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** It's the other way around.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** The metals are activating this.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** It's just a light-up magnet.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** That would be very disappointing.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** It's like a glow rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:01]** It's literally a nightlight.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** That's all it is.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** It's a nightlight.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** That's the mystery of the camera.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Just kidding.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** I have more.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** It's a nightlight.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** That's the.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** The whole threefold mystery is where is my nightlight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Where was my nightlight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:13]** I was looking for this nightlight the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:35]** Of the myriad of reasons that you could love a tabletop RPG, I really think that the humor, the jokes, the fun, silly, crazy, zany things that you add to the table, to the story with your friends have to be, for me, top three.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** If not, top two.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** If not...

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:54]** top one most important fun things and reasons why i love tabletop rpgs because in that moment for all the things that needed to happen for that joke to happen or that moment to happen to land and for everyone to just have a good time it's remarkable it's like an inside joke of an inside joke right because you're inside the world

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:59]** Anyway, we're always happy that you are at the table with us to have those jokes.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** You know what to do.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Rate and review.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Come hang out on the Discord.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** We want to hear from you.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:09]** Until then, you'll hear from us next Will Save Wednesday.
