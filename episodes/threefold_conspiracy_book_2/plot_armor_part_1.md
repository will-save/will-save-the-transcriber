**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Cool.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:59]** Well, you all know who I am, but I think it might be good to start going around the horn here just so you can get a brief refresher if you didn't know after 28 episodes who everyone is.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** So who wants to go first?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** Say who you are, who your character is.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** So I'm Nick Belcher.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** I play Nico Ryan on the Will Save podcast here.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:22]** My day job, I work as an outside salesperson, and I write the music in conjunction with John Swan for Will Save.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** That is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** I can't see it, but I'm holding on the rock on fingers.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** And my night job.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** At night, as the sun goes down, you become Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** You know, I thought I'd get, like, a cheers for that, but, like, the love is just overwhelming right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** International menace and arms dealer pirate.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** We don't know.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Rapid shot.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Yeah, it's quickfire.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Quickfire.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** You run around the streets of downtown Los Angeles.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** It's quickfire.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** The vigilante superhero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** Fast guns.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** With my trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** With your trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Who's next?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Swift pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** That sounds so wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** Especially in a trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Perhaps.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yes.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** I think, Kelly, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** Kelly, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:22]** Uh, in the day I, I'm a programmer is what I do.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** And it, uh, it's good.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:28]** And at nighttime when I'm tired of being a human, I become a Sheeran.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** His name is here is that's what I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:36]** I do like this idea that at night we all just transform into our characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** Except we usually record as the sun's going down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Yeah.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** Well, it's kind of like a curse, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Yeah, me too, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** We did that once on a Sunday morning.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** That was really nice.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** But that's just because you guys wake up early.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** I do not want to be recording early.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** I want to just end out my day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:57]** Except you don't go to sleep until 4 a.m., so just don't go to sleep that night.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** That's not true.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** I go to bed at 1, then I get up at 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** It's a good, healthy schedule.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** All right, I'll go.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** Anyway, I'll go.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Everyone, I'm Kevin.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:11]** I also play Rick19, the android.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:18]** By day, I am a mechanisms engineer for the space industry.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** And by night, I am an Android bounty hunter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** I like it.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Casual.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** We call it something else internally, but yeah.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Let's call it Android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I'm called something else internally?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Oh, you mean the murder bot?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]** No, that's a nickname given to me by Swift Pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Do you have a nickname internally in your company?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Swift Pistol.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** Kelly, you got me on that one so good.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** I don't currently.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** A call sign?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:48]** Have you had a nickname assigned to you while at work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Like a call sign?

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** No, I've not had an official call sign.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** No call sign?

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** No.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Engineers don't really get call signs, I don't think.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Do they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Yeah, not really.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Wait, is that just like a nickname?

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** My call sign at work is Belcher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:04]** I've never really had a nickname either, except we talked about this once before, right?

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** Back in high school, I was called Milky because I liked Milky.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:12]** Yeah, I guess I'm Will.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** My turn to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** It's your turn, Will!

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Get that enthusiasm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** Yeah.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** Will, no relation to the podcast.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:29]** Garrett is unnamed after me.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Just my name.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** I always thought it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** We haven't gotten any cease and desist from anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** No one has said anything.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Will, who do you play?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I'm sorry, what?

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** By day, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** By day, I'm a mild manner software engineer.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** That's your role?

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That's your class?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** No, no.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** Plus five to pass aggressive emails.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** Plus five to pass aggressive.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Plus nine to energy.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** Plus nine to speed when I drink my coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** He crossed classes into a 3D printer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:23]** I'll just leave in the funny laugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:29]** I don't know if you guys should know this, but anytime you say we should cut that, it doesn't get cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** I know.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Kevin is right.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** Kevin is almost certainly out.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** It's not true.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** I'm going to hard stop.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** I do mostly cut most of the things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:53]** We can leave the laughter at the reaction and say, unfortunately, couldn't share what we just said, but it was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:59]** You know what would be so much better is if, like, yeah, just bleep all of Will's, like, thing about himself.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** Hi, guys.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** I'm Will.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** And bleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** But since this is Pod Armor, and we'll probably get to it later, but we can talk about this stuff.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** There is an episode where Nick was like, bleep, and he bleeped himself.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:15]** But then John went back and actually bleeped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** Yeah, because Nick said, oh, we should bleep it.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** And then I...

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:28]** Whenever we say, oh, we should put this in, I always put it in, and then I leave the part where we say we want to put it in so everyone knows that we're a very meta podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:35]** I just think we should bleep every time we swear anyway because bleeps are so much funnier than the actual swear word itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** You should bleep when we're not swearing.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** That's what's funniest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** So, Will, what do you do at night?

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:45]** Bleep, bleep, bleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:56]** I guess I inject pharmacological inhibitors into space lice repeatedly.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** And grow tentacles out of your face.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** And grow tentacles out of my face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I love it.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Someone has to do it.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:14]** I speak in a low, slow voice because my thoughts are well constructed and I must act slowly.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** I can't afford not to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** My thoughts are considered constructed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** Because they are literally constructed.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:27]** All right, well, here, I just want to give some expectations now that we've really said nothing about what Plot Armor is.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:38]** So I really just kind of want to set some expectations for you listeners, which is just to say that we're going to go through, walk through, second by second,

**[00:08:38 - 00:09:06]** of book one and go through where all the players can air some grievances or ask questions and I will do my best to answer them or not and we're also just going to talk about the structure of Starfinder versus some other games and just go in a little bit behind the scenes for you in case you were wondering which is why this is a bonus episode for all you really hardcore willing people out there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Because the saved was taken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** The saved is a term.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Not sure where it came from, but that's used, obviously.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** So we have to go with the willing.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Somebody called about that one.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Hashtag the willing.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Hashtag the willing.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Yes.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** Cool.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** So let's talk a little bit about the game.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Starfinder.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Starfinder.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Starfinder.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** And I just want to ask real quick.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** I want to poll our players here and anybody listening.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:36]** If you have never played any TTRPG, again, what are you waiting for?

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:41]** Yeah, Kev's never played, and he's still on the podcast, so you can have a good time, too, and play.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** But here's the thing.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:50]** If you have played and you've played more than Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder, especially if you've played Starfinder...

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Well, here's the question, though.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** Here's the question, because we actually got started playing Dungeons.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** And Dragons.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** Like, what is it, two years ago?

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Two and a half years ago?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** Yeah, quick scan across the room, except for Will.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:18]** what have been some of the big changes that you've seen now that we're done with, you know, one book of Starfinder and we're pretty, you know, we're solidly into our D&D campaign.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:25]** What are some of the big differences that you've noticed besides in-person, virtual, all that stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** You mean like as players, what has changed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** What is different about the game system as a player?

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** Yeah, like what do you like, what do you not like?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** Characters or... Yeah, any of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** I mean, one thing to note is that all of us as players have gotten better as players.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:48]** Not only have you gotten better at abiding by the rules, because when you first walk into a game, and this isn't to scare anybody off, there are a lot of rules.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:55]** But as you get to learn them and everything, I feel like the mechanics start to be a little smoother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:01]** Well, it's also like learning how to find the information that you need to...

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:16]** play it's not so much you have to learn everything all at once but um you don't need to know like starship combat you haven't even touched that um we were recording this episode i mean yeah yeah but also i think we have to say nothing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:23]** I think the other half of role-play games, besides the dice rolling and the rules, the other half is the role-play aspect.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** Which, again, at home, as you're playing your own games, you don't have to play as a character and do voices and stuff.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:33]** But it does make it fun and it helps in...

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** make you dive into the world that you're playing in.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:54]** Um, and out of the, out of the six of us or five of us playing, um, I feel like each of us has actually gotten better at doing that about turning your character on and off and actually diving into who your character is and separating that from who you are as a player and, and just like getting into your voices and your characters.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** John is fantastic by the way, as our GM, um,

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:02]** Because not only is he doing himself, he's doing every character that's not one of the four players.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** So good job, John.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** That's one of the things I want to say is I've watched you guys grow.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** And I know I'm the only one that has any kind of actual background in acting.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** But it's great to see all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** I did go to State Festival twice in high school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** And I've been in musical theater productions three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** I was in a Corn Flake commercial.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** I majored in liberal arts.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:32]** Now that we've hit the cliches about theater, about, you know, has actual real acting stuff.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I was Ebenezer Scrooge.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Oh, that sounds like such a fun role to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** It fits you perfectly.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** It really does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** Kevin's point about separating yourself from your character is so true.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:50]** That was the biggest transformation for me personally, was being able to completely see what the character would do as opposed to what I would do.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:56]** Yeah, and I think as a GM too, once you... I...

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:02]** I mean, not to get too ahead of ourselves, but we all, I think, are going to GM at some point, some degree.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:18]** And I think once you do that and you put yourself into the spot of multiple characters and then you start playing out how reactions and plots and things go, then it puts how you are a player and you develop your own central individual plot with regards to everybody else.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** It really starts to kind of hone things down.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:47]** together and i definitely agree with kev that uh myself but definitely all of you have have just like skyrocketed uh in terms of your role playing and all of us and it's been fun doing really good any other challenges well i was gonna say nick with nick his character nico has actually evolved as well just in the timeline of this you know podcast we've heard him go from this young here we go you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:48 - 00:14:01]** to like this wild west oil rig owner like and then back to i believe who nico really is uh and i think it's good to see you find yourself and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:07]** I feel like you went through a very... You just danced around the issue, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** What do you really want to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** No, I'm just... I think I called you out at the time about your consistency.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:18]** It was like one week to one week, you completely forgot what voice you were using.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** Oh, like that southern barren voice.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Yeah.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** It turns out great.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** It's funny.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** It makes good radio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** True, true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:34]** I'd say for me, the biggest thing were learning how the new skill checks operated.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** From D&D, it's a bit of a departure.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:47]** There's a lot more you can do from Starfinder to D&D as far as what skill checks you can do, what you can do with those skill checks.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:50]** Then again, it's a much more complicated world.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:59]** D&D, you're primarily operating in a fantasy world, where Starfinder, you're operating in a world where you have electronics, you have the computer, you have...

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:07]** all sorts of machinations that can be used, manipulated or blown up or rigged for that.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:15]** But at the same time, like with, with, uh, here's it's, there's still an aspect of magic involved and exactly.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** So, cause they're, you're like, he is a technomancer.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** So there's the idea that you can use magic and blend it in with technology is really creative too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** It is.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:27]** And all it's, it's just, there's just so much more.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** And, um,

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:37]** I think it really helped all of us starting at D&D first and getting an idea of just kind of like the play format.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** So that way going into Starfinder, we at least like, okay, so all right.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** What are the departures from just the regular roll of the dice?

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** And then we adapt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Jumping in cold feet.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** This game is going to be really fun.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** It's going to take you a little bit longer.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** My honest opinion on it.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Love you, Paizo.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** You guys create a great game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I don't think that's necessarily fair.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:06]** I think if you're trying to do it like we're doing it, then maybe jumping in is hard.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:10]** But, like, the one shot was super easy to jump in that we played.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Oh, that's very true.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Into the unknown.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** I agree.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** That's true.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:24]** Because they actually, like, label out... They do a good job of... What I like about Starfinder versus other systems, be it D&D or...

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:28]** Well, let's talk about TD.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** No spoilers.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:34]** The skills that you can flush out are a bit different.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** How you can apply them.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** You can't do everything necessarily.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** So you have a lot of...

**[00:16:42 - 00:17:01]** customization and specialization that you can really make your own that you adapt for your character as you play so I think that's really cool thing to apply as you're building and running a campaign and yeah I agree with that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:17]** yeah there's a lot of just comparing the two i think dungeon dragons does a great job of adding in a lot of customization but there just is inherently a lot more in starfinder the mechanics aren't they don't play as well in my opinion


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:22]** Just for everybody at home, the D&D that we were playing was 5th edition.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Yeah.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** Because I know there's a whole argument about which edition of D&D is better.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** 4 is obviously the best.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** No, it's 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** 2?

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** 2 hit AC being 0 is my favorite.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** That's a joke.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** That's satire.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:57]** is lost on everyone who doesn't know second edition yeah yeah but one of the one of the things that i i think i noticed the most between dungeons and dragons and the pathfinder starfinder universe is the skill checks and how they they are proportional to your level yeah where you don't really get skill increases

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:26]** in D&D that you do in Starfinder because when we get to higher levels in Starfinders we're going to be rolling 40s and 50s in order to beat these DCs of 40 and 50 where in D&D it kind of just stays at a general I'm trying to take a feat we just completed a book and a level and I don't know if we're going to talk about it but maybe on the actual show yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** Yeah.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:35]** But you can boost, like, depending on your kind of path of what you select, you can kind of boost along the way different skills.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** It's kind of interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:47]** A lot more ways to make your particular race theme class different than somebody else who has a very similar race theme class.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** You can do a lot along the way that really changes that.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** That's really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Either way, both games are really fun.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** And if you haven't played, find a game, get into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:00]** And you can play customized D&D campaigns and rule sets.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** It's not like you're limited.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** It's just, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:16]** And I think my advice for somebody who's never played is to find somebody who's been a GM before or who's willing to GM and then start off with a pre-made character because a lot of games have pre-generated characters.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Totally.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** That way you're not lost in the character generation of it.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:24]** You can focus on how to play the game and then later on learn how to build a character yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Yeah.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** And then to that DM or GM, make sure that whatever adventure you run, you level them up.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:43]** You level up the pre-written character in so much as then your players, new or old, get a chance to learn how to level up in that system and just do it in like a session zero-esque way, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** That's what I was going to say.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:53]** That was really helpful for me getting a feel for the game of Starfinder when we did that in our pre-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:15]** game where we had our pre-gen characters we leveled them up so like i got to see like oh this is what you can do with solarians it's pretty cool yeah yeah and then ultimately after you played for about a year then you start to buy microphones and start recording a podcast yeah it's weird it just happens it just becomes an urge and you're just like i just want to record it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** I gotta get that Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** So, I mean, we love both D&D and Starfinder.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** We miss our D&D game.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** We don't miss it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** I don't miss it.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:31]** You don't miss being... You don't miss being Cade?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** Wait, what?

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** It is eternal.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:54]** yeah it it it is nice to play the dnd game and there's like no microphones it's just us like the game that we started playing and then when you compare it with something that you're recording this game i love it yep it's good we did a lot and then we also love our star finder bullshit in that game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** They got ridiculous, man.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** It's just one of those things.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:05]** We tried to tame some wolves and a bunch of them slipped on a bunch of ball bearings off of bridges and stuff.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** It was just insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** We were always trying to manipulate our enemies to fight each other instead of us.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** You still do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** That still happens.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** I think you've carried that over in Starfinder.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** That's been a lot.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Mostly Rick being like, you don't have to do this.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:26]** Well, actually, we missed a couple, like, listening back.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Like, we've missed a couple opportunities to do that.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** But then again, it wasn't immediately obvious, though, either.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** So, I mean, maybe this is a good pivot for maybe our next line item.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** But, I mean, I re-listened to episode 12.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** I've listened to it, like, three times recently.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:49]** Because, like, low-key, it was probably one of the more important episodes of this book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** A lot happened in there, but we'll get to that.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Don't rush into episode 12.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** Let's start from episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** Thank you for that silver platter segue, Nick.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** That was so good.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** And we indeed are going to start.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Bravo, Nick.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Round of applause.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** I think we have a drop for that, right, Will?

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Yeah, we'll add it in post.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** It's fine.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** We can delete the praise.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** I love you guys, but I don't think the fans are going to really like that.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Sorry, those for you driving.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** I don't need applause.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:24]** But if you want to give it to me while you're driving or at the stoplight, do your worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Yeah, please don't.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Yeah, not while driving.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** Be safe.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Be safe always.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** That's our second motto.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** So here's the thing.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** This section, we're going to walk through, quote unquote, second by second.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:40]** But the thing is that we're going to hit a lot of the major highlights.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:52]** And this is really for me to talk about anything that I wanted to add to answer questions you guys have or challenges you guys faced or critiques of that event that happened.

**[00:22:52 - 00:23:16]** roleplay that encounter whatever it's going to be but we're going to hit those major beats in book one and so we're going to start with episode one sorry episode two but also including episode one of uh being in the docking bay and having that first encounter with magua who is the kasapan that uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:43]** agent larue was talking to so again if you guys are like we don't have any thoughts about that that was totally fine it was fun it was cool then we'll just move on you know like it's fine we're not looking for problems so episode one was the introductory where um and and just for our fans to know expo one is actually pretty well scripted we each wrote up our backstories with john the gm and so we we practiced them and rolled through them we were given a prompt


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:42 - 00:24:07]** yeah so i decided that we were yeah i had like a very loose like set of this is kind of where you'll be and this is kind of where you'll be going and you need to come up with uh like in your character creation make sure you come up with reasons and then come up with a story for why you would end up at this place and then we'll go from there

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:15]** And as Kev said, very heavily scripted and edited in terms of the story, sound effects, characters.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Even music.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** The music.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:24]** The thing that the players didn't know was they didn't know the questioning from Agent LaRue.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** They didn't know the context about their story.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** They didn't know like...

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** You didn't know how it was going to come up or quite when.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:36]** You just knew a general order of and your story, your script.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** And you didn't even know each other's stories.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** It's not like we all were sitting in one room.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** We did it.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Yeah.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** Complete surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** And that's something.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:47]** So what we did was we took a small...

**[00:24:47 - 00:25:09]** clip of what happened to each character prior to meeting at the docks so i don't i think this is actually a really good time let's run through and just do a you know two to three sentence breakdown of what happened in your flashback of yes the previous quote-unquote 24 hours hour so i guess i'll start off um rick is a bounty hunter and he finds a vesk

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:30]** that he's tracking down, and while he's fighting this Vesk that he's trying to take in for the android abolitionist front because he's presumably a slaver, he has some kind of vision blur and hears things, and things start going crazy in his mind, and he actually accidentally shoots the Vesk and kills the Vesk.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:36]** And from that point, he is told by the abolitionist front to head back to Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:38]** Good story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:47]** That flashback, I thought, for some reason, your story made me think that you were going through some kind of existential transformation inside or something like that.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** Honestly, I don't even know at this point.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** I worked with John.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** He was like, oh, this is going to be great.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** And we rolled with it.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:04]** But this is one of the things about being, this is a plot arc, so we can talk about it, is that our stories, we don't know where they're going to go.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** John's in control of that.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:14]** So that flashback or whatever was happening during my intro, I don't know as a player what was happening there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** I thought that that was your invention.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Got you.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Yeah.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Cool.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Nope.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** There are certain things and like a peek behind the GM screen.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:36]** When I'm talking to y'all about like your character backstories, what I'll frequently do is like you will reach out or I'll reach out and be like, this is a cool idea.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** And then I'm like, is that idea a hard and fast idea?

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** Or is that a like launching point for some new inspiration that's going to happen?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** And so then it helps kind of like...

**[00:26:48 - 00:27:09]** it helps kind of uh uh what's what's the word kind of shape it to be like do you want this to happen because this is a cool thing for your character and i want the coolest things for your characters because that's the cool part about playing star finders you can do super cool freaking cool stuff in freaking cool space or is it just like i think something like this might be interesting as like a launching point and then i don't want to know anything else

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** And to be honest, all of you are across the board.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** Some of you are like, hey, here's the bare bones stuff and see at the end, let me know what happens.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** And then some of you are like, I really like this very specific thing.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** And that would be really cool if that happened.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** And I want to see that happen.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:30]** And then I'm like, okay, then just to be clear, here are the bounds of that box and everything else that happens around the box is up to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** And during those meetings, you're rolling 20s to persuade each other constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** All the time.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** All the time.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** All the time.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** That's real life negotiation right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:42]** I really suck at rolling.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** That's what they don't tell you.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** before you get into the NBA program.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** And when they do, they send you a set of dice.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** They send you a D20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** When you're competing for big D20 salaries in banking, that's what you have to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Roll D20s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** At a certain point, it becomes D100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:03]** It's actually closest to the hole, really.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** It's closest to the hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** The big secrets banks don't want you to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** We teach you many things on this podcast.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** It's the dude who putts it closest to the hole.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Who putts it closest to the hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:20]** So we had Kev and Rick on the roof, and then I think next was Hears, right?

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Yeah, it was Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** You want to give us a brief summary?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:37]** Yeah, so Hears meets up with an old friend of his named Rolu, and Hears has just kind of recently, a few months ago, been kicked out of the Free Captains for reasons which are not known to you yet.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:42]** And then Rolu gives him something that will help him

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** get back in.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:49]** But before he could really explain what it is, he's shot by an assassin sent from the Free Captains.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** And he dies.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** And then he gets...

**[00:28:52 - 00:29:12]** pissed and then cast a spell on that guy transforms into some kind of crazy otherworldly creature and then runs hides finds his note that says this is the way back in and then a blue light comes to his eyes as he takes off the piece of paper so the object in your hand was glowing yes the object in the hand is uh is like a container that has like a blue glowing thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:37]** cool i have a question for this was that spell so the spell you use in that intro i mean like as as a player listening to this i was like oh my god you talk about how like his hands start to twist and mutate and and collapse almost what spell was that and do you do you actually have that spell or is this a flavor thing that actually is a spell and it's called wish yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:37 - 00:30:06]** wish oh yeah that's similar to dnd where you can wish whatever you want to happen it's it's pretty it's been a while since i looked at it but there was there it does a lot like yeah there's a great possibility of things you can do like across the board with it um and that creature is an actual creature in the stars starfighter universe as well an actual way yeah and and just for everyone at home who's like what you use a spell that's wish there's not the level i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:12]** I'm like 99% sure that when we were talking about your story, you were like, hey, is it cool if I use the spell?

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** And I think it's like a third party thing, so it's not official Paizo.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:23]** But it is above board in the sense that I think it's like a very limited sense of wish.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:28]** It's not like the D&D wish where you just get to do anything, like I want to topple that civilization.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:32]** I think it's like you could actually cast it right now if you wanted to take it.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** It wasn't like it was a huge...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** Because D&D Wish is like the ultimate spell.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Yeah, Wish is crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** Yeah, I think it's more like Thaumaturgy.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Well, yeah, Thaumaturgy.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:46]** What Ko would use a lot in Nick's character.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Pyromancy or Pyrokinesis or something.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** The flames turn blue.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:59]** Yeah, like you do have control and things do change, but they are temporary and or like more of an illusion.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** I think like Pyrokinesis is like actual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:10]** Yeah, so it's like it had a lot that it could make happen, I guess.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:15]** It's been a while since I looked at it, but you couldn't be that powerful or deep, but you could do a lot of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** It was an OP, yeah.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** But that was a good story.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** That was a fun story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** Yeah, it was a fantastic story.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** A lot of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Yeah, it was good.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:29]** And then as we found out later on, that relic that you got, or that piece that you got from Rolo became something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** It did.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Dun, dun, dun.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** We'll touch that later.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Next in line was actually Dr.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** O.K.,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:37 - 00:32:02]** yes dr okay um dr okays we we meet dr okay uh in the interrogation room um under circumstances we don't know maybe he was asking too many questions and they just brought him in to like harass him or or uh maybe maybe he's wanted and there's some some game afoot but we don't know

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** And I don't think Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** really knows.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:17]** And so he's there because prior his colleague and his mentor research partner is, you know.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:42]** in in one of our sort of not shady dealings but maybe private research together as a team we are uh dealing with these gentlemen and my colleague disappears and so i'm in this pursuit of understanding the circumstances and the new reality that i'm now faced with um

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:49]** Playing it on a sharu is like a timid but also curious.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:56]** So like kind of curiosity, killing the cat or biting at the apple of knowledge.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:02]** The condition of seeking that sort of...

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:09]** Higher understanding being one's own demise is what I'm trying to explore with him as a character.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** So that's his motives.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Nice.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Preview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:23]** And I like to... I think it puts it into context when you read that Osharu's really aren't solitary creatures at all.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** No.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** They are adverse to that, in fact.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:30]** They need companionship and or at least some other person there with them.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** And they don't travel or leave...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:54]** uh without each other and so yeah so the fact that you don't have dr bruce dacus is and and it's like i feel personally responsible maybe um because i have to i have to now uncover what's at foot because i don't like the new realities of what what is at stake might be everything to me because that's what it is but then


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** So back, back to, you know, the, the behind the scenes stuff.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Do you have any idea what actually happened to?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** No.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** So that is all up to John.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** Wow.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** That's crazy.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Keep listening and you'll find out.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Yeah.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Yeah.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** We're like your new family.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:19]** I was just going to say like, without his slug friends, like we're all that he has.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** We're here for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** We're like family now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** Just don't walk around in the middle of battle again.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Yeah.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** I think I love you, Dr. OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Is it just me or are you guys eating at an olive garden?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:38]** When you're f***ing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** We got to cut that.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** We can't use catchphrases like that.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** That's copyrighted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Yeah, that is copyright.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Just bleep it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** All right.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:50]** Last in our intros was Nico O'Riott.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** before he was Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Yeah, Quickfire.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** You set the record straight on that one.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Slow shot.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:06]** In short, Nico got voted out of his company by his own mother on a trumped-up drug charge.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:13]** His best friend, mentor, and bodyguard was assassinated, and Nico is on the run.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** What I am exploring with Nico Orion is...

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:27]** What happens to someone who has gotten a silver spoon his entire life and all of a sudden starts meeting adversity?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** How do people usually respond to that?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** How do they come out on the other side of that?

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:40]** And how does it shape their outlook and their mindset?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:40 - 00:36:04]** yeah yeah yeah well there's there's also uh it's not really mentioned in your intro but it definitely comes up later on is that your father has been out of the scene for a year correct and there's something definitely you know cued into that aspect of it so we'll explore that a little later too indeed yeah indeed yeah there's a lot to discover for nico for sure a lot to unpack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:10]** So when you guys... Let's combine a couple of things just in the interest of time.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** The first two things we have on our agenda here.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:17]** Just like the intro fight in the docking bay and that whole scene.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** And then you guys boarding and then the first fight with the asteroid lights.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** And that's a lot to talk through.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** But was there anything about that?

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** What were your thoughts about that?

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:33]** How did it feel to suddenly be getting on board and then you're tasked with fighting not only some sort of...

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:56]** criminal fugitive you don't really know about magua and then also dealing with this uh this box and these asteroid lights from another passenger even now i have a tough time going back and listening back and understanding where the battle lines are i don't know who's friend or foe yet uh or if we even had friends or foes it like this whole thing is uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** It's a big mystery.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:13]** Right now, that first fight with that Kasathan coming up, I don't know if that was one of the remaining crew members just making a desperate attempt to try to escape or take revenge for a lost crew member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** I didn't think of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** Maybe he was trying to warn us.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Did we kill a hero from the very start?

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** Someone trying to do a heroic deed?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** What I thought after re-listening...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** But it was attacking LaRue, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Yeah.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:38]** What if she's our helpful jailer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:46]** That or what if the person thought that Lozu had been shapeshifted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:59]** So here's, here's the thing that, and I mean, like we're, again, we're on episode 29 at this point where, you know, um, and we finished book one and hopefully if you're listening to this, you've listened to all of that.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** The end of book one is just mind boggling.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:11]** And that has me as a player questioning everything that's happened to us since then, including what happens on the docks.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:16]** I'm trying to analyze the docks itself.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** Is that just a simulation of some sort?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** Or did we actually step onto the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:46]** the ship was taken uh we will talk about this all later but like i'm just saying i'm very uncertain about this initial fight and you guys are talking about who's good and who's bad like uh yeah i've got no concept but i was trying to think about it because i was thinking that because of the uh the the makeup of the ship is um unreal it's something of like

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** The Star Dream.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Yeah, the Star Dream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Yeah, and we can talk about it too when we get to that last part.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:56]** I can go over a bit more, again, the text if you want to listen to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:00]** I feel like we definitely took the blue pill and we're just awakening to the Matrix right now.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** That's kind of where I'm at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:09]** One thing I do want to highlight is that I think I liked that you said, Nick, that you didn't know who's good and who's bad.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:16]** Because there were also times where in episode one, you hear, you know, like Agent LaRue talking to Algiata.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:23]** You see like their perception checks of Trostenec talking to Algiata, right?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:26]** They're like, you see, what's her name?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Jin Chiroga.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Yeah.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:32]** Having some sort of thing with Algiata when you listen back to episode one.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** And it's like, at the time, you don't know.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** You don't know the significance of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Oh, that was something Nick said in one of our chats.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** It was like, what if Ginger Roga is another hero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** Well, let's get there when we get there.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Is there anything else about the docking bay?

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** It feels like we're kind of moving on from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** Well, I was just trying to think back.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:53]** On that docking bay, who then follows us onto the ship?

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** We do see Captain Rameem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** Captain Rameem comes out and says, what's going on with my passengers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Yeah.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:04]** But was that Captain Rameem or was that already dead Captain Rameem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Captain Rameem is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Well, they should know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** I hope that they wouldn't know that.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** I mean, I'm not going to say anything because I'm curious what you guys think.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:22]** And I think at the time we went over it, but I don't want to say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:38]** Well, I mean, later on, um, at some point, uh, we talked to the imposters and they, and we find out that they had been living as these characters much earlier on, um, including at the docks.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:46]** So it's, we can assume that the Captain Ramim that, that comes out of that ship during this combat or right after this combat, um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:46 - 00:41:09]** was the imposter already the astrazone because but then here's my question to follow up why let anybody on the passenger ship anyway and then you tied that into what happened at the end like maybe where did where's the where's where does the simulation begin and where does it end like who's real who isn't and what the hell is going on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** All right.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** So let's just skip past this.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:21]** Understand that we as players have no idea where the lines start to get blurry because they definitely get blurry at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:26]** It's also tougher to view all these events now with this new lens that you have.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** But that's why we're doing this right now.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:33]** Because you, the listener, are probably also like, I just heard this episode and now I just want to have...

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:40]** some more perspective because that's exactly what we're doing here is that you guys are getting the perspective now you're diving in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:46]** When you go back and you listen to these episodes, not saying you have to, but like, if you do just listen closer.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:55]** Cause it's, and again, talking about plot armor and like the arguments that we've had, like I will, I will message John right after we record and be like, what kind of bullshit?

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** You never told us this, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:03]** And then John will just send me a text later on saying, go back and listen to episode three at this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:10]** And I'll hear it and be like, cause, cause he's, John's thought all of this through twice over and like,

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** I'm mostly good at that.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** A couple times I miss it.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** We can talk about that.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:21]** But for the most part, I do my best to make sure everything's above board and makes sense, right?

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** It's all about continuity.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:26]** So anything with that whole encounter with the asteroid lice.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** You first meet Keefe.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** They're friendly.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** You first meet Professor Benjam.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:38]** And then, to be honest, bumping into the next thing where you're cleaning up and then you guys...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:38 - 00:43:01]** overhear the conversation between trostenac and algiata that that that whole section any thoughts about that well and this and this quite came up during that episode is what was the intention of the lice in the first place and why why did this professor supposedly professor have the lice container wait who asked who wait hold on who asked us to clean that up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** I think it was just circumstance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:14]** I mean... Yes, I think Song came out and said that they needed to get this whole galley set up for food.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** And I think we offered to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** I think Rick was like, I'll take care of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Yeah, and then Song was like, can you guys help real quick?

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Like, the incinerator's just... Or no, Keeve.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Keeve, sorry, was like, can you help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** How exactly did they get released again?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** I'm trying to remember the last...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:35]** They got released because Professor Benjamin was showing you the cube and being like, look, there are these little tiny bugs in there.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:41]** Apparently, it shrinks things into this tiny cube and then handed it to Keeve.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** And then Keeve was like, actually, Professor, I don't know quite about that.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:48]** And the professor got a little flustered and was like,

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** was like, I don't really know.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** Like, Keeve was implying that he got kind of duped here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** That they weren't actually giant lice.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Right.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** And then, you know, fleas inside of a thing.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** And then what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** I'll show you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** No, they dropped it.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** And when it broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Well, I'll say this.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:12]** I'm not going to confirm or deny, but I'm just going to say in general, it was written as like Professor Benjam kind of reaches over to take it and then it falls.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Or Keith threw it on the floor and broke it.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Well, choose that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Or Benjam knew what the hell he was doing.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** I mean, he was hiding the fact.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:29]** The obvious thing for here's Nico at this point is that last episode, he was a damn pirate.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** So then like, I mean, I don't know.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** He's up to no good.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Oh, he's a Pokemon master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** I choose you, Astro Lice.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Silly me.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** He's a Pokemon master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:44]** He had just come from beating the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** He's a pirate Pokemon master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Oh, man.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** He just died right after he made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** But yeah, straight off of Team Rocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:52]** I don't know.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** I don't buy his story necessarily.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Oh, the pirate thing, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** That'll come up much later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Yeah, it will.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:04]** Well, it was actually around this time between you guys over here in the conversation when you came back.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** That's when Hears and Nico were first singing Take It or Leave It.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** That's when you guys were kind of bonding over that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** I was mad about that.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Why are you mad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** You were mad about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** I was so confused.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** I was like, why are you two singing?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** How do you know each other?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Yeah.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:29]** So again, just for the listeners, when you're listening to that episode, Dr. OK, Will, and Kevin, Rick, the four of us, because there's only two of us anyways, the two of our players went off separately.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:33]** And we actually made Kelly and Nick take off their headphones.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** So they could not hear what we were doing during that case.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:44]** And then when we got back, the two of them were singing the song together in unison.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** And I had no idea.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** When did you guys plan that?

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Is this something you guys have been working on?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Or was that while we were gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** While we were gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Oh, no.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** So we'd had that plan.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** Kelly, I think we'd had that plan for like six weeks.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** And then we were just waiting for the right time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** And that worked.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** That was the right time.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** That was the right time.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** Yep.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** And there's more where that came from.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** There's more where that came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** So it's good.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** And so for the listener, yeah, like...

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:17]** As players, we had no idea what was going on and the connection that those two characters had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Yeah.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:25]** And I definitely think to any GMs out there or players, if you have a cool idea, one, let your GM know.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Or two, try and rope in another player.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** Try and be like, hey, I have this cool idea.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** Do you want to work on it with me?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** And then we can surprise the other players.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** Because then it just helps make it all, helps bring it all together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:40]** And it definitely changes the team dynamic.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Yeah.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:46]** Because at that point, we're just four strangers, and we're trying to find a reason to be united.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Yeah.

**[00:46:47 - 00:47:04]** And actually, it was kind of great, too, because for a minute in the early episodes, I feel like, it made Rick and Dr. Okay sort of the rational... We have this secret together that we have to figure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:17]** And you guys bonded over your, like being together in your own way, which was cool too, which like we created a dynamic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Yeah.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:24]** It was, you know, but no, I couldn't agree with John more.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:32]** And I think it's one of the biggest things that I've learned during this playthrough is just involving your fellow players and their storyline.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:42]** So I think one of the biggest traps and I fall into this trap in our D and D game, I think a lot of times, and it's like hashtag paladin moment, but yeah,

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:52]** You try to make yourself the central hero, and you're just one person amongst the party, and you're just trying to figure out your character's crap amongst everything else that's going on.

**[00:47:53 - 00:48:00]** And you try to involve your fellow castmates as much as possible to figure that out.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:05]** The more you do that, the more interesting the story gets, the more kind of...

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:29]** WTF moments you find as you play through and that's where it really gets fun and interesting because I can tell you one thing like I did not expect John to make Keeve sing take her to leave it like that was like what and it shocked Kelly yeah it shocked Kelly more than it shocked me but it still shocked me I was like whoa

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** I didn't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Professor Benjamin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** No, sorry.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** So that's Professor Benjamin.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** And we haven't talked about this yet because that comes much later on.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:42]** Because I was... Again, and this is the player separation.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:47]** Will and I still don't know what your guys' connection is to that song.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:53]** And so when the song came up, it was actually Professor Benjamin told me as Rick that song.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** And I shouted it back down the hallway and...

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** I didn't know what he was saying.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** And then you guys were like, oh, wait a minute.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** And I was like, damn it, this is another pirate.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** So I mean, I love it.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** I love the dynamic that's coming from that.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:15]** And I think something that I've seen in a lot of like chats on your Twitter and whatever is the debate of like whether or not to play a low level character.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:23]** And I think that's one of the best things about playing one of the best arguments about playing a low level character, like level one is that the game is not developed enough.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Like it's not all combat yet.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** It's not all skill.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** It is, it is character development.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:33]** And that's something that, you know, I hope as listeners that you guys are appreciating that because as players, that's what we appreciate.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** And,

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:42]** And that's what we're learning from ourselves and from each other of who we are as our character and then who is our character in this scheme of things.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** Yep.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** And the scheme of things on this damn ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Speaking of scheme of things, yeah.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:54]** I mean, I think it was that conversation where you first were like, hold on.

**[00:49:54 - 00:50:00]** There's something more than just the first docking bay incident and then the asteroid lights.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** There's, like, some larger structure here.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** And then when you all wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I didn't have that clue.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** I didn't have that idea yet.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:12]** Rick was still in the mindset of, like, these are two, like, disconnected situations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** And now we're going back and thinking about it.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Like, wait, are they connected?

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** You know, are these all on purpose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:25]** I feel like we should have a drop for Bohemian Rhapsody right now.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** Is this the real life or is this just fantasy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:37]** So after the astral lice, Dr. Roque and Rick went down to help move the lice bodies into the incinerator with Keeve.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Yeah.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** And then Keeve left us.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** And on the way back, we overheard Algiata and Trostenec the Vesk.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** So Algiata is the ship's security officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:53]** which we have not seen at this point, or we were introduced to her at one point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** We saw her outside the docking bay, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Okay.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** She was checking people in.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** Okay, but what did she do during that docking bay fight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Anything?

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** She shot.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** She was attacking Magwa.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:10]** And there was an incident, like I said in the beginning, where she looked at Trostenec, and there was a little thing with Trostenec.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Then there was something else with Jin Chiroga.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:17]** And then there was also, she talked to Agent LaRue.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:48]** yeah so yeah she was part of episode one she was there the conversation that we heard between Trostnik uh and and Aljana Will do you want to say what happened I don't remember like I mean it was pretty much just that yeah good she basically yeah uh basically it was like we'll have to stick to the plan and then they were like well if we stick to the plan this might happen and then they saw you and they're like okay cool hold on hold on yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** They were clearly being shady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Very shady.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Very shady.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:59]** And this is the ship's security officer doing that.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** And that was very incredibly creepy.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:11]** And in the meantime, Nick and Kelly were both back at the lounge, the cruise quarters, or the galley or whatever you want to call it.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Cruise mess.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** Having some drinks and having a good time and singing their sea shanties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Yep.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Yep.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:29]** So after that whole fun shenanigans, you guys fall asleep and then you wake up.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:36]** And there's some stuff going down in the hallway with Jinchiroga and the goblins.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** And I think you had previously seen them be hella messy in the galley the night before.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** And they just didn't clean anything up.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:49]** And that's why Song is in the hallway being like, hold on, you can't come in here if you're going to be that messy again.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** And they're about to have an altercation.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** And you guys come out.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:58]** And then that's when Lozu kind of comes up and says like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Have you guys seen Algiata?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** Here's my thing about Gingeroga.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** Here's my whole thing about Gingeroga in general.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:22]** If Gingeroga and the New Bloods were in the galley, albeit being rowdy, why on earth would they be part of the original pirate crew to take over the ship?

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** They didn't act until after the power went out.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** In which case...

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** They weren't any different from us in their course of action.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:35]** They just had less seemly characters in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:43]** You're saying they had opportunity and so they saw it, but they could also have been a helpful distraction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** It was either one or the other or option three, maybe.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** They were like, okay, we have a job to do.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** This ship is off course.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Something's going on.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** We're taking control of the bridge and we're going to take the ship wherever we need to go.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** So you're saying that should have happened sooner?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:11]** I'm saying that Gingeroga and the New Bloods were acting as basically rowdy mercenaries that didn't give a crap.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:20]** And then when danger was presented upon them, they did what mercenaries did, took control of the situation and intended to rectify what was going on.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** They probably would have demanded a healthy fee from everybody else.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** Not much different from pirates, but...

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** I mean, they weren't much different in their course of action.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:36]** They didn't take action until after danger had been thrust upon the whole occupants of the quote-unquote ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** So... I'm not super confused at all, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I get what you're saying.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** It's hard to know, though.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** I mean, if whoever's planning this out is masterful enough, like...

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** It could have been a distraction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** It could have been.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** I just don't see it, man.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** I think they were a separate player entirely.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** I think we had the pirates taking over the ship.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** I think we had the original crewmates.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** I think we had the fake crewmates that were part of the pirates.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:16]** And then I think we have us and then Gingeroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** Actually, I was just going to say, I agree with you.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:24]** Because there's no reason to be suicidal anyway, otherwise.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Yeah.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** It makes sense that someone might be trying to stop this from going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:36]** But at the same time, you got to think – you talk about the original crew, the imposter crew.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:41]** We'll talk about all this later, but Lozu is a part of the quote-unquote original crew.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:50]** And actually, this happens sooner than later, but she starts acting funny where she goes blank and –

**[00:55:50 - 00:56:15]** so if you're talking about like greater scheme of things who knows where that again like where is that line drawn like are all of these players are we the only four on this ship that are actual people yeah right and exactly and to follow that up kev the i find even the name of the ship the star dream very suspect almost as though it's a name of a program much less of a ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:19]** Well, to be clear, the name of the ship you got on is the Chimera.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:23]** The name of the panel that you saw in the hallway is Star Dream 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** Which is what the goblins were looking for.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:33]** Because we find later on, and this is skipping ahead, but we find their map of locations that they were trying to find.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:38]** And all the locations they were trying to find were places where we found Star Dream indicators.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** Am I wrong?

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** I don't remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Who are you asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** That's nothing to John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** I'm going to hard pass on that one.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** I'm going to hard pass on that one.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** Yeah.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Here's a question.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:05]** How did it feel, the whole encounter with once you find out that Algiata is missing and the power goes out and you're like, shit, we're stranded in the drift.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** And then Professor Benjamin's like, hang on, come here.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** How did that happen?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** How was that?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:18]** Because I think that's the first time that you also are like, OK, there's some like now we have multiple layers here.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** And yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Were there any specific thoughts on that?

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Do you feel good about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:29]** Kelly, what were your thoughts on that situation when the professor told us about the relic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** All right.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Hold on one more.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Please repeat it.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** I was typing something in the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Sorry.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:45]** After the lights went out, what were your thoughts when Professor Benjamin pulled us into the room and talked to us individually?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:48]** When he was talking about the existence of the relic and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** And he asked us to go find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:55]** Well, I mean, are you asking, like, was here's, like, hell yeah?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** Because, yeah, he was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** It is like, hell yeah.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** I'll say this.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** I'll say that I think... Go ahead, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:10]** Sorry if I didn't understand the question, but yeah, that's... I mean, here's as excited and... I mean... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:20]** The prospect of a relic is a curiosity for anyone, frankly, even a scientist such as myself, I would imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** So we... Yeah, hold on.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** All right.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** Anyway.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** All right.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Got it.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Cool.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:32]** So basically, what's going through Here's head with the relic in general is, one, relics are awesome.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:39]** And Here's does like to acquire lots of cool things, being a pirate and just liking money and cool things in general.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:47]** But also, he thinks that this might be related potentially to what his friend gave him, of course.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** So this could be his ticket back in.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:55]** I'll say that – and we can cut this if you want, Nick.

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:06]** But the reason why this episode is called Plot Armor is because Nick had asked a bunch of questions of Professor Benjam and was like, tell me everything you know.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** And Professor Benjam didn't.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** And so on one hand, I think –

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:26]** Uh, this is some insight from some GM insight in that, like this book, there are moments where like, there's not plot armor, uh, but there are just things that like, as a GM, like you'd have to get comfortable with.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** And this was just one of those moments.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:33]** And, uh, if you're going to GM it, message me privately and we'll talk about it.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:43]** But I think overall, I could have maybe done a little bit of a better job giving you guys because I kind of played it a little bit like, all right, is anybody going to help?

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** No.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** OK, cool.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** I think I could have maybe done a couple of things to ease that transition a bit better.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:55]** But overall, I think it was interesting because this was the first time where you guys were like, tell me something and you just hit a wall.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** You're like, I can't get any more information here.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** It was frustrating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** It was very frustrating.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:06]** I remember I was rolling really high on all my diplomacy checks.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:10]** I was asking good questions and I was just getting stonewalled.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:20]** And I was just like, it came to the point where I felt very specifically, John doesn't want us to know this right now because it will reveal too much of the story.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:24]** This person, this moment has plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** Which, I mean, that's technically not the definition of plot armor, though.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:34]** Plot armor is usually when something is nerfed for that reason.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** Yeah.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:39]** Where this encounter was just not ever meant to go that far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:44]** This person's responses were armored.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** We're what, Nick?

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Armored.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** We're armored.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:57]** You know, this person, Professor Benjam, one, you guys never followed up, and we'll talk about this later.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** They all died before we got back to him.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:29]** so yeah hey I'm just saying but the point is that like there are plenty of things that could have explained a lot and there are still things what I like about this AP as a whole and about this book too is that there are things that are just not answered yet and I think in time they're all astrozoans we'll find the real Professor Benjamin later on I think it's too linear it's too linear for this

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:59]** bunch of malarkey if you ask me but okay yeah it's uh once once we get to that point and i can say what's up then i think it'll make a lot more sense and i think you'll see that there was nothing there where i was like you shouldn't be there because as a gm you should never have something like it's your story in the sense that like i should never keep you from it and i really have tried to not intentionally do that like there would have been nothing wrong and even if you saw some of the mistakes that i made you'd be like

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:04]** oh, that's not technically what the book says, but, like, this happened, and then things just go on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** I mean, I understand that.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** I really do.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:11]** It felt in that moment that that's where it was, and I get it.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** Yeah.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:19]** Also, this is coming from the same person that called pirates from the very beginning when the power went out.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** That's true.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** You said pirates.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:26]** To say that this is just everybody's going to be an astrozoan, like,

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:35]** The only way I could see that happening, Kevin, is if this whole ship, this whole thing is a program run by astrozoans and some of them are guinea pigs.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** That's what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** That would be the only way I can see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:45]** Well, let's not skip too far ahead, but I think the pirates were a part of this whole scheme.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** And I'll give you my reasons for that later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:48 - 01:03:01]** So back to... Can I say, Nick, I apologize as a DM for not making the transition from you feeling like it's protected material, which it was not, to not be that way.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** That's all that I have to say about that.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Because that's the one thing that I could have changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:08]** John, when you're dealing with that, do you...

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:33]** like do you just set their like their check or not their check do you just set like do we just have to roll something incredible in order to get that information or are there things that are just truly impenetrable like from the story like where it's like no matter how high you roll i'm not going to reveal this or something like that no i'm always gonna and i think this is a good thing to do as a gm there are always at least three different ways that you can find out some sort of clue


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:38]** And I always try and go out almost down to the level of every room that you're in or every encounter.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** There are some potential clues about something.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:47]** And I know that overall there could be unrelated clues that I need to pull in because you guys just didn't ask that.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** You didn't roll high enough.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:52]** And there were times, I think, Nick, where you rolled and I told you you were off.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:59]** But I'm never going to lock something behind one dice DC wall.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** I'm never going to do that.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:13]** If there's a chance to find it again, and I feel it's important for you guys to know, or frankly, just to know in general, because I don't know how you guys are interpreting it, I'm going to try and make all that information available to you.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:19]** I will say that part of the reason why you guys didn't find out more was because you never went back to talk to Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Which I regret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]** That's also partly because of what, sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** I just say I regret it.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** We never really had the opportunity.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** Oh yeah, that's true too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:32]** You didn't have the opportunity, but you could have also decided to.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** Like you never also went to check on Keefe.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** We didn't have time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** We never had time.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** So, and rolling back into the story where we were.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:45]** So after that, Professor Bidrum said, please go find the relic and protect it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:50]** Technically, Professor Benjamin said, please find out why Algiata is disappeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:50]** That's right.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** Professor Benjamin said, find out.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]** But then he mentioned the relic and the pirates in the group were like, ooh, relic money.

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:04]** And so we went in search of this relic, which we were told was in the cargo bay.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:07]** This is another point that came up several times.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:10]** This is a sticky issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** Did we mention one or two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** Spoiler.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:14]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** No, no.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Well, okay.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:23]** So we went on, I think all four of us went on believing there was only one cargo bay for the next 25 episodes.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:30]** And when it finally broke down that there is a second cargo bay where the relic actually was, I went back and listened to the early episodes.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:34]** And sure enough, John did tell us.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:36]** the starboard cargo bay.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** Very good.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:38]** And that there are two cargo bays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** Implying that there's a poor cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** He mumbles it.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:44]** He mumbles it as we're walking away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Which mumbles it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:50]** I did not mean to mumble it.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** There's a poor cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** There's a poor cargo bay.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:26]** like i said i genuinely am not trying to keep it from you if you guys had gone into that cargo bay i'm not going to say what would have happened but it would not have been an issue like like if i could just show you that there would have been no reason to do it then you would understand but yeah i'm not trying to keep anything behind a wall that's probably honestly it's probably just like i had a bunch of things in my head and then i'm like oh i should like let me clarify that for them and then move on so that's just a genuine song who actually says the starboard cargo bay is this way


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:29]** during episode seven or something like that.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** Six or seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** It was insane.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** That's my bad.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:36]** Again, I think those two things of the whole thing are what I apologize the most for.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:39]** The Professor Benjamin thing and the cargo bay thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** But that being said, we were told to go to the cargo bay.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** We go to the cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** Starboard cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** The cargo bay.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Starboard.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** The cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** The cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** The starboard cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:55]** We're going to get you a t-shirt, John, that just says Starboard Cargo Bay.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** I would love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** That would be great.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** That would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:03]** The GM is stored in the Starboard Cargo Bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:17]** In that cargo bay, the only cargo bay, we find Trusnack on the ground, and we find a robot, a giant non-killer robot, a Hugabot.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:22]** And it attacks us, and we attack back, and we defeat it.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:29]** And then we proceed to interrogate Trostnik, who was unconscious on the ground in that room.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:33]** And this is another contingency that Jon had with us.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:43]** As players, we decided to handcuff and contain Tristanek for being suspicious in one of the cargo boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:48]** I think that is ultimately totally fine.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** I thought it was...

**[01:07:49 - 01:08:00]** I'm sorry that I said anything, but at the end of the day, I think the reaction that Lozu then has in the subsequent episode, which is like, you were just judge, jury, and executioner in a way.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:13]** Just, I need you to be able to, like, exhibit a little more discretion when you do that, because Shostak is another passenger, and I get that, and I appreciate it, and I'm glad you're okay, but you need to just cool it a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** Since this is the plot armor episode, we can talk about it.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** Is that, like...

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:18]** Rick was right in being suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]** Yes.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Now that you know that.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** Now that you know that, yes.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:27]** But Kev, here's where I think we took a little bit too much from our D&D game.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:34]** In our D&D game, we are licensed to do whatever we think is necessary to rectify the situation.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** No one invited us to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** Yeah, but who gives a damn?

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:43]** I'm looking out for myself and my party way more than the people who can't even run a damn ship.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** We got attacked multiple times at that point.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Screw them.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:49]** I don't want to get attacked again, ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]** As a character, I agree with you.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:56]** As a player, there was a fine difference here, and I think Jon did a good job reacting as an NPC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** The NPC reaction was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** I'll say...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:20]** I'll say that I don't fully agree with the NPC response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Citizens arrest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:26]** And here's my thing with, so like, and I'm not criticizing John, because I know you have a ton on your mind when you're doing these kind of things.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:41]** But I do think Lozu, if this were happening on an actual cruise ship, if there were, you know, passengers acting crazy and other passengers subdued them and locked them into like a closet or something, the first response wouldn't be, why did you lock them in the closet?

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** It would be, wait, you said, what did they do to us?

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** And then treat everybody accordingly.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:48]** That's also fair.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:57]** Maybe it could have been, maybe it was more so that you were talking to Trostenec and Trostenec never attacked you.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** The robot attacked you.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:01]** And then you were like, Trostenec sicked the robot on us.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:03]** But Trostenec was like, I didn't sick the robot on you.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:04]** I came in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** And that's my question is, he's suspicious.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** She didn't have that in her mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:11]** I thought that you guys had told her that, but maybe you didn't.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** That's fine.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:19]** But the question is, how do you feel now about Trostenec's story, now knowing that Trostenec is an astral zone?

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:23]** What Trostenec said, what do you think actually happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:33]** What I feel, now looking back on that part, I feel like Trostenek was one of the few actual real people left in that simulation.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:34]** Whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:37]** No, he was an astrozoan the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** He was an astrozoan the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:38]** No, no, no.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** We knew that.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:42]** Well, we knew that he had been taken over by an astrozoan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:49]** Yes, he'd been taken over by an Astrozoan at some point before the ship even left the dock.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:58]** Because we later find the letter that indicates that Trusnick is a real Vesk, and he has a family, and that's what that letter represents.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:04]** But the Astrozoan that's taken over probably doesn't know that kind of stuff, or doesn't care.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:09]** What I think happened with the robot is that the Astrozoan Trusnick...

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:15]** was trying to activate the robot for whatever reason, and it backfired, and that's why it knocked him unconscious.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** You waiting on me to confirm or deny that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:20]** No, I think he's waiting for that.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** I think he's waiting for it to settle.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:24]** Well, think about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:29]** I think the astrozoan staged it in order to get closer to the relic somehow.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:44]** To either sick the robot out on us and maybe the rest of the ship in order to secure the relic or some other...

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:48]** fiendish plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:48]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:59]** go ahead, John, tell us what you, what you're going to, what you're able to tell us without, I will say that Trostenec's motivations, knowing now that, you know, that Trostenec, uh, before boarding, right?

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:05]** Like the Trostenec that you saw on board, like was like more than likely an Astrozoan, right?

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:07]** Because that was confirmed by the Astrozoans later, right?

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:16]** Cause they talked about the plans they had previously before arriving at legacy station and before meeting with you guys in flight, then are in the stranded in the drift.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:17]** Um,

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:34]** Trostenec's plan going in there was to set up, as Will said, to stage it so then that way it looked like he was being attacked by the droid because he wanted to pull attention from anything having to do.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:37]** And so then he was like, maybe Algiata did it and sabotaged my own droid.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:43]** Maybe that was something that totally kind of... It was definitely not my fault that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:58]** right was that a lie like that he constructed what do you mean is that a lie that he constructed like was he actually incapacitated nevermind he was incapacitated like he was definitely yes he was actually incapacitated he took something went awry


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** Yeah.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:01]** Yeah.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:05]** Or, well, I'll say that his point was to set it up and to be staged.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** So then that way that could happen.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** And then he was knocked unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** He's really committed.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:17]** Really, really, really committed, but we were still frustrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** What was your frustration?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:20]** I forget my question here.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:24]** I'm just, there's just, we just don't know.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** We don't know anything.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** Um,

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** We just don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:29]** Question.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:32]** What do you guys think about everything that happened afterwards?

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:37]** You saw Lozu in the hallway and Lozu was standing completely still.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** And then you go up.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:43]** You kind of get the A-OK to go up to Algiata's room and to go check on Keeve.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** And you go up to Algiata's room.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]** And along the way, you find that panel.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** That's the Stargame 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:51]** Knowing what we know now...

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:58]** I feel like, and this kind of links back to the last episode where Lozo just collapsed for no reason.

**[01:13:59 - 01:13:59]** Lifeless.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:06]** It kind of seemed like whatever program or being or construct

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:17]** that was inside that ship with us hadn't received orders or was receiving new programming to give us something.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** We were set up.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** It was glitching out.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** We were set up with that key card.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:25]** And what's more, we were set up to go to Algiata's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:27]** Those two things we know.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:35]** Lozu standing perfectly still in that hallway was our first indication of a faulty program.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:41]** That whatever's going on in this ship, whoever is running this game on us, that was the first time we saw a glitch.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:45]** But that's not the last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:51]** And so, yeah, Lozu at the end freezes and dies in the same manner.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:53]** She just stops functioning, essentially.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:53]** It turns off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** Nick, I can say that.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:59]** When you said that you were set up with a key card, what do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:01]** We were set up to go to Algiana's room.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:06]** Like, it's like, oh, gosh, what's the best way to say it?

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:09]** Lozu the program.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:13]** Yeah, I think that's what we're going to stick with for now because it's the best.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:15]** It's like very Westworld.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** Yeah.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:24]** Lozu the program didn't know what was going to happen, but whoever's running this maze knew what was going to happen.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:32]** So we were given the card with the game master's expectation that we opened that door and we were going to get shot.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** Specifically me.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:34]** I was going to get shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:37]** It's funny because John's the one running the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** John's in that zone, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:43]** That's it.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:44]** Shoot him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:45 - 01:16:13]** I think the biggest thing is that I like I said with the clues and you asked earlier Kelly and I said I'm never going to put a clue behind a wall I'm also never going to put an opportunity behind something else so anytime you guys receive something like that it's like it's just another way for me to let you guys know like hey you have a lot of opportunities here you have a lot of things that you can do whatever you guys want to do do it

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:16]** But here's another thing to give you another opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:19]** So one opportunity we would have had at this point.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:23]** So Lozu glitches out.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:27]** She gives us the key card after a pretty heated argument between us and the GM.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:32]** And then after that, we head straight to Algiata's room.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:37]** This is one of those opportunities we had to go talk to Professor Benjamin O'Keefe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:38]** Professor Benjamin.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:38]** Yeah.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:41]** So do you want to know more about that?

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:42]** Cause I feel like tell us.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:42]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:45]** So I'll tell you, let me start with Keeve.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:49]** So you guys did have an opportunity to go help keep out with the engines.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:58]** And I can just give you a peek and to say that one of the things that had happened without getting into Keeve's responsibility, uh,

**[01:16:58 - 01:17:08]** Then going to help with the engines, the Astrozoans, right, might have been part of the reason why the engines were stranded, right?

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:12]** That was the whole thing why their ship met up with you in the drift, right?

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:16]** That's why they boarded was because your ship was now stranded.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:21]** So one of the things that happened was that they sabotaged part of the engines.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:27]** And as part of it, they sabotaged some of the things that Keeve was working on.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:44]** So one of the things that would have happened is that if you had gone to work and help Keeve out, there would have been something that happened that would have been like an incident, like a misfire, like some fire shoots out and stuff that would have caused you guys to wonder, oh, like, did Keeve just try and kill us?

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:45]** Yeah.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:46]** Right.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:57]** Because it's part of the thing that the Astrozoans want because they stranded the ship and then they've set these things because they want to make sure that the ship stays stranded so they can board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:58]** Okay.

**[01:17:58 - 01:18:05]** So no matter what, though, I think we're all of the mind here that we were inside of a glitchy program.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:12]** So if that's the lens we're viewing it at, then we need to count all the glitches and all the last words of the Astrozoans.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:20]** And then those are really the only real clues that we have to go and operate it off of if we're playing detective on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:24]** Let me put this.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:26]** I'm trying to think of saying the best thing.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:29]** How do I say this?

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:38]** I think this one thing that I say, because I'm trying to be very hesitant with how much I say, because, again, I like the mystery and the story is important.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:38]** What?

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:39]** Because we're still playing.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** Yeah, because we're still playing.

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:42]** You guys are still going through it.

**[01:18:43 - 01:19:00]** I'll say this one last thing, which is probably the biggest thing that I'll say in this episode, which is just that, because I'm not going to say too much more about Professor Benjamin and what happened and everything, other than the fact that you found that picture of him and somebody who looked like Algiata in Algiata's room, right?

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:04]** You never got a chance to ask him about that picture, right?

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:06]** And say what's going on with that picture.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:17]** And I can just say in general that that picture was part of the reason why he was asking you to ask after Algiata because he had a personal connection to Algiata.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:21]** And I won't go into anything else too much more, but this is kind of water.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:24]** It's water under the bridge because you didn't get a chance to ask him.

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:25]** But that's part of his motivation.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:34]** But I encourage you to maybe include in your thinking because now you're taking inventory of the glitches, as Nick said.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:37]** You're taking inventory of what the astrozoan said.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:40]** You're taking inventory of like, well, what was real and what wasn't real.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:54]** And I'll just give you one little thing, which is to say, you should think about the way that professor Benjamin responded in your first encounter with him in his room, where he asked you to go look after Algiata.

**[01:19:54 - 01:20:01]** You should start to reframe that as less of a, like, I wouldn't tell you stuff and you should reframe it more as a glitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:05]** And this spring says information wasn't there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:07]** That's all I'm going to say.

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:13]** But there was stuff that I had prepared in case you guys wanted to delve more into that than just talking or whatever.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:19]** It's like there was an opportunity for you there, and then you never got a chance to go talk back with him.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:24]** So I had prepared some other stuff because I said, well, you didn't get a chance to really fully go there.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:27]** So I said, well, if you talk to him again, you will have a chance to fully go there.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:33]** So I'm giving you that because I want you guys to start to reframe a little bit some of the things without taking away the enjoyment of playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:36]** Plot armor's got plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** Plot armor really isn't plot armor here.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:39]** That's what it is.

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:42]** John has to protect the plot.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:46]** Yeah, there are just other things that have still yet to happen.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:50]** And like I said, things have continuity in this AP.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** Everything carries forward.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:55]** So that's how I'm viewing telling you things.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:59]** It's because I'm like, when I tell you things, it's because they have connections forward.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:01]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:06]** Right after that weirdness with Lozu, we head up to Al Giada's room.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:09]** And on the way there, Dr. O.K.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:11]** notices the Star Dream panel.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:16]** That's the first indication that we got that the ship that we're on is not necessarily the ship we think it is.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:26]** And Nick actually called it out and said the Chimera is a mythological creature that consumes other creatures and takes on characteristics of the creatures they consume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:29]** I don't think I said that, but if you want to give me credit for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:34]** I'm pretty sure it was you that during that episode, you were like, the ship's called the Chimera.

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** And then John was like, yeah.

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:42]** But yeah, so we know then that the Star Dream, that this ship used to be the Star Dream.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:48]** We did some checks on it, that the Star Dream was a ship that existed, but it disappeared 30 years ago or something.

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:53]** And then we get to Al Jada's room.

**[01:21:53 - 01:21:58]** And when we open that door, Nick gets shot from a cryo rifle.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:01]** That was cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:03]** That was cold.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:04]** That was very cold.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:05]** That was cold.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:11]** Before we go on, real thing, do you guys want a little cool little connection Easter egg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:12]** Yeah.

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:13]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:13]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:15]** Okay.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:16]** Roll a d20.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:18]** One person roll one d20.

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:19]** I got this one.

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:20]** Okay.

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:21]** Will's got it.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** Will's got it.

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:23]** Will has got it.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:25]** If you get above 10, I'm going to tell you.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:26]** If you get below, I'm not going to tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:27]** Oh, man.

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:28]** Look at this thing.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:30]** Take your background off so I can see this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:33]** It's a tiny little gray skull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:36]** Oh, I thought it was a chunk D20.

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:37]** A D20 this big.

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:41]** Oh, okay.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** That's cool.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:42]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:43]** I love it.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:44]** Roll it.

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:47]** What do you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:47]** 15.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:48]** Yes.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:49]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:51]** Good, good.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:51]** Okay.

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:53]** I'll frame it this way.

**[01:22:55 - 01:23:05]** You should think about when you go back and listen to episode one, if you go back and listen to it, listeners included, there are certain –

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:11]** decorations in the docking bay that are important to listen to.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:11]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:15]** You're talking about, like, in the very beginning in your intro when you're just describing the scene?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:15]** Yeah.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:17]** What the F, John?

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:20]** Those will play a part in things we have just recently talked about.

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]** What the F, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:22]** That's awesome.

**[01:23:22 - 01:23:27]** I think I know what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:27]** Okay.

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:30]** So, you guys, Nick got shot.

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:31]** Nick got shot.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:32]** Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:34]** With this cool thing.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:38]** Then you guys find, I think, your first treasure trove of clues in Algiata's room.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:39]** You find the ledger.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:42]** Well, first we fight with Grath for no reason.

**[01:23:42 - 01:23:43]** No, that was afterwards.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:44]** That was me.

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:45]** That was me.

**[01:23:45 - 01:23:45]** That was afterwards.

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:56]** And that was after you find the ledger, the picture, and Algiata's data pad where you realize that she possibly had some sort of scheme where Captain Rameem was going to be.

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:03]** was whose life was in danger upon return to the packed worlds and no reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:04]** And I will.

**[01:24:04 - 01:24:10]** And just my peek behind a little prologue for book two for Nico is, was that for no reason?

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:12]** Uh, when he got mad at graph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:14]** Yep.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:14]** Yep.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:16]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:16]** That's fair.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:17]** Yeah.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:17]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:21]** Well, that's, and here's another question without like the Algiata led ledger.

**[01:24:22 - 01:24:26]** Um, was that Algiata that had an issue with Rameem?


## Speaker_0

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:27]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:36]** Because we know now that Algiada has been a plant, an astrozoan for at least this trip.

**[01:24:37 - 01:24:39]** And then Captain Marimene, we didn't really get to talk to.

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:40]** We'll talk about that later.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:49]** So that battle between the two of them, this whole finding out that Algiada's scheme, that's not the astrozoan scheme.

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:50]** That is Algiada's.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:53]** This is the real Algiada was the one...

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:54]** Or was it?

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:59]** You know, was it the Astrozoans and Captain Ramin was catching on to the Astrozoans?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:08]** Yeah, I will say that in as much as you know, it looked like that communication was not recent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:10]** Yeah.

**[01:25:10 - 01:25:17]** So it was most likely the real Algiata was one skimming off the top and Rameem had caught it.

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:20]** Or, you know, however that was going to work out.

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:21]** Yeah.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:22]** All right.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:24]** So then after that, the graph argument happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:26]** The Grath argument happens with Nico.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:28]** And then you guys go talk to Grath for a bit.

**[01:25:28 - 01:25:30]** And then that's when we have a cool little thing.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:34]** It's up to you, Kev, if you want to talk about it at all.

**[01:25:34 - 01:25:39]** But there was a moment where Rick notices a picture and Grath was showing some pictures of Akiton.

**[01:25:39 - 01:25:43]** And then I'm curious, Rick, how you took that.

**[01:25:43 - 01:25:45]** You don't have to say anything if you want, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:45 - 01:25:53]** So Rick saw the Yosokis in the background and noticed the town, the image that he saw, he recognized it.

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:55]** Yeah.

**[01:25:55 - 01:25:58]** And it cued him in because that is actually, Rick is from Akitan.

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:06]** So he recognized the area where Grath is from and knew that location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:06 - 01:26:08]** Yep.

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:08]** Yeah.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:11]** Little peek behind the Rick curtain here.

**[01:26:12 - 01:26:13]** So then you guys are leaving Akitan.

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:17]** And that's when Song comes up and is like, hey, I really need your help.

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:22]** Because I think at this point, I'm trying to remember where you guys were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:30]** When did we move the bed and find the grate underneath the bed?

**[01:26:31 - 01:26:32]** That was before we talked to Song, right?

**[01:26:32 - 01:26:34]** I think we went back and did that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:34 - 01:26:36]** Yeah, I thought you went back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:37 - 01:26:38]** Yeah, I don't remember where we went back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:40]** I think you went back there after the fight with Jinchiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:41 - 01:26:42]** Okay, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:42]** Yeah.

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:43]** Never mind.

**[01:26:43 - 01:26:44]** No, it's okay.

**[01:26:44 - 01:26:47]** So then Song comes up and is like, hey, I really need help.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:51]** The goblins are attacking me and tearing up the hallway downstairs.

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:53]** So you guys run downstairs.

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:57]** And prior to this, you had really only had one engagement with Jinchiroga and the goblins.

**[01:26:57 - 01:26:57]** Well, not one.

**[01:26:57 - 01:27:03]** You had had several, but the last one was in the gym when you guys talked to Jinchiroga and the goblins.

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:08]** And then now suddenly the goblins are like shooting up the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:08 - 01:27:12]** Was that... They were tearing things up, yeah.

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:17]** And then we tried to talk them down and they... They were not ready to be talked down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:18]** And then they had a map on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:20]** They did.

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:21]** On a pillowcase, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:23]** Yes, this is that map I was talking about earlier.

**[01:27:24 - 01:27:24]** On a pillowcase.

**[01:27:25 - 01:27:26]** Just scribbled on a pillowcase.

**[01:27:27 - 01:27:31]** But it was basically the layout of the ship and there were spots and locations that were circled.

**[01:27:32 - 01:27:38]** And each of the locations that were circled coincide with where we found Star Dream indicators.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:48]** And then the goblins were like, And then that's when you guys were like, oh shit, we need to go to the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:51]** Because Jujuroga is on the bridge trying to take it over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:51 - 01:27:52]** Yeah.

**[01:27:52 - 01:27:58]** And I think Nico and I actually wanted to split off and look right away for those spots on that pillowcase map.

**[01:27:58 - 01:27:59]** And then we're like, oh, okay, fine.

**[01:28:00 - 01:28:01]** We'll help out first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:28:03 - 01:28:08]** Also, we're told over and over again not to split the party.

**[01:28:08 - 01:28:11]** Looking back on this, I don't know.

**[01:28:11 - 01:28:15]** Is there ever a good time to split the party down the middle in half?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:21]** I mean, if you would have split that party and tried to fight Gingeroga, somebody would have died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:22]** Someone definitely would have died.

**[01:28:22 - 01:28:25]** I mean, Niko almost already died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:26]** Yeah.

**[01:28:26 - 01:28:30]** I think from battling, for sure, it's generally almost never advisable.

**[01:28:31 - 01:28:33]** But for splitting, I don't know.

**[01:28:34 - 01:28:36]** I was really tempted to in that moment, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:37 - 01:28:38]** You could have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:38 - 01:28:39]** But yeah, it's not a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:39 - 01:28:41]** I'm never going to tell you not to split the party.

**[01:28:41 - 01:28:43]** John encourages it.

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:46]** I'm just never going to tell you not to do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:47]** That's it.

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:48]** That's okay.

**[01:28:48 - 01:28:50]** It was a fun fight with Jujuraga, so can't complain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:50 - 01:28:51]** Yeah, that fight was fun.

**[01:28:51 - 01:28:52]** What was your thought?

**[01:28:53 - 01:28:56]** Were you expecting that she was going to go take the bridge?

**[01:28:56 - 01:28:58]** It seemed like it was a surprise.

**[01:28:59 - 01:29:06]** And then when you opened the door, she actually was like, hey, if you want to join me and help take over the bridge, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:06 - 01:29:09]** See, and again, this is talking like bigger scheme things.

**[01:29:09 - 01:29:11]** Was she a part of this?

**[01:29:12 - 01:29:13]** Was she a distraction of some sort?

**[01:29:14 - 01:29:17]** So, okay, with the goblins, the goblins ended.

**[01:29:17 - 01:29:22]** We actually kept one alive and then Nico decided to execute it.

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:24]** I did.

**[01:29:25 - 01:29:26]** He did.

**[01:29:26 - 01:29:30]** I wanted Nick to... I think after some questions.

**[01:29:30 - 01:29:30]** You went on tape.

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:32]** I just wanted to verify.

**[01:29:32 - 01:29:33]** You went on tape.

**[01:29:34 - 01:29:39]** And then we went to the bridge and when we opened the door to the bridge, we leveled up.

**[01:29:40 - 01:29:40]** Yep.

**[01:29:40 - 01:29:41]** Level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:41 - 01:29:41]** Yep.

**[01:29:42 - 01:29:43]** Time slowed down.

**[01:29:43 - 01:29:46]** You guys were like... Energized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:47 - 01:29:52]** And then we stepped into that room and Ginger Roga was no longer a hobgoblin.

**[01:29:54 - 01:29:57]** She was actually a werewolf type creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:57 - 01:30:03]** Yeah, a creature called a barghest that has an alternate form as a goblinoid of some sort.

**[01:30:03 - 01:30:10]** And then otherwise they are... Those are cool creatures because one of the things that they can do is they can almost swallow a whole.

**[01:30:10 - 01:30:17]** So they can almost eat somebody and devour somebody in less than 10 seconds or something.

**[01:30:17 - 01:30:27]** And the point is, is that those creatures in their society, the more they eat other beings, the more they grow and they get stronger.

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:34]** And so some of the older ones are like these huge creatures that have just are like hella powerful.

**[01:30:35 - 01:30:36]** Anyway, so...

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:43]** Besides that, Nico almost goes down, and then you guys take down Gingeroga, and then you talk to the captain.

**[01:30:43 - 01:30:44]** Probably for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:44 - 01:30:53]** This is already the first mind-messing situation, where Gingeroga is actually a shapeshifter.

**[01:30:53 - 01:30:55]** But something we learned, I believe, because Dr.

**[01:30:55 - 01:30:55]** O.K.

**[01:30:55 - 01:30:59]** 's skill checks, is that Gingeroga can only change into one person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:01]** Yes.

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:02]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:03]** And so that's shapeshift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:05]** Hashtag life science.

**[01:31:05 - 01:31:06]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:31:06 - 01:31:09]** Good OP skill to have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:09 - 01:31:10]** It really is OP.

**[01:31:11 - 01:31:11]** Yeah, it's good.

**[01:31:12 - 01:31:21]** So at this point, I believe I was thinking that Gingeroga wasn't the only bear cast on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:21 - 01:31:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:31]** And that I thought that Keeve was also a bar guest and that we would go down there and Keeve would have time to devour all these other passengers on board.

**[01:31:31 - 01:31:35]** And we would have to fight a giant werewolf creature thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:42]** I think then you were still suspicious of Lozu because you had the four LP ship repairs, which that was literally just that.

**[01:31:42 - 01:31:47]** I think when you confronted her about it, she was like, I have a gambling problem and I had to borrow money.

**[01:31:47 - 01:31:50]** And Algiata paid me back with money that was meant for ship repairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:52 - 01:31:52]** Yep.

**[01:31:53 - 01:31:55]** And we didn't really get much from the captain during this.

**[01:31:56 - 01:31:56]** Nope.

**[01:31:56 - 01:31:58]** And then the captain decided to go to his room.

**[01:31:58 - 01:31:58]** Yep.

**[01:31:59 - 01:32:00]** And Grath took him there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:07]** And the next time we found the captain... Well, before we get there, there was one other thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:07]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:08]** The captain's dead.

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:08]** The captain's dead.

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:10]** But he was dead before that, right?

**[01:32:11 - 01:32:12]** We don't know.

**[01:32:12 - 01:32:12]** We don't know.

**[01:32:12 - 01:32:14]** We don't know when the captain was dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:16]** Well, here's something.

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:21]** I think at that point, Will, do you want to say anything about one of the boosters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:32:21 - 01:32:38]** Yeah, one of the other moments for Dr. Okay was, I think, I don't remember exactly how you said it, John, and I wanted actually to clarify, if you could, what about that medic pack was,

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:44]** that I recognize that was like peculiar to me that seemed glitchy.

**[01:32:45 - 01:32:46]** The diorama.

**[01:32:46 - 01:32:49]** Is it like the chemical?

**[01:32:49 - 01:32:57]** Like I think what I imagined was like, it was somehow linked to my 24 hour flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:57 - 01:33:05]** Yeah, right, where, like, the name on the Mark I healing serum was Diorama on the actual injectable itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:13]** But the injectable is, like, exactly my stuff, or is it, like... No, it wasn't necessarily that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:13 - 01:33:25]** It was just that the name on the injectable was Diorama, and that was the same name that was on some of the boxes that were on Javon when you were there with Dr. Bouchakis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:33:25 - 01:33:29]** Right, but I don't know anything about that name apart from that.

**[01:33:30 - 01:33:31]** I don't think so, no.

**[01:33:32 - 01:33:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:32 - 01:33:35]** We know they're connected, is all we do know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:45]** But I know that that med pack effectively originated from that moment in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:47]** For the audience, John is shrugging.

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:49]** Yeah, that's what I thought.

**[01:33:49 - 01:33:50]** Okay.

**[01:33:50 - 01:33:53]** So, layer of plot armor there for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:33:53 - 01:34:02]** Okay, what I wanted to know is, like, do I look at the chemicals that were made and, like, do I see, like, oh, this was, you know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:02 - 01:34:26]** produced by this process uh that i know specifically only appears in the university that i you know work out i think if you wanted to do that i i think you still have some more of those mark one healing serums yeah because there were some in uh professor ben's room when you guys were leaving so you could do that you could take a look at the compound okay yeah yeah

**[01:34:27 - 01:34:28]** I'll do that at some point.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:29]** Yeah.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:30]** And then you guys.

**[01:34:30 - 01:34:30]** Right now.

**[01:34:31 - 01:34:32]** Right now.

**[01:34:32 - 01:34:33]** Let's play right now.

**[01:34:33 - 01:34:34]** Let's roll out that whole scene.

**[01:34:35 - 01:34:41]** This is kind of the point where you guys started to like, like things started to really escalate if they hadn't already.

**[01:34:41 - 01:34:44]** Because now you guys are like, all right, let's follow the map.

**[01:34:44 - 01:34:49]** That's when you go back to Algiata's room and you find the grate with the weird sticky substance.

**[01:34:49 - 01:34:50]** That's when you go looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:50 - 01:34:52]** Was Algiata's room highlighted on the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:52 - 01:34:53]** I think it was.

**[01:34:53 - 01:34:54]** Yeah.

**[01:34:54 - 01:34:58]** Or if, if it wasn't, you guys went back in for some reason.

**[01:34:58 - 01:35:02]** I can't remember what that was, but that's when you found the, the great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:02 - 01:35:02]** Yeah.

**[01:35:02 - 01:35:09]** We pulled apart that we pulled open the bed and underneath the bed, there was a great that was too small for a normal sized person to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:35:09 - 01:35:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:10 - 01:35:12]** And it had like a slime to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:35:13 - 01:35:14]** And it was a very small grade.

**[01:35:14 - 01:35:15]** It was like what?

**[01:35:15 - 01:35:17]** Like six inches by a foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:35:17 - 01:35:18]** Yeah.

**[01:35:19 - 01:35:19]** And so I,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:22]** I think we did some checks on it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:27]** Yeah, and we determined that some compressible creature could have made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:27 - 01:35:32]** Could manipulate himself or herself through said grid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:35:33 - 01:35:35]** And then you followed all the other circles on the map.

**[01:35:36 - 01:35:39]** And there were a couple in the engineering lower section.

**[01:35:39 - 01:35:43]** There was one like up in the computer bank area.

**[01:35:43 - 01:35:45]** There was actually one near where Kiev, I think, was working.

**[01:35:46 - 01:35:48]** There was one over in the opposite side.

**[01:35:49 - 01:35:52]** And that's when you all started to go down there and look around.

**[01:35:53 - 01:35:55]** And that's when you split the party, actually, if I remember right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:55 - 01:35:56]** A little bit.

**[01:35:56 - 01:35:58]** I mean, like the next room over.

**[01:35:58 - 01:35:59]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:35:59 - 01:36:01]** But you're still splitting the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:02]** Even that could be dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:02 - 01:36:03]** I think it was more...

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:06]** Yeah, and it got pretty close.

**[01:36:06 - 01:36:07]** So we got down there.

**[01:36:07 - 01:36:08]** We were following the map.

**[01:36:09 - 01:36:10]** We checked all the locations.

**[01:36:10 - 01:36:21]** And when we got down there, basically the party split because Nico and Hears were interested in the locations on the map because they thought it would be something lucrative.

**[01:36:22 - 01:36:25]** And Rick's motivations at that time was just to clear the room.

**[01:36:26 - 01:36:30]** There's something dangerous and he doesn't want something to pop out at them.

**[01:36:30 - 01:36:33]** And so that's where the party split was the two of them were like, well, we're going to go check it out.

**[01:36:33 - 01:36:36]** And Rick was like, well, I'm going to go clear the rest of this area.

**[01:36:36 - 01:36:40]** And so when we cleared the rest of that area, two things happen.

**[01:36:41 - 01:36:46]** And so for, for Rick and Dr. Okay, we found this other door and,

**[01:36:46 - 01:36:47]** And I'll pause there.

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:49]** And then Kelly, go ahead.

**[01:36:50 - 01:36:52]** Tell us what happened with you and Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:52]** Yeah.

**[01:36:54 - 01:36:54]** What?

**[01:36:54 - 01:36:55]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:36:55 - 01:36:56]** We found this.

**[01:36:56 - 01:36:59]** I think we heard something drop behind us.

**[01:37:00 - 01:37:04]** And then we looked around and there was this figure of a rocket ship.

**[01:37:04 - 01:37:08]** And we inspected it closer and there was this blood on it.

**[01:37:08 - 01:37:11]** Uh, and we saw that it came from the grate up there.

**[01:37:11 - 01:37:14]** I cast some kind of like light spell to see if we could see something.

**[01:37:14 - 01:37:15]** We saw slime up there.

**[01:37:15 - 01:37:18]** So similar to what was kind of climbing through into Algiata's room.

**[01:37:19 - 01:37:21]** Um, and then we showed it to you guys.

**[01:37:22 - 01:37:27]** And at some point we found the body of the captain, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:37:27 - 01:37:29]** We didn't find the body.

**[01:37:29 - 01:37:31]** We found the idol with the blood on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:33]** We found the body shortly after.

**[01:37:34 - 01:37:35]** In the other cargo bay.

**[01:37:35 - 01:37:36]** The port one, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:37:37 - 01:37:38]** In the secret cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:37:40 - 01:37:56]** If you had gone to look at in the captain's room, you would have found on his desk the desk would have been maybe a little dusty, but there would have been a circle that fits the perfect size of that.

**[01:37:56 - 01:38:12]** statue which is a statue of the idari which is the kasathan like generational ship that is uh technically you know part of the pack worlds um and so that's that's that's what you guys would have found among other things if you had gone to look at the captain's room

**[01:38:12 - 01:38:13]** See, that's it.

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:13]** That's it.

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:14]** Well played, Will.

**[01:38:14 - 01:38:15]** Well played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:38:15 - 01:38:19]** So at that point, you guys came over and joined us and said, hey, we found this.

**[01:38:19 - 01:38:24]** We went back, I think, because we heard the noise, and we cleared out the area and said there were no hostiles.

**[01:38:25 - 01:38:30]** And so then we told you about the door, and you guys came and helped us hack the door open.

**[01:38:30 - 01:38:30]** Yep.

**[01:38:30 - 01:38:35]** And so that door was actually a secret door that wasn't very apparent, right?


## Speaker_0

**[01:38:35 - 01:38:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:35 - 01:38:37]** Yeah, it was hidden.

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:46]** And I think at some point, I think Graf had mentioned that the captain had a kind of a shady past as well.

**[01:38:47 - 01:38:50]** And so I remember here as being like, wait, what?

**[01:38:50 - 01:38:53]** And like when Graf mentioned that.

**[01:38:53 - 01:39:02]** And that room was a place where they would keep any sort of illicit goods or people or something.

**[01:39:02 - 01:39:06]** But when you went in there, that's when you found the body of Captain Ramim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:39:06 - 01:39:14]** Yeah, so this kind of distracted us from pursuing... Because half our goal was to find Keeve down in the engine bay.

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:18]** And also because the other part of the engine room had a circle around it.

**[01:39:18 - 01:39:20]** So we were also going to inspect that location.

**[01:39:20 - 01:39:22]** But this kind of distracted us.

**[01:39:22 - 01:39:23]** And so we opened up that door.

**[01:39:23 - 01:39:24]** We go inside.

**[01:39:24 - 01:39:25]** We find the dead Captain Rameem.

**[01:39:26 - 01:39:32]** And thanks to another life science check, we know that he is, in fact, a... Kasafin.

**[01:39:32 - 01:39:34]** Kasafin.

**[01:39:34 - 01:39:37]** And not whatever shapeshifter is there.

**[01:39:38 - 01:39:41]** But we had indication that there was shapeshifters, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:39:41 - 01:39:41]** At this point, we knew.

**[01:39:41 - 01:39:45]** I think it was at that point when you all were like, wait a minute.

**[01:39:47 - 01:39:49]** Who is the Captain Mervin that we saw?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:39:49 - 01:39:54]** I'm really surprised we didn't do a medical check on him to see how long he was dead.

**[01:39:55 - 01:39:56]** That would have helped with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:39:56 - 01:39:58]** I thought that you did.

**[01:39:58 - 01:39:59]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:39:59 - 01:40:02]** He had died within the past day, I think, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:40:03 - 01:40:08]** He had died within less time than the last time we had seen the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:08 - 01:40:09]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:40:09 - 01:40:15]** Also, I have a bone to pick about this, too.

**[01:40:16 - 01:40:17]** Yeah.

**[01:40:17 - 01:40:17]** Okay.

**[01:40:18 - 01:40:21]** So Trostnik was Astrozone the whole time, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:23 - 01:40:25]** Yeah, I think that was confirmed at the very end.

**[01:40:25 - 01:40:28]** And just a quick point of comparison.

**[01:40:29 - 01:40:39]** I think what I told you about Captain Rameem was that he had been dead within the past 12 hours or something.

**[01:40:40 - 01:40:49]** So essentially long enough for you guys... Not long enough of several days, so after you guys aborted, but after...

**[01:40:51 - 01:40:54]** or before the fight with Jin Chiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:54 - 01:40:57]** So the captain on there was not the real captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:57 - 01:41:01]** Which is why you guys were like, wait a minute, who was the captain that we just saw?

**[01:41:01 - 01:41:01]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:41:01 - 01:41:08]** And that's our first cue, there were shapeshifters, and we had just interacted with a shapeshifter, the Barcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:08 - 01:41:09]** Right.

**[01:41:09 - 01:41:11]** And then you were like, oh wait, was the captain also a shapeshifter?

**[01:41:12 - 01:41:13]** Will, what's your bone to pick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:41:14 - 01:41:18]** So part of the biohacker...

**[01:41:18 - 01:41:40]** class is you have equipment for a custom micro lab yeah and i had attuned my micro lab i thought to astrozoic right so i would be able to not yet though did you yeah when is it tuned into trust today


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:41 - 01:41:44]** But it was right after you found the body that Trostnik was like, hey, what's up?

**[01:41:45 - 01:41:46]** What are you guys doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:41:46 - 01:41:49]** Yeah, you hadn't attuned it yet because we didn't even know what astrozoans were at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:49 - 01:41:49]** Okay.

**[01:41:49 - 01:41:49]** Yeah.

**[01:41:50 - 01:41:55]** And even if you had gone and checked the Captain Ramune's body, it would have still just come up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:41:56 - 01:42:03]** No, but the other Astrozoans, any other Astrozoans, I would have, like, Yeah, we hadn't run into Astrozoans yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:03 - 01:42:05]** Yeah, no, you hadn't run into Astrozoans.

**[01:42:05 - 01:42:15]** Because while we were inspecting that room, there was, like, the crate or whatever, there was actually the access later on, and Rick had taken Sentry, and you guys were off exploring.

**[01:42:16 - 01:42:18]** That's when Trussanet came into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:42:19 - 01:42:21]** No, it was when you were all in there at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:22 - 01:42:26]** Yeah, but the three of them were looking at something around that corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:26]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:30]** And Rick was like, well, I'm going to stand guard because I don't trust anything going on right now.

**[01:42:30 - 01:42:37]** And that's when the door opens up and Trusnick walks in to this super secret room that we find the dead captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:42:37 - 01:42:59]** but i will say that there were opportunities if you guys wanted to talk to the captain on the bridge more the captain at who was on the bridge you know likely astra's own captain had their own motivations but if you guys like like there were opportunities there for you guys to find out more and possibly question whether that was the real captain there

**[01:43:00 - 01:43:02]** So that could have been, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:02 - 01:43:06]** Well, and that's something, again, with my initial response.

**[01:43:06 - 01:43:22]** And we could talk about, since it is plot armor, there was this incident during this interaction that Trusnik walks through that door and I, as a player, recognize that there was something wrong with him being in the room with the dead captain.

**[01:43:24 - 01:43:29]** I didn't know yet that it was Nastrasowin, but I did know that Trusnik was the bad guy.

**[01:43:30 - 01:43:35]** And so my initial response as Rick was to shoot him.

**[01:43:36 - 01:43:40]** And I'm not sure how we finally edited it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:43:40 - 01:43:47]** I think in-game we just stopped because I was worried that I had communicated the wrong idea to you.

**[01:43:47 - 01:43:52]** And I didn't know if you were misunderstanding or if I had just done a bad job of saying whatever it was.

**[01:43:52 - 01:43:53]** And I forget what it was exactly.

**[01:43:54 - 01:43:58]** But I was like, wait, let's just rewind the tape if that's okay and make sure you understand.

**[01:43:58 - 01:44:01]** And then once you understood, you were like, okay, then I won't shoot.

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:03]** Although you did end up just shooting anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:03 - 01:44:04]** Yeah, yeah, I should have just shot.

**[01:44:04 - 01:44:05]** You should have just stuck with it.

**[01:44:06 - 01:44:06]** I was right.

**[01:44:07 - 01:44:09]** I should have shot him back in the cargo bay.

**[01:44:09 - 01:44:11]** The cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:11 - 01:44:12]** In the starboard cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:12 - 01:44:24]** But after the fight with Tristanek, because he does actually indicate that he is not the real Tristanek and that he was there for shady reasons.

**[01:44:24 - 01:44:26]** And he actually draws and fires on us first.

**[01:44:28 - 01:44:28]** We end up killing him.

**[01:44:28 - 01:44:32]** And when he dies, he transforms into a giant starfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:33 - 01:44:34]** Yep.

**[01:44:34 - 01:44:35]** Astrozone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:35 - 01:44:40]** That was the first time that we saw an Astrozone and that was after a life science check that Dr. O.K.

**[01:44:40 - 01:44:42]** recognized it was Astrozone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:42 - 01:44:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:44 - 01:44:49]** And then at that point the Astrozone wasn't quite dead though and so we put it in a box again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:49 - 01:44:53]** And then you did kill it though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:53 - 01:44:55]** And then you did kill them.

**[01:44:55 - 01:44:55]** Let's clarify this.

**[01:44:55 - 01:44:57]** Who killed the Astrozone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:44:57 - 01:44:58]** I killed him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:58 - 01:44:59]** Oh yeah, you did.

**[01:44:59 - 01:45:01]** The murder bot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:45:01 - 01:45:18]** allowed the other guy to kill him yep yep where are you trying to make the case that you're not that that's what i think i think kev's got some other agenda here with his plot armor episode and then get on your soapbox ricks that's fine

**[01:45:18 - 01:45:23]** And then that's when you guys were like, all right, let's explore this secret shaft that goes up.

**[01:45:23 - 01:45:23]** Yeah.

**[01:45:23 - 01:45:31]** And then that, I think, was the first time when you go up, there are three possible ways to leave the shaft from the bottom.

**[01:45:31 - 01:45:35]** And there was two doors in the mid-level and one hatch at the top.

**[01:45:36 - 01:45:39]** And I can tell you guys that the hatch...

**[01:45:39 - 01:46:02]** actually would have gone up to the bridge so if you guys had had had had hit the right notes on the bridge for perception figuring some things out you would have been like oh the captain's chair swivels and then you open up the hatch to go into the shaft and then i think that was when you guys were like okay well if we go into the left door the right door which one and then you go into the right door and that's the starboard cargo bay uh

**[01:46:02 - 01:46:05]** And then that's when you meet the only cargo bay.

**[01:46:05 - 01:46:06]** I will say this.

**[01:46:06 - 01:46:14]** There is a point where I will tell you why to clear my name.

**[01:46:14 - 01:46:16]** I genuinely didn't try and keep you guys from that cargo bay.

**[01:46:17 - 01:46:19]** I can tell you guys at a certain point later.

**[01:46:19 - 01:46:23]** I don't know if it's at the end of book two, three, four, five, six.

**[01:46:23 - 01:46:34]** I can tell you guys what would have happened if you if if you had known apparently that there was and I had been if that was very clear, I can tell you guys what would have happened and you would have been like, oh, OK, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:46:34 - 01:46:35]** Yeah.

**[01:46:35 - 01:46:41]** But at this point in the game, there were two options and we literally rolled a dice for it and said, you know, flip to go to the right.

**[01:46:41 - 01:46:43]** And we have gone to the right.

**[01:46:43 - 01:46:50]** But we do know we very quickly after that go to the port cargo bay.

**[01:46:51 - 01:46:54]** And that would have just happened sooner.

**[01:46:54 - 01:47:02]** Because the events that happened in that cargo bay when we get there were already in motion when we went to the starboard cargo bay the second time.

**[01:47:03 - 01:47:04]** So we kick down that cargo bay.

**[01:47:04 - 01:47:05]** We open the door.

**[01:47:05 - 01:47:06]** We go in.

**[01:47:06 - 01:47:08]** And this is fun for Hears.

**[01:47:09 - 01:47:10]** Who do we run into?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:47:10 - 01:47:11]** Hears.

**[01:47:12 - 01:47:22]** Is this where we run into a beautiful bearded woman dwarf who like accuses me of destroying her entire family, basically.

**[01:47:23 - 01:47:26]** And it's like, here's you murdered everyone.

**[01:47:26 - 01:47:28]** And then here's like, I have my husband, Godwin.

**[01:47:28 - 01:47:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:29 - 01:47:32]** And my son, Godwin the second and myself, Godwina.

**[01:47:33 - 01:47:34]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:47:34 - 01:47:35]** But they were pirates.

**[01:47:35 - 01:47:35]** Awkward moment.

**[01:47:35 - 01:47:36]** Was she a pirate, though?

**[01:47:36 - 01:47:37]** Oh, yeah, I guess she was.

**[01:47:38 - 01:47:38]** She was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:38 - 01:47:39]** She was part of the Starfishers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:40]** I don't know.

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:42]** It was incredibly confusing.

**[01:47:42 - 01:47:46]** But then I was told that I did not, in fact, murder her family.

**[01:47:46 - 01:47:49]** That the idea was planted into her head.

**[01:47:49 - 01:47:51]** Which, hopefully, that's the case.

**[01:47:52 - 01:47:52]** Yeah, programmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:47:54 - 01:47:55]** So a short fight ensues.

**[01:47:55 - 01:47:56]** We end up fighting.

**[01:47:57 - 01:47:59]** There was Godwina, the dwarf.

**[01:47:59 - 01:48:01]** Yep.

**[01:48:01 - 01:48:02]** And then Sabrina.

**[01:48:02 - 01:48:04]** Sabrina, the red-headed human.

**[01:48:04 - 01:48:05]** And then the Vesk.

**[01:48:06 - 01:48:06]** And then the Vesk.

**[01:48:07 - 01:48:11]** I think Rick killed the Vesk with a super shot charged up by Hears.

**[01:48:11 - 01:48:13]** Thank you, Hears.

**[01:48:13 - 01:48:14]** Classic tactic.

**[01:48:14 - 01:48:14]** I love that.

**[01:48:14 - 01:48:18]** And then we took down the other two non-lethally.

**[01:48:19 - 01:48:27]** Yeah, so after we took them, we actually took them kind of prisoner and used them as shields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:48:28 - 01:48:30]** This whole fight was just insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:48:30 - 01:48:31]** Very smart tactic.

**[01:48:32 - 01:48:39]** Yeah, so at this point, the ship was definitely under siege by a group of pirates known as the Starfishers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:48:39 - 01:48:42]** And you had heard this when you were in the secret shaft.

**[01:48:43 - 01:48:46]** You heard the boom of them breaching the doors above you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:48:47 - 01:48:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:48:47 - 01:48:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:48:48 - 01:48:59]** And something that came up in our conversations with Godwina and Sabrina was that there were three Astrozoans within the Starfishers, but they weren't considered Starfishers.

**[01:48:59 - 01:49:01]** They weren't actually part of the pirate group.

**[01:49:01 - 01:49:06]** They were like a detached, you know, they weren't accepted as Starfishers.

**[01:49:06 - 01:49:08]** They were like the new guys, the rookies.

**[01:49:09 - 01:49:10]** But two of them had been on board the whole time.

**[01:49:11 - 01:49:13]** The third one came on board with them.

**[01:49:13 - 01:49:14]** And we got their names.

**[01:49:16 - 01:49:16]** I forget what they are.

**[01:49:16 - 01:49:18]** Puck and something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:49:19 - 01:49:21]** Yeah, it was Cub and Wem.

**[01:49:21 - 01:49:24]** And what was the last one?

**[01:49:25 - 01:49:25]** Josh.

**[01:49:26 - 01:49:27]** Yep.

**[01:49:27 - 01:49:27]** Yep.

**[01:49:27 - 01:49:28]** Josh.

**[01:49:28 - 01:49:28]** You nailed it.

**[01:49:29 - 01:49:29]** You got it.

**[01:49:30 - 01:49:31]** Yeah.

**[01:49:31 - 01:49:39]** And then I think you guys go and you actually, you heard a boom, or sorry, a banging from the gym next door.


## Speaker_0

**[01:49:39 - 01:49:40]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:49:40 - 01:49:40]** Yaks.

**[01:49:41 - 01:49:42]** Yaks was the other one.

**[01:49:42 - 01:49:42]** Yaks, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:49:43 - 01:49:43]** Yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:49:44 - 01:49:45]** So we heard banging through the door.

**[01:49:46 - 01:49:46]** Through the wall.

**[01:49:46 - 01:49:48]** We should have just gone back through that shaft.

**[01:49:50 - 01:49:51]** But we chose to go around.

**[01:49:52 - 01:49:53]** Yeah, I didn't think about that at the time.

**[01:49:54 - 01:49:54]** Hindsight being 20-20.

**[01:49:56 - 01:50:01]** So we end up... But on our way, though... So we take Godwina and we take Sabrina.

**[01:50:02 - 01:50:03]** And we get around to the gym.

**[01:50:04 - 01:50:09]** And when we get to the gym, we look through the door and we see... A dual low zoo.


## Speaker_0

**[01:50:10 - 01:50:10]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:10 - 01:50:11]** Duelozoos.

**[01:50:11 - 01:50:12]** Duelozoos.

**[01:50:13 - 01:50:15]** Yeah, that was another fun moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:50:15 - 01:50:17]** And a frustrating fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:17 - 01:50:18]** Super frustrating.

**[01:50:18 - 01:50:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:50:18 - 01:50:19]** Let's hear about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:19 - 01:50:23]** Because grenades are stupid and the clone tool is dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:50:23 - 01:50:23]** Mirror image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:50:24 - 01:50:25]** The holographic clone.

**[01:50:25 - 01:50:30]** You just need the grenade feet is what you need, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:30 - 01:50:32]** Grenade mastery.

**[01:50:32 - 01:50:33]** Okay, let's roll back a little bit.

**[01:50:33 - 01:50:35]** So we see the two Lozus in the room.

**[01:50:36 - 01:50:36]** We open the door.

**[01:50:37 - 01:50:44]** I actually push Sabrina down on her knees and use her as a shield as we get into a standoff with these two Lozus.

**[01:50:44 - 01:50:47]** And it comes down to that game of who's the real Lozu?

**[01:50:47 - 01:50:49]** Because one of these is the real Lozu, one of them's not.

**[01:50:50 - 01:50:54]** But it was pretty easy to recognize because one of them was in a pilot gear.

**[01:50:54 - 01:50:54]** Yep.

**[01:50:55 - 01:50:57]** And the other one was in regular clothing.


## Speaker_0

**[01:50:57 - 01:50:57]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:57 - 01:50:58]** yeah.

**[01:50:58 - 01:51:03]** So we had found a grenade and, you know, we went through the whole argument of how grenades work.

**[01:51:03 - 01:51:10]** One thing we have learned about grenades is that you can throw them further just with a penalty.

**[01:51:11 - 01:51:13]** And so you're less, less accurate to throw it.

**[01:51:13 - 01:51:15]** Um, so that would have helped make sense.

**[01:51:16 - 01:51:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:51:16 - 01:51:17]** Which makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:51:18 - 01:51:24]** And you can also like, there's different things you can do as a character, uh,

**[01:51:24 - 01:51:26]** And different classes that have grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:51:26 - 01:51:27]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:51:27 - 01:51:28]** Exactly.

**[01:51:28 - 01:51:30]** But we don't have those options at this level.

**[01:51:30 - 01:51:30]** Right.

**[01:51:32 - 01:51:38]** But the biggest problem with the grenade in the end scheme of things was that it wouldn't have done what we thought it would have done in the first place.

**[01:51:38 - 01:51:44]** So what happened is that out of the two Lozus, they multiplied into seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:51:44 - 01:51:45]** I think it was five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:51:45 - 01:51:47]** 16.

**[01:51:47 - 01:51:50]** There were 16 Lozus all standing there.

**[01:51:50 - 01:51:53]** Because the bad Lozu, which turned out to be an AstraZeneca.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:51:53 - 01:51:55]** There was an infinite series of Lozus.

**[01:51:56 - 01:51:59]** But they were seemingly not.

**[01:51:59 - 01:52:01]** Because they couldn't be killed by grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:52:01 - 01:52:03]** Well, they couldn't be hit by any area damage.

**[01:52:03 - 01:52:04]** Yeah.

**[01:52:04 - 01:52:06]** So grenade would have been useless anyways.

**[01:52:07 - 01:52:08]** That battle was frustrating.

**[01:52:08 - 01:52:09]** We got through it.

**[01:52:10 - 01:52:12]** We saved real Lozu.

**[01:52:13 - 01:52:16]** And we... Godwina, I think, tried to escape at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:52:16 - 01:52:18]** We didn't save the real Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:52:19 - 01:52:20]** Well, you did, but then she got knocked down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:52:20 - 01:52:22]** She was fake Lozu.

**[01:52:22 - 01:52:22]** Failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:52:23 - 01:52:27]** And then we had a little bit of a dark moment there from Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:27 - 01:52:28]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:52:28 - 01:52:30]** You want to elaborate?

**[01:52:30 - 01:52:30]** Where...

**[01:52:31 - 01:52:37]** As we're getting ready to leave, Nico was just kind of along the lines of, well, there are two things here.

**[01:52:38 - 01:52:44]** One, Nico's on the run, so he doesn't want anybody being able to come back and tell a tale where he was at or where he is now.

**[01:52:46 - 01:52:49]** Take no prisoners kind of mindset from Nico.

**[01:52:50 - 01:52:51]** The crew was getting ready to leave.

**[01:52:51 - 01:52:55]** Nico was going to go execute the prisoners, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:55 - 01:53:06]** And then Lozu in her moment, her climax, I think of transitioning into the confident leader that she is said, hold up, let's just tie them up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:53:07 - 01:53:07]** No.

**[01:53:07 - 01:53:17]** So, I mean, going forward in the story that I think it's a cool plot moment to remind the listeners of like, that's something that's going on in Nika.

**[01:53:17 - 01:53:22]** He's definitely having a struggle between light and dark morality and just kind of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:53:23 - 01:53:43]** survival by any means by any means necessary and that's I mean that's fair I think because like even even Rick being like the lawful good not murder bot at that point was like well we can't just leave these prisoners behind us because they've already tried to escape multiple times and anytime you leave somebody alive behind you they end up coming back to hurt you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:43 - 01:53:47]** And then that's why Lozu said, well, let's just knock them out and lock the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:53:48 - 01:53:48]** And that's what we did.

**[01:53:49 - 01:53:51]** So right after that fight, we locked the doors.

**[01:53:52 - 01:53:55]** Our next mission, we know now that there's something going on in the cargo bay.

**[01:53:55 - 01:54:00]** The other cargo bay, the port cargo bay, the second cargo bay.

**[01:54:00 - 01:54:01]** Where you could have gone from the beginning.

**[01:54:02 - 01:54:04]** And so we move into that second cargo bay.

**[01:54:04 - 01:54:05]** And who do we find?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:54:07 - 01:54:08]** We find Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:09 - 01:54:15]** And then she pleaded for your help saying, you know, the captain is a shape changer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:54:15 - 01:54:16]** Well, that's, so that's the thing.

**[01:54:16 - 01:54:26]** We opened that door and we found the cargo box that we were expecting where the relic, we were told the relic is this large cargo box, whatever it was, had all the indications of that.

**[01:54:26 - 01:54:32]** The door was broken off, you know, blown off or torched off or whatever the case is split right open.

**[01:54:33 - 01:54:36]** And Algiata was like halfway in there.

**[01:54:36 - 01:54:42]** And so we get into a standoff because, again, we're down to that situation of, is this the real Algiata?

**[01:54:42 - 01:54:43]** Is it an imposter?

**[01:54:44 - 01:54:45]** Is the real Algiata the bad guy?

**[01:54:46 - 01:54:48]** There were a lot of questions going on, and there was no trust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:54:49 - 01:54:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:54:50 - 01:54:53]** And right as I was about to trust her, Dr. O.K.

**[01:54:53 - 01:54:56]** finds pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:56 - 01:54:57]** Yep.

**[01:54:57 - 01:54:58]** Do you remember that, Dr.

**[01:54:58 - 01:54:58]** O.K.?

**[01:54:59 - 01:55:00]** Yes.

**[01:55:00 - 01:55:00]** Yes.

**[01:55:00 - 01:55:00]** Yes.

**[01:55:03 - 01:55:05]** I believe it was Billy the Pirate.

**[01:55:05 - 01:55:06]** Days away from retirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:55:06 - 01:55:07]** Oh, poor Billy.

**[01:55:07 - 01:55:08]** He was about to retire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:55:09 - 01:55:10]** What did I say to Billy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:55:10 - 01:55:11]** I don't remember.

**[01:55:11 - 01:55:12]** All sorts of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:55:14 - 01:55:15]** All sorts of things.

**[01:55:17 - 01:55:18]** It was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:55:18 - 01:55:19]** Hey, how are you doing?

**[01:55:19 - 01:55:20]** You should just quit.

**[01:55:20 - 01:55:21]** Go home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:55:21 - 01:55:23]** And he was like, yeah, I'm trying to retire, man.

**[01:55:23 - 01:55:24]** It's my last day.

**[01:55:24 - 01:55:24]** Rethink your life.

**[01:55:24 - 01:55:25]** Yeah.

**[01:55:25 - 01:55:26]** Reconsider your decisions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:55:27 - 01:55:27]** Yeah.

**[01:55:27 - 01:55:29]** You want to go home and rethink your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:55:29 - 01:55:30]** But that triggered it.

**[01:55:30 - 01:55:33]** So we know now that this isn't Algiata.

**[01:55:33 - 01:55:36]** Or if it is Algiata, you're working with these pirates.

**[01:55:36 - 01:55:38]** And so Algiata actually attacks us.

**[01:55:38 - 01:55:38]** Indeed.

**[01:55:39 - 01:55:40]** A fight ensues.

**[01:55:41 - 01:55:42]** The real Lozu helps us out.

**[01:55:43 - 01:55:44]** The quote unquote real Lozu.

**[01:55:44 - 01:55:49]** And after that fight, I forget if we killed Adjad or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:55:49 - 01:55:49]** Yes, you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:55:49 - 01:55:51]** I think she killed Adjad.

**[01:55:51 - 01:55:52]** So Adjad got killed.

**[01:55:52 - 01:55:55]** The second pirate that – oh, Billy died.

**[01:55:55 - 01:55:55]** Rest in peace.

**[01:55:56 - 01:56:05]** And then the second pirate known as Second Pirate, she actually puts up her hands and – Surrenders.

**[01:56:05 - 01:56:05]** Surrenders.

**[01:56:06 - 01:56:12]** And so during that, we start to break down and we – what did you find inside the box here is –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:56:12 - 01:56:36]** so first i went in there and then i found a bag and a box so oh no maybe it was the box sorry inside there was a bag and there was a really awesome pokemon basically pokemon super cool who was some incredible creature that oh anyway it has amazing stats it does cool shit so pick that up and then there was one more thing just a bunch of awesome stuff inside

**[01:56:36 - 01:56:41]** Oh, there was an unlimited stuff in the bag or something like that, if I remember correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:56:41 - 01:56:43]** Well, there's the backpack that had the extra space in it.

**[01:56:43 - 01:56:44]** Oh, that's what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:56:44 - 01:56:45]** The Starfinder bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:56:46 - 01:56:48]** Also snagged that.

**[01:56:48 - 01:56:49]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:56:50 - 01:56:56]** Also, the most important thing that was in that bag, Kelly, was something that glowed around you specifically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:56:56 - 01:57:01]** That was in the box inside the crate next to the bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:57:01 - 01:57:08]** Well, that was Kelly's artifact that he got from Roller in the very beginning.

**[01:57:08 - 01:57:10]** Responded to the relic that was in the box.

**[01:57:10 - 01:57:11]** Ah, that's right.

**[01:57:11 - 01:57:13]** That was the end of that episode, I'm pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:57:13 - 01:57:15]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:57:15 - 01:57:23]** And then someone took the relic, and then I don't think any of you speak Aklo yet, but somebody did a culture check.

**[01:57:23 - 01:57:25]** We did to interpret it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:57:26 - 01:57:28]** I think that was me.

**[01:57:28 - 01:57:29]** Yeah, Nico was able to decipher it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:57:30 - 01:57:31]** Yeah, do you remember what it says?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:57:32 - 01:57:32]** Not offhand.

**[01:57:32 - 01:57:33]** No, I'd have to double check.

**[01:57:33 - 01:57:34]** Wasn't it something?

**[01:57:34 - 01:57:35]** I mean.

**[01:57:35 - 01:57:38]** It was just a message to one of the players or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:57:38 - 01:57:40]** Don't let them find out or some nonsense like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:57:40 - 01:57:42]** The relic has been removed.

**[01:57:42 - 01:57:44]** Please reinstall soon.

**[01:57:44 - 01:57:44]** Is that right?

**[01:57:44 - 01:57:45]** Yeah, roughly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:57:45 - 01:57:46]** Yeah, it sounds right.

**[01:57:46 - 01:57:49]** Yeah, a rough translation based on your skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:57:50 - 01:57:58]** So, I guess, also, funny to point out, when we come to the final fight here on this map, what does Hears do?

**[01:57:59 - 01:58:04]** He abandons us and goes into the locker and starts examining the loot first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:58:04 - 01:58:06]** I should say... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[01:58:06 - 01:58:11]** I should say this, because I probably didn't say it at the time, but I was thinking...

**[01:58:11 - 01:58:12]** Look, I'm out of spells.

**[01:58:12 - 01:58:14]** We didn't rest in forever.

**[01:58:14 - 01:58:15]** I was just bone drive everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:58:15 - 01:58:17]** So he was just trying to protect.

**[01:58:17 - 01:58:18]** I was almost dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:58:18 - 01:58:19]** I wasn't trying to protect myself.

**[01:58:20 - 01:58:27]** I was thinking this is like a total like I don't know if this is going to work, but I'm going to see if there's anything I can use to attack with it in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:58:27 - 01:58:28]** You're calling it a Hail Mary.

**[01:58:28 - 01:58:28]** That's what it was.

**[01:58:28 - 01:58:29]** What you did.

**[01:58:29 - 01:58:30]** It really was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:58:31 - 01:58:33]** It was a Jack Sparrow moment.

**[01:58:33 - 01:58:35]** That is, I swear to God, what I was trying to do.

**[01:58:36 - 01:58:41]** But it wasn't even necessary anyway because even when the Pokemon came out, you guys pretty much iced everyone else.

**[01:58:41 - 01:58:42]** So it was fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:58:43 - 01:58:44]** But here's another...

**[01:58:46 - 01:58:50]** But here's another glitch moment that I don't know if any of us really picked it up at the time.

**[01:58:51 - 01:58:54]** We picked up the radio from one of the pirates.

**[01:58:56 - 01:59:06]** And the radios, we did a device check on it and the interface looked normal, but it was only the front interface and it was a dummy interface.

**[01:59:07 - 01:59:08]** It didn't actually work.

**[01:59:08 - 01:59:14]** And we were told that it would work, you know, inner drift communication, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**[01:59:14 - 01:59:16]** But it didn't actually do any of that.

**[01:59:17 - 01:59:19]** It was a gimmick.

**[01:59:19 - 01:59:21]** It was a prop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:59:22 - 01:59:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:59:23 - 01:59:24]** Is that right, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:59:25 - 01:59:31]** Well, I'm not going to say whether it was a gimmick or a prop, but I will say that it didn't do the things that it seemed like it was supposed to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:59:32 - 01:59:33]** Well, it was a prop.

**[01:59:35 - 01:59:42]** Which, for Kevin, that's indication that the pirates are a part of the bigger simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:59:43 - 01:59:46]** What are your thoughts about the relic itself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:59:47 - 01:59:47]** Oh, man.

**[01:59:49 - 01:59:57]** I mean, based on some internal discussions outside of this, not everybody in this group being privy to it, I have some theories that I can't mention.

**[01:59:58 - 02:00:00]** But, like...

**[02:00:00 - 02:00:26]** you can't imagine but in law in large part hopefully something you have your own plot armor is that what you're saying i was just based on a conversation you nick and i had i'm not saying it is that but i'm saying it could be question mark that it could be it could be what you don't you don't want to share i don't know i don't think we should say because but now the way that you're reacting makes me think it might not be we'll bring it up later but um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:00:26 - 02:00:27]** Well, no, now I'm curious.

**[02:00:27 - 02:00:29]** So the relic said it's been removed.

**[02:00:29 - 02:00:30]** Please install.

**[02:00:30 - 02:00:31]** Oh, well, yeah.

**[02:00:32 - 02:00:32]** What happened?

**[02:00:32 - 02:00:33]** And what happened to the ship?

**[02:00:33 - 02:00:38]** Because at some point, the ship starts to shake and rattle and make noises.

**[02:00:39 - 02:00:40]** It's collapsing.

**[02:00:40 - 02:00:42]** Yeah, giant explosions.

**[02:00:42 - 02:00:47]** And we thought the ship was just under attack or it was being destroyed.

**[02:00:48 - 02:00:48]** Yeah.

**[02:00:48 - 02:00:55]** But now that's making me think if the relic was actually like the mainframe or program or whatever.

**[02:00:57 - 02:00:59]** And so when you pulled that out, that caused the ship to collapse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:00:59 - 02:01:02]** I think it was in reality, yeah, that.

**[02:01:02 - 02:01:06]** But I'm wondering why the hell the thing that Rolu gave me glowed near it then or where it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:01:07 - 02:01:10]** Well, that we will find out, I'm sure, in the future.

**[02:01:10 - 02:01:11]** What if Rolu was on it?

**[02:01:11 - 02:01:12]** I think you'll find out.

**[02:01:13 - 02:01:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:01:13 - 02:01:14]** Look, I'll say this.

**[02:01:15 - 02:01:19]** Could it be next time on Will Save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:01:19 - 02:01:20]** You stole my line there, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:01:21 - 02:01:22]** I kind of start to collapse.

**[02:01:23 - 02:01:23]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:01:24 - 02:01:27]** Well, yeah.

**[02:01:27 - 02:01:29]** As Kevin was going to start to say, the ship starts to collapse.

**[02:01:29 - 02:01:33]** We run through a boatload of obstacles, try to find an escape pod.

**[02:01:33 - 02:01:38]** We try to find the docked ship, see if we can hijack that and escape because the ship systems are failing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:01:38 - 02:01:42]** But before that even happened, we had another glitch happen to us in that same cargo bay with the Relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:01:42 - 02:01:45]** Oh, everybody starts to die simultaneously.

**[02:01:45 - 02:01:46]** Everybody dies.

**[02:01:46 - 02:01:47]** They just freeze in place.

**[02:01:47 - 02:01:47]** Without explanation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:01:48 - 02:01:51]** The other pirate, Lozu, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:01:51 - 02:01:53]** They were unplugged from the Matrix.

**[02:01:53 - 02:01:55]** We did life science checks on them, and they were actually dead?

**[02:01:55 - 02:01:56]** They were deceased.

**[02:01:57 - 02:01:58]** Which, the question is, were they ever alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:01:58 - 02:01:59]** Were they biological?

**[02:01:59 - 02:02:01]** We did find that out, right?

**[02:02:01 - 02:02:02]** Like, actual people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:02:03 - 02:02:03]** Yep, they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:02:04 - 02:02:04]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:02:05 - 02:02:08]** Yeah, so the ship starts to collapse.

**[02:02:08 - 02:02:09]** We end up, you know, we leave that room.

**[02:02:09 - 02:02:10]** We run down the hallways.

**[02:02:12 - 02:02:15]** We're splitting into different directions because it's just chaos, right?

**[02:02:15 - 02:02:17]** Like the ship is blowing up.

**[02:02:18 - 02:02:19]** Nick actually goes off.

**[02:02:19 - 02:02:22]** Nico goes off to try to find an escape pod one way.

**[02:02:22 - 02:02:28]** And Rick goes down the other hall to rescue Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:02:28 - 02:02:32]** Well, Nick and I start looking for the ship.

**[02:02:32 - 02:02:34]** Yeah, you saw Professor Benjamin in the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:02:35 - 02:02:38]** And so as Rick is trying to save Professor Benjamin, he's too far gone.

**[02:02:39 - 02:02:40]** His last dying words.

**[02:02:42 - 02:02:45]** My heart will never come home.

**[02:02:45 - 02:02:47]** And Rick had no idea what that meant.

**[02:02:47 - 02:02:48]** And so he's like, I don't know.

**[02:02:48 - 02:02:49]** He said something.

**[02:02:49 - 02:02:50]** This is what he said.

**[02:02:50 - 02:02:51]** And you guys are like, ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:02:52 - 02:02:53]** You stopped in your tracks.

**[02:02:53 - 02:02:53]** Yeah.

**[02:02:53 - 02:02:55]** And then I was like, Nick, try to find the ship.

**[02:02:55 - 02:02:56]** I got to find out.

**[02:02:56 - 02:02:57]** And then I ran back.

**[02:02:58 - 02:02:59]** He was dead.

**[02:02:59 - 02:02:59]** So it's like, damn it.

**[02:03:00 - 02:03:00]** Searched his purse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:03:00 - 02:03:03]** It's like a secret code in a song.

**[02:03:03 - 02:03:04]** Yeah.

**[02:03:05 - 02:03:05]** Is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:03:06 - 02:03:07]** Explanation.

**[02:03:07 - 02:03:09]** We have stuff planned for this.

**[02:03:10 - 02:03:11]** Patience will be required.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:03:12 - 02:03:13]** Again, this doesn't have any questions.

**[02:03:13 - 02:03:16]** This is thoughts I'm having right now because I wasn't making these connections until we had this discussion.

**[02:03:17 - 02:03:17]** The relic.

**[02:03:18 - 02:03:20]** The whole time, Professor Benjamin was telling us to find that relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:03:21 - 02:03:21]** Was he...

**[02:03:21 - 02:03:24]** Because he was actually just trying to tell you to find Algiata the elm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:03:25 - 02:03:26]** No, he's telling us to find the relic.

**[02:03:26 - 02:03:27]** He was worried about the relic.

**[02:03:27 - 02:03:28]** He told us to find the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:03:28 - 02:03:29]** No, wait, hold on.

**[02:03:29 - 02:03:31]** Go back and listen, Jon.

**[02:03:31 - 02:03:32]** No, no, no.

**[02:03:32 - 02:03:38]** He was telling us to go find Algiata because he was afraid that Algiata was going to go steal the relic.

**[02:03:38 - 02:03:40]** It was our... Yeah.

**[02:03:40 - 02:03:48]** It was our assumption that we thought because Algiata was missing, she was going to go steal it, so we were going to go steal it first and protect it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:03:48 - 02:03:50]** But what if the relic... I mean, that...

**[02:03:51 - 02:03:54]** So that means that Professor Benjam is not a part of the simulation.

**[02:03:54 - 02:03:54]** I'll say this.

**[02:03:56 - 02:03:57]** Don't forget what the relic said.

**[02:03:58 - 02:03:58]** Put it back.

**[02:03:59 - 02:04:00]** Reinstall it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:04:01 - 02:04:04]** Which is kind of interesting, but in and of itself.

**[02:04:04 - 02:04:07]** Perhaps if you take Aklo, you should retranslate the message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:04:08 - 02:04:09]** It's interesting.

**[02:04:09 - 02:04:14]** So I think the best thing to do at this point is we finish off the story here.

**[02:04:14 - 02:04:18]** We jump over the fire and we get in the escape pods and we blast off.

**[02:04:18 - 02:04:22]** And as we blast off, we see that we're not a ship really in space.

**[02:04:23 - 02:04:27]** We're a ship kind of connected to all these tubes that's blowing up.

**[02:04:28 - 02:04:31]** And it's like a simulation that's going kind of faulty.

**[02:04:31 - 02:04:33]** But we find ourselves in a big, big room.

**[02:04:34 - 02:04:36]** And that's kind of where we end ourselves here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:04:36 - 02:04:45]** So here's the secret sauce is that not only is the ship blowing up, but the vast chamber around it is also falling apart.

**[02:04:46 - 02:04:48]** There are screens that are displaying images of space.

**[02:04:48 - 02:04:50]** These screens are busted, right?

**[02:04:51 - 02:04:52]** And you can only see three of the walls.

**[02:04:52 - 02:04:54]** The fourth wall is just darkness.

**[02:04:55 - 02:04:59]** And so your escape pods jettison off into that abyss.

**[02:04:59 - 02:05:23]** and it's uh it's kind of crazy it's kind of crazy for sure so last question here as we come to the end of our arbitrarily timed bonus episode in as few words as possible or just quickly here what did you think of book one did you enjoy it did you enjoy it as a player you know were the things about it that you wish were different what are your thoughts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:05:23 - 02:05:29]** What I feel about book one is that I'm going to enjoy it a lot better after we play book two.

**[02:05:30 - 02:05:33]** That much I am absolutely 100% positive of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:05:34 - 02:05:36]** Did you enjoy it while you were playing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:05:37 - 02:05:40]** It took a little bit to get into, but you know what?

**[02:05:40 - 02:05:41]** I did enjoy it.

**[02:05:41 - 02:05:41]** You can say no.

**[02:05:41 - 02:05:42]** No, no, no.

**[02:05:42 - 02:05:44]** I'm giving you my honest reaction.

**[02:05:44 - 02:05:45]** It took a while to get into it.

**[02:05:47 - 02:05:52]** And John, you and I had our conversations like in the first 10 episodes, how I was feeling about the book.

**[02:05:53 - 02:06:00]** But by the end, it really felt like everything started speeding up to actually, oh, wow, okay, there's something really screwed up here.

**[02:06:00 - 02:06:02]** Now we're really going to get into the weeds of it.

**[02:06:03 - 02:06:11]** And I feel after book two, all of us are going to achieve a level of clarity that's going to make us look back on book one, and we're going to be like, oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:06:12 - 02:06:16]** I mean, that's how I feel looking back on like episode one with this stuff.

**[02:06:16 - 02:06:22]** Like there's so much and it's that's one of my things with book one is there's so much more we could have explored.

**[02:06:22 - 02:06:23]** Like we never got to talk to Keith.

**[02:06:23 - 02:06:25]** We never got to talk to Dr. Benjamin.

**[02:06:25 - 02:06:30]** But all these events start rolling and it's kind of bittersweet because like.

**[02:06:30 - 02:06:38]** That intensity, that rush of we have to move on and discover this before something else happens and something else happens.

**[02:06:40 - 02:06:42]** But at the same time, we didn't have enough time to explore.

**[02:06:43 - 02:06:45]** And that's kind of my video game background.

**[02:06:45 - 02:06:53]** I walk rooms from left to right and want to look at everything and check all the loot and all that stuff.

**[02:06:53 - 02:06:56]** You don't have that opportunity in this game, which I think is good.

**[02:06:56 - 02:06:59]** I think that really is part of good storytelling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:06:59 - 02:07:04]** Well, you also have to balance, you have to balance like your time and your resources, right?

**[02:07:05 - 02:07:11]** Because you could be somewhere all day and then be missing something behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:07:11 - 02:07:23]** I'm like Kevin, where I'm a completionist with video games, and this was a little bit frustrating for that reason, but it is kind of cool that you have to balance it.

**[02:07:23 - 02:07:28]** I have regret for it, but at the same time, it's kind of awesome because I'm like, oh, wow, what if I did this?

**[02:07:28 - 02:07:29]** What if I did that?

**[02:07:29 - 02:07:32]** Your choices really are time-consuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:07:32 - 02:08:00]** sensitive and they matter a lot and a lot more than our dnd campaign i feel that about this and even in spite of the fact that you're in a small space it's so fast paced which was awesome i agree yeah and imagine too that you didn't go to investigate algae out of his room and instead he said hey let's go check on let's go check on keeve imagine how differently the story would have developed well that's what i was gonna say because like john's actually talked to other gms that have run the threefold conspiracy or is running

**[02:08:00 - 02:08:22]** they are running whatever um and they've gotten through book one and the way that their book one went was completely different than the way that we played it wow that's kind of cool yeah it's totally different because i've heard stories where other players will bring npcs into a room and then they'll investigate then they'll do all these other things and honestly i have to credit

**[02:08:22 - 02:08:42]** the incredible writers at paizo and jason keely for essentially saying hey this is a sandbox here are the pieces that you need to have your players enjoy a great experience and really dig into this game and get into the mystery

**[02:08:42 - 02:08:50]** And Nick brings up a good perspective, which is that sometimes, you know, each book and adventure has its own cadence, its own pace.

**[02:08:50 - 02:08:53]** And so you as the player, you might feel immersed immediately.

**[02:08:54 - 02:08:55]** It might take you time to get into it.

**[02:08:55 - 02:09:00]** But as a GM, you can customize this already great structure and story.

**[02:09:00 - 02:09:01]** You can customize it in little ways.

**[02:09:01 - 02:09:07]** So, for instance, the inciting incident with Magwa and LaRue, you know, I wrote that in.

**[02:09:07 - 02:09:11]** So then that way you guys could have sort of a climactic beginning to bring you in.

**[02:09:12 - 02:09:12]** Anyway.

**[02:09:12 - 02:09:13]** Let's wrap up.

**[02:09:13 - 02:09:16]** Kelly, Will, what are your thoughts?

**[02:09:16 - 02:09:16]** It's great.

**[02:09:16 - 02:09:17]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:09:17 - 02:09:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:09:17 - 02:09:18]** Super fun.

**[02:09:19 - 02:09:20]** I love the mystery.

**[02:09:21 - 02:09:26]** Yeah, it was fun getting to know all the different parts of this mystery.

**[02:09:26 - 02:09:41]** The moving parts behind it are still yet to be revealed, but the cogs, so to speak, little samples here and there throughout were really fun.

**[02:09:41 - 02:09:41]** I agree, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:09:41 - 02:09:46]** I really like that pace a lot, that element of this, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:09:48 - 02:09:48]** Yeah.

**[02:09:48 - 02:09:53]** I think two things I'd like to bring up was the fact that we'd never used darkvision.

**[02:09:53 - 02:09:56]** And I know John's like, oh, we'll use it in the future.

**[02:09:57 - 02:10:01]** But the fact that ship went dark, I think we could have played into the mystery a little bit more.

**[02:10:02 - 02:10:04]** Um, I would have only really limited Nico.

**[02:10:04 - 02:10:05]** Cause I think he's the only one that doesn't have dark vision.

**[02:10:06 - 02:10:10]** I think it would have just changed a little bit of the, the atmosphere, I think to have to like work with that.

**[02:10:11 - 02:10:16]** Um, and then the other thing was, and we've talked about this is that, that final scene where we're running out of the ship.

**[02:10:17 - 02:10:22]** Um, if we could have done that in like role play, it would be, you know, take turns initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:10:22 - 02:10:22]** Yeah.

**[02:10:23 - 02:10:23]** Yeah.

**[02:10:23 - 02:10:23]** I totally agree.

**[02:10:23 - 02:10:25]** I think those are things that we will bring up.

**[02:10:26 - 02:10:41]** next time until then this is the end nick the music started you want to take us out find out what happens next time on we'll say yes love it nice bye everyone
