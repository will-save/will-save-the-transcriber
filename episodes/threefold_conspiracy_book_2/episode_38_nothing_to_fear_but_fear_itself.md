## Speaker_0

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:13]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:03]** All right, I came prepared this time.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:07]** Came prepared with poles.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Most dangerous game.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Most dangerous weapon.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** Poles.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** You guys ready?

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** I'm just going to fire them off.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** Don't even say anything.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** Don't say it.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Choose, Office or Parks and Rec?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** Office.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Parks and Rec.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Two for Office.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** I'm Office.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Will says Parks and Rec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Kev?

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** You guys are going to be so mad at me for this one.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** You don't like either of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:35]** I thought that I don't like them.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** It's just I've never actually seen them.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Ah, that's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:42]** You've got to choose, though, if you got locked in a room.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** I don't watch TV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:48]** Parks and Rec, I'd probably choose Parks and Rec over Office.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Parks and Rec?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Okay.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** All right.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Okay.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** So it sounds like we're Office winners.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** It's 3-2.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** All right.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Moving on.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** 30 Rock Big Bang Theory.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Oh, 30 Rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** I hate the Big Bang Theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** I also hate the Big Bang Theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** 30 Rock, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** It's a nerd show for people who don't know who the nerds are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Yeah, they have no idea what they're talking about.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** They'll just be like, Thundercats, right?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** Ha ha, ha ha, that's the entire joke.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Thundercats, oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Wow, we're nerds.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Look at us.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** I feel like there are a lot of people who just heard that.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Us all.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** And they all just turned off and never listened to us again.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** I'm sorry people that immediately turned off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:31]** My dad, who's a listener, loves Big Bang Theory, by the way.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** And he's a physicist.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** I know.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:38]** Just for Michael, who's sure, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** You could be a physicist and not be a nerd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** It's true.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Your dad, like, not nerdy at all.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:48]** He's just, like, killing deer every day and doing cool shit like that.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** He's doing cool, cool, cool physics stuff every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:59]** He learned physics so he could play shots really well when hunting deer.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Yeah, because he's an actor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** He called shots, like, in that one movie.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** What's that movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** What's that movie?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** Yeah.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** All right.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** Next.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Friends, Seinfeld.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** Seinfeld.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Obviously.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** Friends.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** Yeah, Seinfeld.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Seinfeld.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Seinfeld.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Ken, do you like Friends?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Over Seinfeld?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** You're giving me some really weird choices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** I don't know.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** I'm really actually on the fence.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** I haven't watched all of Seinfeld, but I've watched all of Friends.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** Okay.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** There's some classic Seinfeld movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Next.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Moving on.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** Brooklyn Nine-Nine, It's Always Sunny.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Brooklyn Nine-Nine, flat out.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** That's the one show I'll just stand behind out of everything you've listed so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:44]** I haven't seen either, but I prefer Brooklyn Nine-Nine probably, or whatever it's called, Nine-Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** But you've never seen The Office, so what's your frame of reference?


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** I don't know.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Nick, did you give an answer?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** I haven't seen either one of them, so I can't give an answer.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** I'm not entitled to an answer on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:08]** There are some great Always Sunny moments, but... Moments, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** Like, the show itself is not that grand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:14]** Yeah, I really like Brooklyn Nine-Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Brooklyn Nine-Nine's, like, solid storyline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Except for the portal stuff, which is a little weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I've never seen either, so I don't know.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** What?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I don't know.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Why are you asking us questions then, John?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:31]** Why aren't you giving us TV hot or not?

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** Hot or not, yeah, I mean, that's the game that we just played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** We're clearly all movie folks, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** Yeah, clearly all, yeah, that's what we do.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** We just watch movies all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Let's talk about books.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I've seen almost no movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Books.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Books.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** Can't believe you didn't even include How I Met Your Mother in that.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** Oh, let's do books.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** Yeah, that'd be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** How I Met Your Mother.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** I mean, next time.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** But we can ask that next time.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** We'll just mix genres.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Yeah, there won't be a next time.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Okay, here, last one.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Last one, Kev.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** Game of Thrones or How I Met Your Mother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Game of Thrones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Game of Thrones, definitely.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** How much do I hate the creators?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:12]** That's a whole separate intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Why do you hate the creators?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** I'm not going to comment.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Let's go into it.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Yeah, I get that.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** This is the interview segment of our podcast.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** Our guest, Will, who is on We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Why do you hate the creators of Game of Thrones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** Not for botching up... The last season?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** I mean, nothing.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:40]** They're genuinely great human beings, and I applaud them for all of their efforts and their talent, immense talent.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** I have nothing to say further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:50]** I mean, you can be critical of their final season and how it didn't live up to the hype of the rest of the series, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** Who are you talking about?

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** It's confusing.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Are you talking about Game of Thrones or are you talking about How I Met Your Mother?

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** Do they both end just horribly?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** Just atrophy at the end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Yeah.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** The last episode for How I Met Your Mother wasn't great.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** Do you want the spoiler?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** It's all Game of Thrones, but not How I Met Your Mother all the way through.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Oh, yeah, sure.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** You can spoil it for me.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** We shouldn't spoil it for other people, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** No, yeah.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** We can't spoil it for other people.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Speaking of spoilers, did I tell you?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** So I'm reading Harry Potter.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:39]** and I'm like three quarters of the way through the very last book of the very last of the entire series and I have gone 20 years without learning enough about Harry Potter to get any of the big spoilers and I was reading a gif or a meme on Facebook that a friend posted

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:43]** And it was the whole like, you know, the wife is leaned over and she's like, he's probably thinking about another man.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** And then it cuts to the man's thoughts.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:52]** And the man's thoughts are spoiler, spoiler, spoiler that I've never heard in my entire life that basically ruined the entire book for me.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** And I'm not going to say the spoiler is on.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** So, you know, save anybody else who wants to read Harry Potter, which is actually a pretty good book series.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** That's so good.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Without the spoiler.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** Like if I told you what the spoiler was, you guys would be like, oh, my God.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** How irate were you?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** I was pretty mad.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** The fact that this happened, like, four days ago, and I'm still, like, irritated by it.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:21]** Because now I'm reading the book going, like, oh, man, like, I know what's going to happen, and I know, like, it explains, like, everything that happened up to this point.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:26]** Like, all the way back to, like, the opening pages of the first book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** I'm like... He was so close, too.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** You were so close.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** You almost made it to the finish line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:35]** Like, if I would have seen a spoiler, like, I don't know, two years ago when I started reading this book series, I probably wouldn't even remember.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** But...

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** It happened this close to the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:45]** It's like at the forefront of your mind and you haven't quite read the big reveal in the book yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** I mean, I was like literally three chapters away from the reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Wow.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** That's sad.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** I would be so pissed off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** You were Nancy Kerrigan and that meme was Tanya Harding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Yeah.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Baseball bat to the ankle.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Not too soon at all.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Not in poor taste.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:07]** Isn't that like a 90s ice skater reference or something?

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** Yeah.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Olympic silver.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Someone like beat out her knees.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** She paid off.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** One skater paid off some thugs to break the other skaters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** There's a bunch of documentaries and TV shows and stuff on it on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** The movie Tanya is actually pretty good.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** I think it's Margot Robbie.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Yeah.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** It's a great movie.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** She's a talented actress.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** Cool.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** Speaking of poor transitions, you guys want to play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Yeah.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Yes.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Breaking ankles.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** Nico.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Speaking of breaking ankles, that's bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Because John's about to miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Wait, what?

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Nothing.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Okay.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** All right.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** So.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** So.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** Last time, you guys got a taste of...

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** of violence?

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** No, not violence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** It was pretty violent.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Magnetic goo in our face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** Well, you got a taste of, yeah, a lot of things.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** But here's the thing.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:16]** You specifically got a taste of the terrible moral and ethical disposition, not just last time, a few episodes ago, of the grays, right?

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:28]** As you came across an arrogant gray looking to use your rather simple brains and cerebral cortexes to help analyze and channel data

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** into their data foundry.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:41]** You defeat him in combat as he tried to subdue you, forcing you into a deep sleep and then possibly worse.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:51]** So this alone already puts you in the small circle of individuals to recall meeting a gray, let alone killing one.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:59]** Pushing on, you enter a chamber, half demolished, looking like some sort of a checkpoint.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:07]** The desk has been turned to rubble and all that remains is just this curious machine on the wall and another door on the other side.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:19]** But then bounding out of the corner comes this feral gray known as a gray bounder who swiftly puts you in your place, forcing retreat back into the data foundry.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:37]** Now, exhausted, nerves frayed, beaten back, you decide to risk the threat on the other side of the door and risk the ever-present structural quakes that strike to take a long rest.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:45]** You're plagued by strange dream recollections of your memories, different from what you know.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:52]** And waking up, you decide to keep looking to the doors in the north on the other side of that central hub.

**[00:10:52 - 00:11:01]** And you find yourself in a corridor with a large debris of rock that's fallen from the ceiling.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:10]** Now out of the floor comes this, this Pharaoh fluid ooze to attack you and it attaches itself to Dr. Okay.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:18]** And I have to say something real quick before we jump back in, because that's where we left off before we jump back into the combat.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** And I have to say that.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** The last combat, I messed up something with the Trollpollop and the Regeneration, right?

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** That was... Sorry, three combats ago.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:36]** This time, I caught something about the Ferrofluid Ooze that I messed up, which is that...

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** you would have noticed, Dr.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:50]** O.K., that after your attack that dealt five points of damage, technically, all of the damage shouldn't have gone through all the way, as if it had some sort of damage resistance.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** And that happened last episode.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:58]** My hand's kind of off the chest piece, so that damage, the damage it took, is the damage it's going to take.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** But...

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** You also did a life science check.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** You noticed that it had a resistance five electricity.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:13]** So in general, we haven't worked or we haven't like fought many creatures with regeneration or D.R.,

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:21]** So this creature clearly has some sort of DR. I'm going to tell you from your life science check that it is for piercing and slashing.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:33]** How it works in Starfinder, how DR works in Starfinder is that it specifies the damage to which the creature will not have DR.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:44]** So I thought it was the other way around like it is in other popular game systems where it's the case that those are the only things that it has DR. In this, it's the other way.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:49]** So anything except piercing and slashing will have a damage resistance to it.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Resistances work the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:57]** So it says it has a DR of electricity, and that means that it is weak against electricity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** No, you're thinking of it how I was thinking of it before.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** DR, it has DR to piercing and slashing.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** And I'm just telling you because you did a life science check.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** I feel like that would have come out if I had thought of it the right way.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Just going to give it to you.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** It's fine.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** It has a DR to piercing and slashing.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:21]** Any damage that is not piercing and slashing will have the, like not all the damage will go through unless it's piercing and slashing.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Then that will all go through.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:32]** Now, resistance means any damage is fine, but specifically electricity damage will have some of it taken off, not all of it will go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** Wait, so what does DR stand for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Damage resistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** So it has a resistance to electricity.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Sorry, damage reduction.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** Damage reduction to piercing and slashing, this creature does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:47]** No, damage reduction to everything except piercing and slashing.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** That's what I'm trying to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Sorry, can you read the phrase exactly what it says?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** Here, let me give another example.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:04]** For example, DR5 slash cold iron means that you take five fewer damage from the weapons that are not made from cold iron.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:17]** So DR blank piercing and slashing means that you will take that amount damage less from damage or weapons that are not piercing and slashing.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Man, that's confusing.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** That's why I got... The phrasing is weird.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Yeah, it's the opposite of what you think.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:28]** And the thing is that in other systems, it is how you would normally think, like how resistances work.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** Anyway, didn't mean to bring this to a screeching halt.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Stop everything.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Stop the presses.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Stop the presses.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** I just wanted to let you know what was going on.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** And with that, we need to jump back into combat.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** And I believe, unless you have any questions, I do.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:51]** So I got the damage reduction to everything except piercing and slashing, but how does this relate to electricity again?

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:55]** It also has damage reduction, extra DR to that, or what was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:04]** It has resistance electricity, which means that to electricity damage specifically, like your Electrovor, it would not all go through.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Okay, so...

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** But it already has resistance to electricity because the DR is only for slashing.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** So is it stacked in some way?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:18]** So the damage reduction only works... My understanding of damage reduction is that it only works with kinetic damage.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** So it's not energy damage.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** The resistance covers the energy damage.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** The damage reduction covers kinetic.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** So bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** I'm going to go look this up.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** You do that.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** But while you do that... Yeah, play on.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Play on.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Carry on, carry on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:44]** While you do that, we are going to jump in and give me one.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:51]** We ended last time with the fair fluid ooze.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Attaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Attaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** So, Doctor, okay, I'm going to move you guys over on roll 20.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:02]** And it is going to be... That was the end of its turn.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** It is Rick19's turn.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Unfortunate, because he's still looking at the book.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** That means that he forfeits his turn automatically.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** And we're going to move on to the next person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** Starfinder, cool mistress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Cruel mistress.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Well, let's just clarify again.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** So I have a giant laser cannon.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Yeah.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** If I shoot this thing with my giant laser cannon, does that go through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** It's fire damage.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** 100%.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** according to this damage thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:34]** Yeah, I mean, so if it's the energy damage, it will go through.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** If it's electricity, it would not go through all of the way.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** Okay.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** Sorry, where is this thing at on the map?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:45]** It's so dark, but my dark vision lets me see it, so...

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** It looks like it's a part of the walls.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** So Rick is within reach of this thing.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** So he is actually going to do a guarded step back towards Nico.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** No, I took that back because it's right here.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** If I move, then I have to shoot through.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** Give me a wisdom check.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Wisdom?

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** What does wisdom have to do with shooting things?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** 16 plus zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:12]** 16.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** 16.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:19]** That's just enough to know that because it's attached, from the way that it looks, because it's attached to Dr.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** O.K.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:26]** 's slug body, you would know that it cannot make attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** Then you just, I'm going to do full attack and shoot twice.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** Are we going to damage Dr. O.K.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** though?

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Like, is there a chance to damage him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:41]** I mean, well, so when they're attached, they already get a bonus to AC.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** I think, yeah.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Oh, it's A to AC.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** That's huge.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** No, no.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** I didn't say A. A bonus to AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Okay, okay.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** But we're not going to harm whoever they're attached to, hopefully.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I don't think you would.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** off of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** Alright, I'm going to play a little trick with my dice.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:02]** Since one dice usually rolls low and I have two sets out, I'm going to roll both my d20s at the same time.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** Nice.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** I'm going to shoot twice.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Okay.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** I like it.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** Dang.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** They both rolled pretty low.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Okay, so I got a 9 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** For 1, so that's 13 points.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:17]** And then I have a 13 plus 4, which is 17.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** So a 13 and a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** A 13 and a 17 against EAC?

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** EAC.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** E-A-C.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:32]** The first attack misses, leaves a sizzling, fiery scorch mark in the floor.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:38]** The second attack hits the ferrofluid ooze.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** So I only get one hit.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** That is awesome.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** What's up?

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Yeah, you got one hit.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:47]** But that one hit is a D10 plus three of fire damage.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** D10 plus three.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:49]** Gross.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** From that D10, I rolled a one.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** So it's got four points of fire damage.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Four points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:01]** Not a lot, but for some reason, with the fire, you hear like...

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:14]** As the ooze itself starts to unattach from Dr. OK, because the fire damage seems to demagnetize the creature.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:19]** And so Dr. OK and the creature are no longer attached.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Yay.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Free of this thing.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Let's put it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:28]** Everyone, it appears that fire damage negates its magnetic abilities.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** I've got a cocktail for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** Fluid.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** Here's.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** It is your turn.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** Unless, Rick, you wanted to pull out your core rule book and start looking after you shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:46]** That was my full action was to shoot, and now I'm going back to the core rule book to read about damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Okay, so Rick opens up a book.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** No, Kevin opens the book.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Rick's still holding his gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Here's.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** That's funny.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** All right.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** Here's is going to fire some magic missiles at the goo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:03]** Here's is going to fire some magic missiles at the goo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** I like it.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** Um, actually here's instead.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Uh, so there's this rock here.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** Um, 10, 15.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:17]** Would I be able to like shoot past this rock and attack or will it get, does it have cover from that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:21]** Yeah, so there's a giant boulder that fell from the ceiling.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** You're standing right next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** Yeah, so if I wanted to go here.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Oh, yeah, go on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:26]** I can't.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** You have line of sight to the creature.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** I don't think it would have any cover from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** Okay, here's goes here and he's going to roll.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:37]** He's going to do a overheat, which deals fire damage, but it's not a guaranteed hit.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** So hopefully this works well.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** This works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** Oh, wait, you're going back over there.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** I think that's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** Yeah.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** All right, cool.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:52]** Because the thing is, it's like a cone-shaped damage, and it's like a 15-foot range, so I don't want to get anyone in that cone.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** So this should be far enough where it's okay just to hit him.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:03]** Okay, so here's does that, and that is... What do we see?

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** All right, so one second.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Here's takes out his die.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** It's like 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Here's takes out his D20.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** I'm just going to roll it.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Getting ready to roll.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** Here's just not the time for dice.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Fuck.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** It's like a 10 to attack, right?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** So I guess that doesn't work.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** It's an attack roll against a TAC.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** Yeah.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** I don't do that.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** What am I talking about?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** It's a DC 16.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** DC 16 what?

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Yeah.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** Spell DC reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Reflex save.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Got it.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Okay.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** So it has to hit a DC 16 reflex save.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** It says reflex half.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** Yeah.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Reflex for half damage.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Got it.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Can it make the save?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** This gooey ooey ooze.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Come on, you gooey bastard.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** Makes me think of Ivan Ooze from Power Rangers.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** That is a 13.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Failed the save.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Going to take full damage.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** That away.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Fantastic.

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** Awesome.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:03]** As this like the air shimmers with heat.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** I'm sure that Dr. OK and Rick are both standing right there in front of it because Nico cowardly jumped back with the jump jets.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:17]** So Dr. OK and Rick feel this like heat coming off like you're standing next to hot asphalt in the desert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** Nick, that's from the GM, not from the other players.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** That was a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:31]** No, no, but you guys are going to feel a little cold because this heat is coming from your bodies.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** So apologies ahead of time.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** It gets sucked in from people and devices.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** So it comes from all of your bodies and Nick's little jet boots.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** So I just let this heat get sucked into here as he blasts it out.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:45]** And that's a 2d8 fire damage.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** So I'm just going to do that real quick.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Yeah.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Just going to do a little fire damn real quick.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** You know.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** It's 16 damage.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** 16?

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Of fire as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** 16 damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** Holy cow.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** That's toasty.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** You want to know what?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** I'm enjoying this.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Yes.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** It had 16 HP left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** It dies.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Nice.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Good job, Kelly.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** That was impressive.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** Nico did absolutely nothing.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** He just ran away.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** It's all right, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:29]** I mean, to be honest, I probably would do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:33]** I have, what, seven hit points left and 18 stamina?

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** I could have been a new... That was a smart thing to do, I think.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** Yeah, because we had the drop on it.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** We could have had the drop on it and tagged first and taken it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** Okay, fly boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** This thing had the drop on me.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** I was exposed out in the open and I was just sole target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** This isn't the first time that you guys have just walked randomly into rooms and gotten yourself into trouble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** That's true.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** I was listening to another episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:05]** In fact, it was only like three episodes ago that you almost got killed from

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Whatever.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:11]** I made a strategic withdrawal and drew him out into the open and killed him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Close, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Yeah, you ran in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Yeah, I think you did the right thing.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:20]** I also run away from being right up next to things.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:23]** I've seen what happens in this campaign when you're right next to things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** I don't have to run away because I cautiously proceed.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Correct.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** So I never get close enough to have to run away.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:38]** The problem is that the narrative doesn't work for you, Rick, because you cautiously proceeded into that room and that gray bounder.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** took out half your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** Yeah, but that's because the rest of my team ran away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** What?

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** No, we didn't.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** Nico's like, oh, I'm so sorry.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** I touched the door control and it shut and locked.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** I'm sorry.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** It's revenge.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Too bad.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Sorry.

**[00:24:54 - 00:25:02]** Alright, so this gooey ooze gets cooked alive as it just starts to...

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:07]** And then this becomes a puddle of tar on the ground.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** And you all are standing in this corridor.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** Massive rock to the west.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** These red complex lines all around you.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** And two doors.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** One to the one both on the north side of the wall.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** One on the left, one on the right.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Looks like there's three doors.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Well, there's three.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** There's one that go back into the central room.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Two unopened doors.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** I'll say.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Okay.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** The air feels cool.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:43]** You still feel the quake from random vibrations, but the air feels cool because all of your skin has just been now.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** You are cold and there's just the normal sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** I rolled an 18 for perception on the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** 18 for perception on the room.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:14]** I think that's enough to know that the same as in the other room, the other corridor to the south, you find a hidden hatch containing 500 UPVs, a Mark II culinary synthesizer that's built into the wall.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** And that's it.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** Okay.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:24]** You could remove the synthesizer, and you can take the UPBs, but if you want to remove it, you got to finagle it.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** You got to roll a check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** I'll do that.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:30]** I'll go ahead and disable it and remove it.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Engineering or computers, or can it be both?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Engineering.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Engineering?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** I'll assist with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Here's assists.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** I got a 20 for my assist.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Okay, so plus two.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** One second from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** I got an 18 for my assist, so plus two.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** 27 assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** So 27.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** That's an 18 on the natural.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** That's an 18 with the modifier.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** And then you had plus six, I think, from everyone else, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** Everybody looking over your shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** Use that wire there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Not that wire.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** Wrong wire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** I swear, if I was having to disassemble with everybody over my shoulder at once, I would fucking lose my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** You know what would happen?

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Not here.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Here's just giving you a shoulder rub.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** Here, use this little doohickey I made.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Nick, you would probably get overwhelmed.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Hit your jump jets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** Fly out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** You know what?

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** I did the right thing.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** You guys can give me all the shit you want.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** I agree you did the right thing.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I'm on your side.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Yes.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Surrender now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** It doesn't take you too long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:50]** About 30 seconds, you're able to pull out the culinary, Mark II culinary synthesizer, and you are able to keep it in a functional state.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:56]** So if you need it to use it to make food or whatever else that it can make, then you're good to go.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** And you have the 500 UPPs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:04]** Not to make things harder for us, John, but how does food and eating work in Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:12]** It's a very good question that I will think about and I will tell you at some point off air or maybe next episode.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** Because I just need to let my brain go back in the recesses.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Not because I don't know it.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Definitely not because I don't know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** That's the coward's way out, John.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Use your jump jets.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Get out of the conversation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** You can't just jump jet away from all your problems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** Anyway.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Yes, I can.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Fucking watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Yes, I can.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Food's not even in the index.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** John, give me an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:47]** Food's not even in the index of the Colville book, so I don't think it matters in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Does it matter in Pathfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** So the culinary synthesizer is in the armory, page 129.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** No, I'm looking up just food in general, John.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:59]** Okay, but I'm going to go to the armory and go to page 129 real quick because you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Starships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** It's fine.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** We have an hour-long podcast.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** We can just take whatever time we want.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** It's only been half the show already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:12]** It's been about 30 minutes.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** R2 Culinary Synthesizer.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** This marvel of modern culinary preparation is a small cube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:25]** Thank you for this fantastic opportunity to plug our culinary sponsor.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Take it away, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:33]** Have you ever had to grill something and the grill was just too large?

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Leg of my ego.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Wrong.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** You know what you use for that echo?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** George Foreman grills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Thank you, George Foreman.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** I kind of picture this device as a George Foreman grill.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:57]** It is a small cube with a hatch on one side and a panel on the other that can cook almost anything.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** It takes UPBs and it makes meals.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** It doesn't cook.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** It synthesizes.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** It synthesizes.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** Mark two, you can create up to common quality meals, minor intoxicants.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Intoxicants?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** Or any food or drink with a price of two credits or less.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** TM, George Foreman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** So what are the rules behind it?

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:26]** I mean, we know what it does, but I mean... Yeah, that I will have to look and get back to you.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:34]** Well, actually, the reason why I ask is there's a really cool Skyrim mod that you had to eat.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:48]** If you weren't eating, you would start taking massive and stacking punishments to your... Nick, if you wanted to implement that rule that you take massive damage when you don't eat...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:48 - 00:31:16]** happy to do that only only nick not massive damage i was just thinking he's the only human the rest of us have like abilities to like that's that's exactly what i'm thinking all the rest of your biologies are fine humans though yeah so the humans have to eat the rest of us can i like the idea i i'm not disagreeing nick about it being a good idea i just mean it would suck if your resolve points get nommed up by hunger but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** I'm just saying John is... I mean, I agree, Kelly.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:27]** I'm just saying John's acting like this food processor that George Foreman has created for us in the future is this end-all, be-all.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** We need this in the future.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** And there's no rule whatsoever that says that we have to eat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** There is a rule.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** There's probably a reason.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** There's probably a rule.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** I'm looking for it.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** And don't worry.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** We're going to throw it on our Discord and J3.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** I'm calling them J3 from now on.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** Jeff, Jeremy, and Joe.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** They'll let us know if we're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Yep, that's very true.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** J-Squad.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** That's true.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** We can always rely on them.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** J-Squad.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Yeah, we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** And if you're not on the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Shout out to the Rules Lawyer Defense Team.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** Join our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Rules Lawyer Defense Team.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** Part of the firm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Go to our Twitter.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:05]** And in the Twitter profile, you'll find the tab link and then get the Discord from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:13]** If you have any thoughts about the Mark II Colonial Synthesizer or any part of Starfinder or our podcast or how Nick can't jump jet out of hunger, please let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** Nice try to deflect back to me there, John.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Nice try.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** It was very nimble, just like you when you jumped at it out of the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Roll a d20, John.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Let's see if it works.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** I know that I would succeed.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** Let's move on.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** You're standing in this hallway, the four of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:37]** We should take a look and see what fiendish things are behind these doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** Yeah, that's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:49]** I just want to review that we found two rooms, and one of those rooms had the device that you guys had researched on the computer, correct?

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** So that means that these other two rooms are possibly the other...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:53 - 00:33:15]** technologies that they listed i agree let's be really careful opening these doors and going in we don't want to make a we don't want to make the mistake we just made again and i suggest that we perceive the room before entering and he looks directly at nico actually that was also my fault let's do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** And then he scans the other two.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** Piercing vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Which one you want to open up first?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** Is one to your left, Tidman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** If you sensed it with this dark sense, your shade, blind sense, or whatever it is.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** All right.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** Roll in perception on the room.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** It's seven, so forget that.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Wait, sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** You open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, yeah, wait, wait.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Which room are you guys going to go to?

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Talking through it.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** I see this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yeah.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** So there's two doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** The door to the left.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** There's like a door to the left, door to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** The one with the boulder nearby.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** You duck behind the boulder for some cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** Rick will go stand next to the other door with his gun ready.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:05]** That way, if he recognizes there's trouble and it's a single room, he can open the door and engage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** John, do we know what this red light is?

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Is it just lighting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** I think it's similar to the other room, right?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** It's just kind of like... Yeah, it's just kind of like boot lighting.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Well, no, no.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:31]** So the red and the blue, if you recall, those are like these complex diagrams that point to how mechanically things are working in the rooms slash in the central hub.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** So it's like...

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** it is showing where things are going.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** It's like looking at pipes and conduits that are there, but it's, but it's all these elaborate markings.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** It would take you a long time to decode them.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:48]** Whereas it hasn't taken you too long to work through glyphs, things like that, especially now that you know, this is like a very specialized design.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Okay.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Clearly some sort of technical space.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** I'll say.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Yeah.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:03]** So, Nico's going to have his blaster ready to go, and he's also going to draw his dueling sword.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** He's going to look over, and he's going to be like, well, that one had me jumping out of my feet there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** Try not to jump out of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** Sounds like I walked out of our first combat.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** Yeah, but I got more help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:26]** I'm just going to look glassy-eyed at Nico.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Nico's going to respond back to Dr. Okay.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Nice comeback there, Slick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Oh, nice.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Slug buns.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:40]** Just call me Slimeball next time, Flyboy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** All right.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** All right, kids.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Let's go.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:48]** Don't get salty on me there, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** Don't you threaten me with salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Who's threatening who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Salt?

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** This offends me.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:02]** Anyway, let's do this, okay?

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Get out of here.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** I'm going to have my syringe spear at the ready with my costa jet in the other hand.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** Okay, so Dr. K, syringe spear ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:18]** And here's Reddy's magic missile, and I guess we're going to open this door, so he's also going to roll stealth.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Okay, going to roll stealth.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** Are you going to open the door for me?

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:29]** Because I have to roll stealth to open it.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** I got a 17.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** 17?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** And here's your opening the door for Dr. Okay?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** I mean, we can't stealthily open doors here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Because they're Star Trek doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** Yeah, they just opened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** So he's just going to... Yeah.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** So he's just going to open the door for a doctor.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** And then, Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Sorry.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** So I'm also doing a stealth role just to be silent on the other side of the door.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Nice.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** So that was natural 20 plus 9 for a 29.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Yeah.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** You are stealthy.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** Rick, you got your big laser gun ready?

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Very stealthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Big laser gun ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** All right.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** So...

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** So what's happening?

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** So you're opening the left door, you're not opening the right door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:16]** Not opening the right door unless something attacks them on that side and it's clear that there is a divider.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:23]** So Rick will tell them again, like, if there is danger, indicate whether I can open this door and get involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Will do.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Here's nods.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** Okay.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:30]** As soon as the door opens, I'm going to perceive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** Okay.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** Okay.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:38]** Do you want to just roll that and then tell me so I can let you know what you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** My ears will do that too.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** 22.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** 22, 25.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Okay.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:50]** Hmm, interesting.

**[00:37:51 - 00:38:03]** So you push the door open here, or you push the keypad, and Dr. Okay, the door opens in front of you.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:15]** As it opens, picture spinning purple lights in the ceiling, illuminating this room a couple feet at a time, creating these leaping shadows.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:29]** Four clear cylinders form a sort of uneven row along the center of the chamber, each with complex machinery connecting it to the floor and the paneled ceiling.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:34]** The second tube from the western wall is broken.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:39]** Shards of the tube, the clear material scattered around it.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** Several workstations with computer terminals and chairs stand in the room.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** Most show no signs of power and function at all.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:57]** But the terminals at the western edge emit light from their holographic viewscreens, which have weird symbols.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:06]** And there's just this door in front of you, which allows entrance or exit.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Now Dr. O'Key adheres.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** As the door opens, two things happen.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:23]** Something in your psyche feels very compelled to be very afraid.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:32]** It kind of starts to overwhelm your feelings, but it's like when you're nauseous, but you're trying to put it down, like you feel it in your gut.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:36]** You're like, this is, I'm not right.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** There's not something.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** I have a bad feeling about this.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** And Dr.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** O.K., you do notice in the corner...

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** Only when the lights move onto that space, something glistens.

**[00:39:51 - 00:40:00]** And each time it moves, each time it glistens, it seems like it's moving, like there's some sort of creature somewhere over here.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:30]** probably 15 feet away from you hiding in the dark trying to move and now that the door is open the light the purple light from the hallway casts into there a little bit is it one large room or is it two small rooms it's two small rooms from my view but there's something moving in here I think it's attracted to light so Rick will march down along the wall and say let me take lead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:49]** and kind of push them back i'm going to come back and see if i can turn off this light turn off the light that is in the hallway that like rotating it looks like it's like one of those the one that's attracting it or something


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** Oh, there's a couple of them in there.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** A couple of what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** A couple of lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:58]** Yeah, kind of like the spotlights that rotate in places where they're looking for people.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** Here's his blind sense, and he rolled a pretty high perception.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:07]** He wants to see if he can sense any creatures that he can't see, but he can sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:11]** Yeah, you are sure that there's a creature waiting.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Okay.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:13]** Singular?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Yeah.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** About 10, 15 feet away.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** And the weird thing with the blind sense...

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:33]** is that you can almost feel like a heartbeat or just some like collection of like heartbeat, but it's like, like it's very fast.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:39]** And it just, it irks that part of you that's standing in front of the door.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** You're like, ah, this feels weird.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** It like just adds to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** Is this a dark room or is it just hard to see this one creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:54]** it's just hard to see this one creature cause it's, it's, it's trying to hide, but you're, but you're confident that there's a creature there.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:58]** The room is dark enough that like, you can't just be like, Hey, what are you doing over?

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:03]** Like you can't see it exactly, but you can tell that something's glistening.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:08]** Looks like it's reflecting off of some sort of like carapace or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Oh, carapace.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Oh man.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** Um, Rick is kind of just going to glance back at the others.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Like, shall we proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** Nico's going to be like, why not?

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Of course you say that.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** Why not?

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Rick's got lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** Question, Dr. K, do you try and turn off the light?

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Nico just shrugs.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** Yes.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Okay, before Rick goes in?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Yes.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Okay.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** I noticed it...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** Perhaps the light attracts it and draws it some way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Okay.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:51]** So it takes maybe 30 seconds, but you're able to just, you just like hit it with your injection spear and that light goes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** He doesn't just pull the fuses or something.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** I feel like he's a little more intelligent to just beating it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** There's another one.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Should probably get rid of that one too.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Can.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** What about those spotlights?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Is there a way we could take those out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** The ones that are in the room?

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Spinning around, yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** That's fine.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:14]** You guys know, though, that once you do, you will be in, like, that is all the light that there is in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Do you say anything?

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** So I'm not worried about that.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** Are you guys talking about this at all out loud or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:25]** I informed everyone that I was turning off the light.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** You were there a moment ago.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Were you not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Don't turn off the light.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** I thought we were joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Do not turn off the light.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** I will not be able to see.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** I'll turn it back on.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Just let us hunt this thing real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** All right, then I'm staying out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Okay, I'll put it back on.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:46]** So I guess I put it back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** It's a waste of time.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Fine, fine.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** We'll abide by the humans' rules.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** You put it back on.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Okay.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** I don't know how to enter this room without just messing things up.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** So the creature that's in there is hiding...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Yeah, trying to hide.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:14]** And like I said, I'm just going to say that with your blind sense ears, you can feel the vibration of whatever its heart, whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** I think it's around here.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Yeah, can I tell kind of where it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:24]** Yeah, it's in... Yeah, it's in that area right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** Wait, his heart's beating fast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** The heart's beating very fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** But is that normal for this species?

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** Or is it, like... We don't know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** Here's what's gonna, like, telepathically tell the group.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:42]** Guys, it's in the west.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** Like, the west side of the room.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** I can hear its heartbeat.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** It's scared or excited.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** It's trying to hide.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** I don't know if you saw it.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** The east side, that's right.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** Here's a sense of direction that's kind of bad today.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** West, east.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** East.

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:02]** And I thought I saw a carapace, maybe like an exoskeleton.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** I think you saw that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** I'm sorry, I thought you were going to say, I thought I saw a putty cat.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** You thought you saw a putty cat, but you cheat.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** There's a cat that goes by your feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Sorry, these lights are killing me.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** So these lights that are spinning around, and they're like spotlights on the lighthouse.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:27]** Rick is in the doorway, so if the light hits him, does he feel anything as it passes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:33]** But that same feeling that he hears in Dr. Okay have...

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** You feel it now too.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** You feel it.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** Because you're standing right in front of the door.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** You feel this like... Something is like... It's like you're trying to suppress this feeling.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** You're like, I'm just trying to ignore it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:51]** And I can't fight this feeling anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Well done, Will.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Rick is going to call out.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Is anybody in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Well, now it knows.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** Okay, so... We can sense you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** Because he heard you say that this thing feels scared.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** And we all feel the fear.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:11]** So maybe it's contained in some kind of fear field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** We can empathize with it.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Fascinating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Observation from Android.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** What does it say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** You do hear this like...

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:30]** That like starts to go in motion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Hear that noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** Should we draw it out or should we just enter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** No.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** Should we call it out?

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** We should draw it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** Come out here and we will try to help you.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** We can assist you.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Friend.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** You took from me.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** You took from me.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** I take from you.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** You took from me.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** I take from you.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** You took from me.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** I take from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** And this loud noise as you all need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Did you guys all step back?

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** I stepped back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** I stepped back.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Yeah.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Okay.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** All right.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Here we go.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Here we go again.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Let's do this.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:20]** Why does everything want to fight us?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** We're just trying to be friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** Yeah, just trying to be friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** I'm going to point out, we were not murder hobo-ing this map.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** We're just having to fight everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Nico, you're not even involved yet.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** You're probably going to shoot it as soon as it comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Yeah, I am, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** Depends what it is, but depending what it is, we should try to talk it down, maybe.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Who got above 20?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** Not I. Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Who got above 15?

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** I did.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** What'd you get?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** 16.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Nice.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Already had that in here.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Randomly generated.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Awesome.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Who got above a 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Oh.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Dr. K, 15.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** And you got what, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** 20.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Oh, I said who got a 20.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** I'm sorry.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** My printer was going crazy, so I went to unplug it.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** What are you printing during combat?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Nothing.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** My printer was just like, dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** And I was like, oh, God, so I unplugged it.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Who is your printer from?

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Yeah, the 1970s.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** No.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** It's like half the Morse code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** I'd say it's almost 10 years old.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** Yeah, it's probably like, don't go in the room.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** It's going to kill you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** It prints it out on a piece of paper.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:33]** It's actually a really big fan of Rick because, you know, it listens to the show.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Machines like machines and stuff.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** It's hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Piers, what'd you get?

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Piers got a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Piers got a, ooh, rough.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Rick, what is your dexterity bonus?

**[00:48:44 - 00:49:12]** my dex bonus is a four oh nice okay awesome good good good stuff so you have heard this sound this like of this like screaming coming from the back of the room in this dark room with these lights spinning and it is going to be rick 19's turn first rick what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** Can I see it from where I'm standing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Not from where you're standing now.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** You moved back to the other side of the boulder.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** It's obscuring a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** The boulder is obscuring or the door is obscuring?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Both.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:27]** So I'm behind the boulder and then there's the doorway.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:31]** So if I step into the doorway, will I have a clean shot on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** You might be able to see it.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, you have dark vision, which is good, but you would need to roll a perception check to see if you can see it.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I don't know why that took me so long to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Everyone needs to step back.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** I will keep guard, and he's going to pull out his axe.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:54]** So he'll use his move axe to pull out his axe, and then he's going to delay an attack.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** So where do you step, Sarih?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** I don't step anywhere.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** I, I, I stepped out before we, um, like combat was initiated.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:07]** I, I said, I said, I'm stepping back and nobody else moved, but now I'm telling them like, you should all step back.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Okay.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:13]** Um, and so then I pull out my green X and I'm going to ready and attack.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** If this thing enters into my area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Okay.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:26]** If it enters into your area, as soon as you pull out the X right after that happens, um,

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:34]** You do, I would say, doctor okay, and here's, you hear this.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:43]** And this grenade rolls into the space right in front of the door.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** And I'm going to say that, Nico and Rick.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Nico, because you're far away.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** And Rick, because you're right behind the boulder.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** I'm just going to say that you are not going to be in the blast radius.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Thank you.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Step back.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** I told you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** So it is a 15-foot radius, but with the rock, I'm going to say you're okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** And it's going to be, I think it's a reflex save, right?

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** So give me a reflex save.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:21]** And actually, I think, Nico, because it's a 15-foot radius, I think you would be in the blast radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** John's trying to find ways to get me back.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:30]** Rick, I'm going to say because you're behind that rock, the rock takes most of the thing there.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:34]** But because it's forcing it out to the sides, you all need to make that save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Well, F you, John.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** I got a 25 for my reflex save.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Yeah, very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:40 - 00:52:04]** i get a 16 14 16 16 14 okay you all pass which i think is that half damage pretty sure that's half right i don't even know where you're at are you are you reading grenade and stuff it should say on the grenade right yeah but i just didn't look because i was trying to keep things going but let me just look expecting us to get for using paper books yeah this is a time where i'm happy to have the rules lawyer like looking for rules

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** Reflex save for half damage.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** That is max damage.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:17]** So you all take three points of damage as this frag grenade hits you.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Rough, rough, rough stuff.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** You there!

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Stop it.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** You just continue to hear that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** You do for me, I take review.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** You do for me, I take review.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** You do for me, I take review.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** I took nothing, sir.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** What do you do?

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Nico's going to do an intimidation check.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** Okay.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** And this is what he's going to say.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Let me roll the intimidation check first.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** Do you... Okay.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** 18 on the dice plus nine.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Roll a sense motive.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** That's a 27.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Roll a sense motive.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** A sense motive.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Yep.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Okay.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** Natural 20 plus seven.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** Natural 20 plus 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** I'm rolling good this round.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** That is awesome.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Yeah, that's really good.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:14]** This creature is under extreme duress.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Inconsolable.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** And you can intimidate, but... It's not going to do anything.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I didn't say that.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** You rolled really well.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Say what you're going to say.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:31]** I'm just letting you... Like, I'm giving you the sense motive so you know this thing is going through something and you are not sure what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** All right.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:39]** Nico's just going to... He's going to say, you're going to stop this right now or I swear you are so dead.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** It's under duress and you're going to intimidate it further?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** Okay.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** I rolled an intimidation check.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Yeah.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** It wasn't diplomacy.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** It was intimidation.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** That's good.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Okay.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** I rolled intimidate first, then a sense motive.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** I can't go back and take it back.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Okay.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:04]** Nico's going to ready an attack if he sees anything.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:10]** Yeah, Niko actually, he's gonna take one step back behind Hears.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Using his jump chance.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:17]** And it gives Hears a little bit of space to operate if he wants to move back.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** That's fair.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:25]** If Hears wants to jump back, Niko's gonna, he's gonna hold a firing action.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:29]** If Hears moves out of the way and there's an enemy in that space, he's gonna shoot.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** Let's hope that enemy is not Dr. Okay.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Thanks, buddy.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Dr. OK, it's your turn.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** So I can't see him, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:46]** Yeah, your first perception was to just see, like, there is something there.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:52]** If you want to roll another perception check to see if you know exactly where it is, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:57]** Based on, you know, all the talking that I've heard.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** I'm just trying to, like, you know, peer around the corner and see.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:05]** I'll give you a bonus because you already know so much.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Pretty good.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:11]** 18 on the die plus 12 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** So that's... Oh, that's impressive.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** That's awesome.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** Okay, so...

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** I will say this.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:34]** You do look in and you see something that is right beyond the first broken or the first tube that is directly in front of the door.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** You can kind of look.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:44]** You look through the tube and each time some of the light maybe reflects through and you see this creature that looks like

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:54]** It stands up kind of like a centaur, but it has this beetle centipede body with these antennae coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** I think he looks kind of cute, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** And these pincer teeth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Is he armored and has a spear like the picture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Please, yes.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:08]** You can see some sort of large pike thing that it has in one hand.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** It looks like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Do you want to describe it for the listeners?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Looks like what?

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:19]** It just looks like something from some ancient Greek phalanx member or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** He's got this layered armor.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** He's a Spartan bug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Hears can be friends with them, for sure.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** They're probably cousins or something.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** Yeah, because totally, all bugs, you know, we get along.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Right.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:34]** It's just like all robots and, you know, just like you were friends with the UFO bots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Yep, that's it.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** As long as my homie.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Dr. Okay, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** That's what you see.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:46]** Clearly, here's maybe a friend of yours to have a different life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** I was joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** Could I do like a life science check?

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** I could try a telepathic talk to him.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Having seen this creature now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** That won't freak him out more.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:04]** He's literally on his last bit of sanity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** 22.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:08]** 22, I would say.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:13]** Yeah, I think that's enough to know what this creature is and to get something cool from it.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** That's what I'm going to rule.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Nice.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:20]** This is what's called a bolida.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:24]** They are arthropod in creatures.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:30]** They dwell not on the faces of the planets, but deep underground.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:35]** So deep that they're blasted by like the heat of the molten core.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:43]** They're centipede creatures with these chitinous plates that cover their backs from head to the tip of their tail.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** This armor protects them from like subterranean hazards.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** And they have, you know, I think,

**[00:57:48 - 00:58:15]** what what it's like four set of feet that it moves on on either side um and they typically are miners that's like the the industry that they're involved in because they can go so deep below the core that they can get uh rare elements that you can't get anywhere else the cool thing that you know about this well what is what is one thing that you would want to know uh

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** special abilities or like... Special abilities, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:22]** Damage resistance or... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:33]** From looking at the creature's physiology from the way that it moves, you can guess that this thing can roll up into a tight ball and this ball would be...

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:50]** almost impenetrable i mean like yes you can hit it but it would get a lot of bonuses if it were to just like move into this tight ball and it could probably move around as the ball it could like roll places sorry i don't mean to interrupt but did i tell you about the centipede that i found outside my front door was it a bolita


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** It was similar.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** It was like day three of living in our new apartment in Maryland.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Nice.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** Which is full of all sorts of weird bugs.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** But this thing was like crawling straight towards our door.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:04]** And I was like, I took my dog out to walk and I closed the door behind me.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** I was like, no.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I came back and it was like crawling up the wall or up the door.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** That's unbelievable.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Unbelievable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** That's a pun.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** That's a punishment.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** Punishment.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Will gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** No, he doesn't.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** We wiped him clean.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** He's got the first punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** That was unbelievable.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** That was great.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** That was very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** I vote aye.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** Aye.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** I don't even think you have to vote on that one.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** All right, so that's what you know, Dr. Okay.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:47]** What do you want to do now that you feel this suddenly advantage from punishment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:55]** Guys, this thing's, believe it or not, this thing...

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:59]** This is going to be possibly tough if it rolls up in a ball.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** I think we got to take this guy down quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** It doesn't appear as if we would need to hurt it.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** I think it is just as scared as we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Okay.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Well, it just threw a grenade, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** I went Dr. Okay on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:29]** I'm for putting him down slowly or quickly, but I'll do non-lethal if that's the case, if he wants to stop throwing grenades.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** So what do you want to do?

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:36]** Also, he'll be unpenetrable if he rolls up in that ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Oh, man.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Super defensive.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Yes.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** It's not very scary at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:42 - 01:01:03]** um whose turn is it now it's still it's still dr okays you did you did a perception check and a life science check yeah can i shoot from here you can it's gonna have probably partial cover okay i'll just go for it and i'll go with the uh my cast jet run okay here we go here we go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** Oh, 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:16]** 15 just barely makes it as it goes through a part of the tube that had cracked and you hear it hit.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:20]** And that same sound of, you took from me, you took from me.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:26]** It doesn't interrupt that phrase too much, but you can definitely tell that you hit with your costa jet.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** Nice.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** What are you going to do?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Slash how much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:34]** Well, I didn't call out the biohack, so I'm not going to retcon it.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:56]** yeah so i'll just do the regular effect which is not bad okay so not max but five points of acid damage dang five points of acid damage to this creature impressive impressive impressive

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** All right.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:58]** It is.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Here's your turn.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** Here's his first going to blind sense again to determine if it's moved.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Okay.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** And roughly how far away it is from him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:10]** It hasn't moved.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** It's also not his turn, but it hasn't moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** Okay.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:16]** Roughly how far away is it?

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** 15 feet.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** 15 feet.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Okay.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:24]** Here's is going to go back to here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Okay.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** I'm going to try to do this.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:41]** Here's this thinking of casting Unseen Servant to send in his Unseen Servant and collect off of this creature any more grenades that it might have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** That's super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** It's just within range for that.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Okay.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:55]** Yeah, it's the spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that can perform simple tasks and it can perform them repeatedly.

**[01:02:55 - 01:03:01]** Anyway, so anyway, he does that.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:12]** So, like, out of, like, here's, like, stretches forth his hand, and then, like, an invisible sort of, like, wispy creature, like, briefly comes out, but then, like, turns completely invisible and goes into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:20]** My worry is that if you're trying to take something from the creature, that's going to be an attack roll for disarm, and Unseen Servants can't make attack rolls.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:27]** But that's super freaking cool, so I don't want to tell you not to.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Oh, okay.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:32]** I want you to be able to do it because it's super cool.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** It's just like a sneaky.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** It's kind of like steel or pickpocket.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Sorry, go ahead.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:39]** Yeah, you would just need to... It would have to be stealthy, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Yeah.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Well, it is invisible, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Oh, that's right.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** It is invisible.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:45]** Okay.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** So if it doesn't know that it's there...

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:51]** I think that's cool enough that I'll just give you one chance, right?

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:56]** Because I think technically it would be an attack roll to disarm because it's a combat maneuver.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:01]** But since you're trying to yank it, pickpocket, which I feel like would fall more under the skill.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** What's that skill?

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** Sleight of hand.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** Sleight of hand.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:09]** Yeah, I feel like you would get one sleight of hand chance to take any other grenades from it, which is super dope.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Okay, I'll try.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** I love it.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:15]** All right, so that is one standard action to cast it, right?

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** And then does it act on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** Yes, I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** Hold on.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:32]** It cannot perform a task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:35]** Ooh, a side of hand trained skill?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Yes, I believe so.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:39]** Ooh, then that would be... What?

**[01:04:39 - 01:05:08]** you would just know that i think how this would work out would be that like if you want to like retcon it and you didn't cast it you would just know that this unseen servant is not that dexterous to like go do that if that's what it is but i'm just looking up sleight of hand it says you can hide small objects pick pockets and accomplish other oh no that's sleight of hand that i'm doing never mind yeah i see what you're saying i was like literally reading that yeah all right so what's the issue can you explain it to me again rules lawyer just one more time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:16]** So it can't do things... Well, first it can't attack, so if there's any way of considering theft an attack roll.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:21]** But then it also says you can't do any skill that requires a DC check of 10 or higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** Ah, it does say that, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** Or if it's something that's trained.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** Or something that's trained.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Sleight of hand is a trained skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** That's the bigger thing.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** Because what the DC would be would be whatever.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:37]** But the fact, like, you can't do any Transkill.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** I'm sorry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** That's all right.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Super cool.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** It's sad, but whatever.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Okay.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Right.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Okay.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:46]** Well, okay.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:48]** Real quick, like, here's moved then, basically.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:55]** So what he's going to do is he's going to also check to see if there's any weaknesses, which is, I guess, a life science check or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:00]** Yeah, because I'm guessing Dr. Okay said all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:03]** Oh, yes, and I'll gladly assist you.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** I can barely make it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:12]** Because he looked up, because Dr. Okay, like, checked, like, what things he can do, but he didn't check weaknesses, right?

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Yes.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** Because he only had, like, one thing he could do.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Okay, cool.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** If you could assist, please, that'd be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** Yes, I can certainly do that.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:20]** 29.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** I love it.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:27]** The weakness is that it has what's called light blindness.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:33]** So if it's exposed to direct bright light, then it will be blinded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Great.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** Then here's this one round and then dazzled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** Good find.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Here's tells us to the group.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:44]** He's like, this thing is really sensitive to light.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** It's an underground creature.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** So if you can blind it, you're in good shape.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** And to that end,

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:58]** He rolls, uh, he casts dancing lights, which are these two lights that he can, uh, um, and the range is really high, so that's no problem.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:02]** And he just like throws both of them in the area where he senses it to be.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** Okay.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:07]** So these two lights come out of here's and then they go inside the room right to his spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:08]** Okay.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** That is awesome.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** They're pretty bright, too.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:13]** They're like the headlights and flashlights.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** I just tried to add them on roll 20 here.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** But yeah, so there are two super bright lights.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** Yeah, there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** Actually, it's up to four lights.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** So he does four lights.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** I should say, though, that it's a spell DC of 15.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Oh, it says there's no saving throw.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** So I guess he just has to roll.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:49]** what's the so so what's the dc for dc 15 i'm not sure it just says dc 15 saving throw none spell resistance no so why is there a dc 15 i don't know it's weird where did you see i don't see dc 15 on it for dancing lights it's like direction up to one minute up to four uh lights i don't see a dc of anything

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:56]** On Hero Lab, it says caster information spell DC 15, but there's no saving throw mentioned, so I think it's just lights.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:58]** I don't see why there would be a saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** It might be a concentration thing.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:02]** Like, it is a concentration spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:04]** It doesn't say anything about that, though, otherwise.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:09]** It just says that they're good for, like, at least a minute or around a minute or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:10]** Okay.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Yeah, duration of a minute.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:12]** Duration one minute.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** That's super cool.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** I like it.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** Okay.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:23]** Yeah, so as that happens, you do hear like... As this light blinds it.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:30]** And you can see very clearly now the shape, Dr. Okay, of the creature behind the tube hiding.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]** Keir's awesome turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:52]** top thanks of the second round rick what are you doing uh well i didn't get my attack but um he's gonna kind of just glance at everyone and then step forward into the room oh yeah you're gonna step forward and then glance into where is this thing i can't see it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:53]** I know.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** Hold on.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:54]** Hold on.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:54]** Show me.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** Just like dragging your ass into the room across the floor.

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:03]** No, it's honestly the fact that Roll20 is being, because it's all, it's very slow right now for me.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:11]** It is directly behind the, with the square that is right in front of you where that tube is.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:14]** It's right behind it in that small piece of square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:16]** Rick kind of opens his palms.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:26]** He's got the axe in one hand, but he kind of has it lowered, and he's got his left palm open, and he looks his creature as close as he can in the eyes, and he says, We are not here to harm you.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:27]** What is your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:43]** It's right as you step in, you do put one hand down, palm open, axe in the other hand, and you are able to get those words out, but

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:51]** But as you do, you get this feeling, that same feeling of unease.

**[01:09:52 - 01:10:00]** As soon as you step in, it, like, takes a second, and then you feel it building, and your body seems to, like, resonate with the room.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:06]** And you need to make a we'll save next time.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:10]** Because that's our episode.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** We'll save next time!

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:11]** So it's sad.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** What?

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:13]** Ugh.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]** Ugh.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:14]** Ugh.
