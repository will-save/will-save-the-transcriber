## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:09]** Our crew of cohorts are forced to contend once again with the fearsome and feral Greybounder.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:28]** Nico leads the team to a cautiously optimistic assault on the feral beast as the group squares off with some help from Hears' unseen servant by synchronizing strikes from cover through the carefully timed opening and closing of the door between the Bounder and our crew.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:39]** only to discover that where this bounder is going, it doesn't need doors, as it passes through their improvised defenses and into close quarters with our cadre.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:44]** Can the crew finally quell this creature, or are they the ones about to be crushed?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** Nico, you're supposed to say something here.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** It's phasing through the door!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** Nick, I pointed at you for like 10 seconds before you said anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I'm sorry.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** I was not looking at you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:01]** This is better than any intro we could have thought of.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** Talking about how we're like, oh, we should talk about that.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** And then I'm like, all right, Nick, I'll point at you.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** So then we do our clap, our sync, three, two, one, clap.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** And then I point at Nick and he's not looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:17]** Nick looks away and he doesn't look back at the computer for like 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:43]** that's too good oops yeah long story short is uh nico's about to die you might die nico let's hope i don't i'm hoping on the luck of the uh luck of the orions look that's what they say in the back world family has such a legacy huh on uh saint orion's day saint orion's day that's what they say he's uh he's uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** He's an intergalactical treasure, him and his family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** It seems like the family paid for a holiday.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** That's my guess.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Nico emigrated from Ireland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Nico emigrated from Ireland.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:57]** We were just potato farmers from Space Island.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** During the potato famine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** I'm remembering the days of Jonathan Swift.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** If you do die, though, how does the party feel about just having Nico taxidermied?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** I don't want to carry around a taxidermy deco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** Just prop him up in front of a computer and he gets scared for the rest of his life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** It would be a good decoy tactic.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** Sorry.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Just throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** You guys are just stupid.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:28]** Hey, guys, I got a game we're going to play.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** We're going to play Get Help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** It'll be just like our games we used to play for D&D.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:40]** We're like, well, ghost hand, move your arms like Bernie's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:40 - 00:04:06]** put some sunglasses on you well but we already kind of have it with with the with the with the surfer bro chad who is here's his unseen servant it might be good to have nico as someone's other unseen servant you know so he just like comes in every now and again yeah yeah exactly as a ghost but he'd always just be encouraging them to murder he'd be like liability liability liability liability

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** You're a murder bot, Rick.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** He's like the demon in your ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:19]** The unseen servant comes in at any moment where you're getting ready to take hostages and just say, Liability!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** We had, you know, to...

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:31]** To piggyback off the taxidermy idea, Ariel and I had briefly mentioned for our cat, Terrence, who passed away earlier this year.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Oh, I miss him every day.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Yeah, good GG, Terrence.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Good dude.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Best dude.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** We talked briefly about taxidermy him, and then we were like...

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Nah, we're not going to.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** That's, no.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:50]** And then we also talked about maybe like getting his ashes and then like getting tattoos with his ashes under his skin.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** And then we were like, eh, we're not going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** Yeah, I've always told my wife that like when Bodhi passes away, I'm going to have him taxidermied.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** And like his, you know, pose that he always is like he's just laying in the corner.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** Yeah.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:09]** And we're just going to put him in the corner and I can go pet him whenever I want.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Yeah.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** But then she points out that that's really weird and creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** See, that's kind of how we were like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:42]** when you say it out loud you're like no i told you guys about my cat or my rabbit right no how do you feel about mounted uh game yeah it's weird i just went to the uh i don't think it's weird like the nature center here and they have all these like taxidermied animals posed as if they're like like these wolves eating uh these taxidermied wolves eating a taxidermied deer and like it's the scene and like oh man those are like real animals like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:49]** It was last month, I think it was, the scientists declared a bunch of species extinct.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Yeah, it was pretty sad.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** Taxidermy, you can see some pretty old animals.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Historical.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Good to study.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** But my rabbit, so I had a rabbit and I left for the Navy and my parents were taking care of it.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:11]** I really wanted to, I told my parents I wanted to keep the rabbit to make a rabbit's foot out of it.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** And my parents didn't listen to me at all.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** That's so rude.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** And they didn't even do anything with the bunny.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** They just threw it away, I found out later on.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** What?

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Yeah, just put my rabbit in the trash.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** And I was like, that is rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** You guys didn't even like... Oh, actually, that's how I disposed of rabbit once.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Like, it's hard to know what to do with a rabbit.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Was it your rabbit?

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** It's kind of complicated.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** But, like, it was really complicated.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Wait a minute.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** What?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Well, it was sort of my rabbit.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** It was someone's rabbit that we were watching.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** But, in fairness, they abandoned the rabbit.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** They were horrible.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** It sounds to me like... Also, it's a rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** It's a stray rabbit.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** They're cute, though.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** They're super cute.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** They are.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** What I'm taking away from this, though, is that we're all animal people.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:01]** Just want to point that out, which is really good, because I don't want to be in the company of somebody who's not, so it's okay.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** And on that, would you mind cloning your dogs, then, because...

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Oh, yeah, cloning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** You mentioned this during a meeting, and I was like, what?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:13]** Okay, wait, how much does it cost to clone your pet?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Is it based on size, or is it based on genetic code?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** I don't know.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:25]** I think it's based on, I don't know maybe how weird the genetics are or whatever, but a cat, this is a reputable place, so you can probably get it cheaper for a shady place.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** Who's doing it?

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:31]** A reputable place for a cat is $25,000, and for a dog is $50,000.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:38]** Which, if you're a crazy celebrity, isn't that bad, which is why Barbra Streisand has cloned her corgis, I think they are, like seven times or something.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** Like, she's cloned a lot of her the same dog over and over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Does she just name them, like, one, two, and three?

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Are they, like, exactly the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:51]** Dawn, Day, and Dusk.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Who knows, man?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Like, I don't know what Barbra Streisand gets up to.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** So then, like, it's just Barbra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Hey, Barbra.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** We just call her up.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** I'm very interested.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** I don't know what she sounds like outside of her corgis.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** Hello.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** He sounds like Robin Williams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:14]** If you're a listener and you know Barbra Streisand and want to reach out, we want to meet her corgis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** If she listens to the show like The Rock does, then that's how we'll know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** While she's working out every Wednesday?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** While she's working out with her corgis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:27]** I think I was playing a record last week.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** It may not be corgis.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I can't remember what the hell they are.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** There's some small dog with small feet.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** That's all I remember.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:36]** As opposed to small dogs with abnormally large feet.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:47]** Anyway, she was of the opinion that dogs don't get entirely cloned and that there is a soul because her dogs are radically different, she says, every time she clones them.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** What if it's like Harry Potter Horcruxes?

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Every time you clone it, you split the soul just a little more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:59]** Oh my god, and it's just torture inside.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:03]** After a while, the clones just start running into walls, wanting to die.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** They just stare into dark corners, just waiting.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Have you seen Monster City?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** With Michael Keaton?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Michael Keaton.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** The first one is he clones himself, because that's a big thing, cloning is new, so he clones himself.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** And then it gradually gets into, he clones a clone, and then clones a clone.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:50]** and so every clone that's and it gets a little dumber but they each have different personalities so like it turns out to be like each each shade of his personality so one clone is the good clone one clone is like the evil clone another clone is like the ocd clone and then there's one clone who's just like a complete moron and that's a lot of my favorite lines like in all film history come from like i like pizza and he puts a pizza into his wallet this is great i want to see this it's a family guy episode remember with like uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:50 - 00:10:15]** uh stewie brian do you remember that no yeah anyway i don't know if we can say that i should say that but it's a funny episode of family tell the joke yourself right now and then we'll all laugh it's not really a joke it's it's just like it's a whole scene like like yeah stewie and brian clone or a stewie clones himself and it's just called stewie and like he can just perform like you know sort of simple tasks oh that's right it's the same for brian and yeah right but

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** Anyway, you can make a Ghost in the Shell where you put your memory in the cloud, but you have other bodies you can go into.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** That's better than cloning.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** That's kind of like Altered Carbon.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Altered Carbon, too.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:31]** Altered Carbon's great, but Ghost in the Shell did it way earlier, just saying, unless Altered Carbon's a book that I don't know about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** That was a Netflix series.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Altered Carbon was just the, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Anyway, Ghost in the Shell's a good anime.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** Check it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** Oh, yeah, it's classic.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** That's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** But don't watch the movie with Scarlett Johansson.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Don't.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** It's pretty bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Was it Scarlett Johansson?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** I feel like it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** It was, yeah.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Scarlett Johansson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Johansson.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** All right, Nick.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:51]** Well, if the party wants to clone you after your death, that's up to them.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Otherwise, make sure you have a backup character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** I think we're all being a little presumptuous.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** I think we're all being a little presumptuous.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I might live.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Knock on wood, I might live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Let's just review.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** You have how much health and how much stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** He has enough for two attacks, I think, if he's lucky.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** So he could make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** And this bounder gets two attacks.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Oh, I forgot about that.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** It gets two attacks only when it charges.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** And it was charging you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** True.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Because it can make a full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** Can it charge through walls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:29]** No, charge is the same and the pounce is the same.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** So it's the same as the charge that you do.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** So you have to move at least 10 feet in a straight line.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Diagonals count.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** So, that's where we're at.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Should we play?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Here we go.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Good luck.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Yeah, let's play.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Let's play.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:50]** Leroy Jenkins!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Playing that for Nick.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:52]** That was Leroy Jenkins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:59]** Well, I'm also within range of this thing, and my health is not the greatest, so Rick is also concerned about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** That's true.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** Don't tell John how little or how much health you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Oh, I'm full health.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Rude.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:07]** Rude.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** That's very rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** You should, yeah.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Indeed.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** So let me just quickly say this.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:22]** You guys decided that you're going to just ante up, come back into this room, and fight this Greybounder.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:33]** You came up with a pretty sweet plan to hack the door, which you nailed, Nico.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Sorry about that.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** You just nailed it.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** Then you said, all right, we're going to throw a grenade, but you're going to supercharge the grenade, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Yep.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Wait, wait, can I stop you for just a second?

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** We didn't choose to do this.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** We didn't ante up and go back just to fight them to prove we're tough.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** It's the only way.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:59]** This is the path we have to take in order to get out of this...

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:25]** debacle that we're in period like there's no going back there's nowhere else to go this is the only path and it's through this boundary yeah i mean indeed we didn't i'm just pointing that out i'm just pointing that out i'm just saying like i made it sound like we're trying to show we're tough guys no we forgot that he could face through the wall john did warn us but we were like maybe i think uh i have a plan but okay okay because we're like it's a good plan okay

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** Okay, we supercharged the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** You supercharged the grenade.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** It's like cooking in your handroid.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** In your handroid hand.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** In your handroid hand.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** It's cooking in your handroid.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** The door opens a crack.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** You feel the psychic, like...

**[00:13:43 - 00:14:03]** you know growl from this creature throw it it goes off shuts the door there's if you meet the minimum for damage threshold of some you know something bad happening and then you all begin your attack door opens up pretty sure nico attacked

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:25]** shot and then we ended with the bounder coming to phase through the door next to nico so i'm gonna move you guys over on roll 20 wait did everybody see the roll 20 landing page nick's not no nick's not not yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** Oh, it's so good.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** It's the door, or it's like the hallway, and then the bounder pops up.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** John, you're such a jerk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:41]** Yeah, the landing page is just a bulkhead door that opens up, and then it cradles into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:48]** For the listeners, John updates the landing page just a little bit every week, and it's animated.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:58]** So, yeah, it's the landing page we showed, I think, on Twitter or something before, but now it has a door pop up, and then it shows the Bounder appear over it.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** Over some skeleton of like a dead gazelle or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** You're a special human being, John.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** You're a special human being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** It's like a gray anamorph is what it is.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** Or a xenomorph from Aliens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** All right.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** So you guys are on the map now.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** We're going to go back.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** Now the gray bounder took its move action to...

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:53]** phase through the door and you know what i thought about this i thought this is the most appropriate it is going to attack nico of course okay of course but of course why is it the most appropriate what is your reasoning uh because i just took a slash at it dude put his sword through the door and try to stab him also also i just thought it was such a cool image as the creature you can see this creature has a super long scorpion tail you

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:06]** The creature moves into the space next to you in this tiny 10x10, and then the tail phases through the door in front of you, and the tail comes to stab you and impale you in the chest.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:12]** So the creature is next to you, but the tail's going to come through the other side of the door.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:18]** It's like you watch the tail slowly move across the door until it thwaps at you.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** And I'm going to roll this dice again at Gen Con.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** Which is the glassy purple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** Wait, do you have to roll a phase chance on that?

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** Because he has to phase through the door to do that.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** So there's a chance he can't phase through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Yeah.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** No, that's not how that works.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** It can move through doors.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Oh, damn it.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Wait, it can phase on its own whenever it wants?

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** I thought there was some mischance with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** That's when you guys are shooting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** If we're attacking.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** 20%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:49]** Nico's going to say, as this thing's trying to attack him, he's going to say, guys...

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** There's a tail coming through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:55]** I suggested that you should not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:59]** Guys, as this tail comes at your face.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** Oh, man, I knew I could count on this die.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Roll the natural 18.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** It's going to be a 30 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** That sneaker is dead.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** That hits.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:33]** That is going to be nine points of piercing damage as this tail, just the sharp blade of it, I imagine, misses your heart but cuts through maybe your shoulder and where your chest meet, it starts to just stab right in there, missing your artery, and then come back out.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** You also need to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** Will save!

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** I also like to drop where it's just Kelly going, we'll save.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** We'll save.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** Super aggressive.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Oh!

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** Natural 20 plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Let's go.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** Somehow we'll save.

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:14]** John, somehow, as it pierces you, right, the sense of psychic fear overwhelms you, and you just feel this resolve, I think, just come over you, this cold, icy resolve, and it shakes off you like mist coming off in the morning.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:19]** You are not subject to its psychic terror.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:22]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:25]** You pull out an avocado, bite right into it.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Skin.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** Skin is still on it.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** All right.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** I'm going to go back to the Don Don.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Always going to rep that.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** That was its move.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** And then it's attacked.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** Does it do anything else?

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** I don't think so.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** It's got three more attacks.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I believed in you.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** I knew.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** I roll a d20, and that's how many more attacks it gets.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** All right.

**[00:18:47 - 00:19:00]** It doesn't do anything except as the tail hits, there is a sense of psychic satisfaction that you feel, Nico, this feeling of as a hit lands on its prey.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** And that is its turn.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** Rick19, let's get going.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** You're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:29]** let's see what you guys can do so rick has his laser artillery um okay he had it like pointed at the door and as this thing came through he kind of like flinches just a bit and then then he just he gets this realization and he drops his artillery laser to the ground he just like says out loud like looks like there's no retreating now and he pulls out his battle axe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** All right.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** It's a murder butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Let's do this.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Too bad your gun lands on Hears' toe.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Hears takes 20 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** With a broken pinky toe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Hold on a second.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Why do I have a plus three?

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Oh, yeah, plus five.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** That's good.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** All right.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** So I have a plus five to hit.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:50]** Okay.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:54]** And I got a natural one.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** You got an extra one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:01]** I swear to God, if you hit me and you kill me, I'm going to be pissed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** Thank you, Norse Foundry, with your name in the sky.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** The one time that it doesn't land between two numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** So how long has it been since we've done a critical fumble?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Is that what we're doing here?

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Are we still on that train?

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** Oh, no, I'm just silent because I'm irritated.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** It was like a deck.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** But yes.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** Yeah.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** That's what I thought.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** All right.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** So it's a melee attack.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** We got the official Starfinder critical fumble deck.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** I'm going to take out these rules because no one likes rules.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** All right.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:37]** I'm going to, since we're recording remotely, I'm going to hold this in front of the screen, Kev.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** You tell me when to stop.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** Ready?

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Looking.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Three, two, one.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** This was a melee, right?

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Yes, it was.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Tunnel vision.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:58]** For three rounds, you gain a plus one bonus to attack rolls and a minus two penalty to AC and perception checks.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** It's not that bad.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** That's not... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Yeah, that's alright.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** I'm kind of surprised.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** I need to write this down somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** At least he didn't hit me.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Sorry, it's a plus two to AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** No.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** Minus two to AC, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Oh, I heard a plus something in there.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Yeah, there's a plus one to your attack.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Hold on, I just want to make sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** I just want to make sure I was reading it right.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Sounds like you read it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I get a plus seven to attack.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Yeah, you get a plus 50 to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** You always hit.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Oh.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** I see.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Okay.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** No, it's not what you read.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** Okay.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Energy, kinetic, or spell, right?

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:44]** So the first three, the top three, energy, kinetic, or spell, and then if the extreme matches the type, you take the extreme.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** That's what it is.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:50]** And unfortunately, this card is extreme melee, and you are using extreme melee.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** I'm so confused.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** So what are you telling me is going on?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:57]** Based on your damage type, it's either energy, kinetic, or spell, right?

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** And there's one for each, the top three, right?

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** And then there's an extreme at the bottom.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:08]** And if the extreme matches the energy type that you were using, then you go with the extreme.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** So it's the extreme.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** This is not bad, except...

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:18]** Choked too far up, your weapon flies 2D4 squares in a randomly determined direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** Rick, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Question, though.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** The door's mostly closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** You're right.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:32]** So I have a feeling that the door behind you is not closed, right?

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** Because Dr. K... That is true.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:40]** So what I'm going to say is roll either... 2d4, you said?

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** Yeah, so that's how many squares it's going to move away.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:47]** And then I would just say roll a... How many squares does it move away?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Eight?

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Seven.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Seven squares.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** All right, so it moves.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** You throw it.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:58]** You bring it up and just flies back over Dr. Groke's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** Wait, do I roll direction now?

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** Is that what you said?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Yeah, I'm fine to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:09]** It could either move one, two, three, four, five.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** I feel like it can move in any five squares around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** It could theoretically bounce into the wall and ricochet, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:20]** I'm going to say, though, I don't know about Ricochet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** So it could orient 360, I'm assuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** I'm just going to say that we could either do this.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:32]** Either you could say that you are swinging and it comes up and it goes 35 feet back into the room behind you.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:38]** I do think that if you want to roll the five around you, because maybe it just hits the wall and lands on the ground.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:51]** I will say that if you roll it in a square or in a direction where one of your party members is at, I'm going to say maybe a 10% chance that it hits them for, let's say, a D4 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** So you're going to roll a D6?

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I'm giving you a choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** You can either choose that it goes 35 feet all the way back,

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:03]** Or it could just land right there in the room and five feet away from you, and you can pick it up.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** But it might hit Nico.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** Or it might hit Dr. Echo.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Or me, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** I think you should lose it.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** Rick, before you do this... And we retreat and go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** No, because this is my only weapon.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:21]** My only weapon besides my artillery laser, which is a ranged weapon, which means I'll take attack of opportunity every time I shoot.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** So I don't want to lose this.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** I want to keep it within range.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** This is...

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:50]** uh i'm gonna roll a d6 on a one it's gonna go out the room 35 feet and then on any and then on any of the others it's gonna two let's say one or two two would be uh here's a three would be dr okay four would be the blink square next to me that's what i was thinking five would be nico six and six would be six would be the bounder six anyone uh the bounder


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:56]** But what about also hitting the square to your immediate right and just dropping right back into your hands?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** It would land on the ground, but it could just hit the square behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Well, yeah, we'll consider that the blank square as well.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** So, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:34]** well one is that's like a one is directly behind you one is like it just hits the wall falls lands in your square or it lands on the uh it hits the wall and lands in the uh um dude's square nah that'll listen wait so what one is like it goes out the hallway i thought like all the way out into the other room no no no let's just do this there are six ways that it can go around you just just roll a d6 one will be directly behind you two is here's it's a three

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:52]** it's a three so it's dr okay it's dr okay so roll a d100 if it's a 10 or lower or if it yeah so i roll a d100 and a d10 a d100 well just yeah just a d10 and a yeah and then the thing is that i'm gonna say it's 10 and we're gonna go below so if it's 90 or above then you hit dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I got an 11.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** I got 10 and a 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** A 10 and a 1.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** That's 11.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** So you're good.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** So it does fly.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:07]** I'm going to say it probably lands right into the square next to Dr. Okay.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** So it is currently about 10 feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** It's over here.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Sorry, I'm marking on the map so I can understand where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:20]** It does say 2D4 away, but I'm going to say that I'm pretty sure there's a wall there based on the other map.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** So I'm going to say it hits that wall and then, boom, lands on the ground.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** So it's 10 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** Oh, this is such s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** All right, that's your turn.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** I can still move.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** I'm going to take a guard.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** I thought that you took a move to pull out your weapon.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Or is that a switch action?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** You dropped your weapon.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** It was a free action.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** I thought you pulled out a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** Well, if I move, I get a free weapons pull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** But I think you already moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** I didn't move.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Unless you're saying that is my move.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** You're saying...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Yeah, that's what I'm checking.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Fine, fine.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** I feel like we should know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Well, no, if I move, I have a plus one.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Yes, but if I move, I also can draw for free.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** So... I see what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Yeah, I feel like you were just standing there, though.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Move on.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** All right, Dr. O'Kane, it's your turn.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** I'm pissed off.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** I'm angry.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** I know.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Dr. O'Kane, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** What are you doing?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:11]** Yeah, so I'm going to...

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** A giant melee weapon flies past your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** You're going to make an impact to me?

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** Rick, I think you dropped this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** Is it on my square?

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** No, it's on the square right behind you.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:35]** Can I reach into it and just give it to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Yeah, that's what they're going to reach.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** It is within your reach.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** I think that would be... Does it do any check?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** No, I'm just wondering if that would be an action.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:47]** It would probably be... I think it would be a move action to pick it up and then hand it to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** Yeah, would he gain any effects from that?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** I mean, could I give him... No, I can't give him my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:00]** I feel like that would then be Rick's move action next turn.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** Your next move action would be taking it.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Yeah.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Okay.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Yep.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Okay.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** What do you say?

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:11]** Rick, I think you should hold on to it this time.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Hit him where it hurts.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Here, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Take this.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Thank you, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** Calmly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** He's super angry.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** He's so disappointed in himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** We're saying this in combat, Rick.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:29]** This creature's like, this isn't a game.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** This isn't a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** We need to put this beast down.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** I tried, and then I ended up throwing my axe 30 feet.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Okay, well, don't do that.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:46]** Thank you, Norse Foundry.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** That's where Rick was created.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Norse Foundry.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** That's why he's so faulty.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** I mean...

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** Can I, on my turn, give him a boost?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Rick, yeah.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Yeah.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Okay.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:09]** Because I feel like I'm interacting with him, and he's in melee range with this thing who's obviously after Nick.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Well, that would be your standard action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:35]** yeah yeah uh so i'll give him a like a pharmacy pharmacological boost pharmacological this is this probably would do this i would do the uh nick you know a lot about medical stuff is pharma is a pharmaceutical is that is that a term


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** No, it's most certainly not, but that's okay.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:42]** For the purposes of Starfinder, we'll say that the term has evolved over centuries.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** I'd like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** That's good.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** It's pharmacy for animals.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** It's fine.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** I can picture Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:55]** grabbing it and then handing it to Rick, and as Rick reaches out, you, like, stab Rick in the arm with this booster.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:01]** I'm just reading up on... I mean, I think you should just take an attack on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** What do you do?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Hashtag metagame.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** So you're saying I could do that instead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** Well, yeah, your standard action would be to attack, and then your move action would be handing me my axe back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Okay.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** I could hit him then with my cost jet.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Acoustichet?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Yeah.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Okay.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Acoustichet it up.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** Roll some foundry deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Acoustichetting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Acoustichet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** We'll do the... A sonic wave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** Are you more than ten diameters away?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** This is turbulence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:38]** I'm going to try an experimental sort of concoction here on this beast.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** I think he needs to be subdued.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** And I'm going to use my Spark of Ingenuity.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Awesome.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:57]** Which allows me to combine the effects of two biohacks into one, expending use of just one of my biohacks.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** That's awesome.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** So, like, I only use one biohack, and I can combine two.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** We can make them better than they were before.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:08]** Yeah, so I'm going to...

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:20]** Reduce... You said from our knowledge checks we determined from before that the damage resistance wasn't what this creature had, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** Correct.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** It has a 20% mischance from its phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:28]** Can you reduce a target's resistance to one type of energy?

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** It doesn't have damage resistance, technically.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** It has this phase.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Does it have a resistance?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** No.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Okay.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Then just a minus two to AC.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Minus two to AC.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** And also you need to do a fortitude save.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** Okay.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** I'm not going to roll glassy P for that.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** I have to roll to hit though first.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Okay.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** And you got that 20% mischance.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** So roll to hit.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** Let's say 14 on the die plus four, 18.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** 18.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** 18.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:25]** definitely hits against casey right uh yeah yeah so then roll your 20 chance to see as if it was as it was phasing through did you shoot it and it goes through part of the phased thing so i feel like you would need to get either well let's say let's do 20 and lower so it so if you get under 20 you don't hit if you get above 20 you're good we'll just delta green it okay okay

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** 87.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** 87.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** You're good.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** You're good at this.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** I always picture her like a mini harpoon gun.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** Shoots this little pneumatic dart, lands in the fleshy gray skin.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** There doesn't even seem to be any veins or anything.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** It just goes right in like rubber.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:48]** Just kind of sticks there.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Gross.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** What kind of damage is that?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** That is injection damage.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Okay.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** How much damage?

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Plus two and nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Nine points of damage?

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Wow.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Yeah.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** All right.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Incredible.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:11]** And then I need to make a 42 save and minus two to... You have a minus two to your AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Okay.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** And you need to roll a fort save DC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Okay.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** DC 15 fort save.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Natural 16.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** 22.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** So good to go.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** But minus two to AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Just crazy.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Okay.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:38]** So even with the fortitude save that you passed, you are still encumbered for seven rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** And I believe you had done this last time, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** All right.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** So encumbered.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Minus two to AC.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Nicely done.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:48]** You want to do anything else or say anything else on your turn?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** let's put this thing down.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Kiers, you hear this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** What do you do?

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Kiers is impressed.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Nice job.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** And Kiers is going to attempt to daze this alien.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Okay.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:08]** So you got to roll a will save, I think.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** And it's a DC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Good luck.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** DC 15.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Take this.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Good luck.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:17]** Yeah, thanks for wishing the grandmasters like, No.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** In your head.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** He says it sarcastically.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** You said we'll save?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Yeah, it's we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** We'll save.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** We'll save.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** We'll save.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** DC 15, we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** Natural 19.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** Oh, come on.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:36]** This other sharp-edged die, this galaxy die, these two, I think, are my superhero team.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** I've got some backup dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** That's good.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** Here's just gonna get the F out as well in the meantime.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:44]** He's gonna back up into the room a bit and put some distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Okay, so not dazed, right?

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Uh-huh.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** I'm not occurring an AOO if I'm doing this.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Because you're doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Oh, because you're doing a guard step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Oh, wait.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:00]** If the creature's encumbered, can't the creature not take attacks of opportunity anyway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** This creature's not encumbered.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** It's not carrying anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** No, but it's encumbered from Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Yeah.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Oh!

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Yeah, he slowed him down.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Yeah, didn't we just talk about that last time?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Can't do AOO?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** It can't do an AOO if it's encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** I don't think I'm close enough anyway.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** You have to be right next to it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** If you move out of a square in which it threatens.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Am I threatened?

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** No, you're not.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** No, you're not threatened.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Let's see.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Let me just go to encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** All of your speeds are reduced by 10.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:34]** Your maximum dexterity to your class is reduced to plus 2, and you take a minus 5 penalty strength.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Yeah, there's nothing about being...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** Wait, I have it here.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** You cannot run charge.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:45]** You take a minus one penalty to AC, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, reflex saves, initiative checks, and strength and dex-based skills.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** What are you reading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** I mean, like, I'm looking at encumbered on the core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** It's starjammersd.com, game mastering.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** SRD.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** You take a minus two penalty to AC, and you cannot take action.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** I'm reading it right out of the core rulebook on page 235.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** I think you're looking at a different one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:07]** Well, I was reading, I also saw you also take a minus two penalty AC and you cannot take reactions or make attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Is that D&D or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** No, it's Star Jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** I'm also on Star Jammer SRD and I don't see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** And I'm on Encumbered.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:18]** Here, I'll put the link in our Slack chat.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Okay.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** 275.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** Oh, it's saying fatigued.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, that's fatigued.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Totally different.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Yep.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** All right, cool.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Good talk here.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** You're not in the threatened square.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** You don't need to worry about moving out.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** So you step back.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** You tried to daze it.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Was that your standard action and your move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** Yeah, so my move is getting further away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:44 - 00:37:06]** slightly further away okay like here i think okay all right yeah in the blackness yep yep i can see you um so okay that's the top but it's the end of that round we are now at the top of the next round and as here steps away you all do feel like a

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** And maybe Nico and Dr.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:15]** O.K., you can see in the room beyond that any light that you see dust start to fall down.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:20]** And it seems like the ceiling in there, something is about to happen.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** And, oh, not that square.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** You hear this loud...

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:34]** As a rock falls in the next room, and I'm going to point it right where it falls.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:39]** It falls directly onto the working device that is in the corner.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:45]** This massive rock from the ceiling falls and smashes this device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:50]** The working device that we couldn't even get near because this damn bounder is tacked to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Yeah, I rolled the D12 to see which square it landed in.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** It's now broken.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** It landed in the first square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** It's no longer the working device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** GG device.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:57]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** The formerly working device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Thank you for your efforts, device.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** The formerly working device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** Formerly known as the working device.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Unemployed.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** We can't, like, see, though, anyway, can we?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Are these doors closed?

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** I can't remember.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** No, they're slightly open, right?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** That's right.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** That's right.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Because Nico had opened it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:23]** Nico's so, like, obsessed with computers that, like, he's glancing at this thing every couple seconds, and he sees the rock fall on it, and just, like, all hopes and dreams are gone.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:31]** He doesn't care how close he is to death, it's that computer is like right there in reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** In his brain, he hears the screams of the device.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** The screams of a thousand people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:40]** Mika literally is looking at this like, why?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** He just starts crying.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** It's true because he's dropping to his knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Something's happening to Mika.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Scraping the ground.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Nico's been turning into some... I don't know.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** You've noticed it, right?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** He's having these weird moments, I guess.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** He's merging with technology, so he probably feels it's a pain.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Whatever the new Nico is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** What are you doing, computer man?

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:05]** So, John, I am curious if taking a full withdrawal will invoke an attack of opportunity right now.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** You mean the technical term, full withdrawal?

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:11]** The full withdrawal, if I'm moving out of one square...

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** And it takes my whole turn.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** I'm not invoking an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** So it says you can move up to twice your speed.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** Hold on.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** I just lost that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** I'm going to it, too.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Full actions.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Withdraw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** You can move up to double your speed.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:28]** The square you start out is not considered threatened by any opponent.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** You can see.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** Therefore, visible enemies don't get to make attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that square.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:42]** So my issue with it is that he'd be leaving the first threatened squared, but he moves into another threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:48]** So I think once you move out, then when you move out of that second square, you would get an AOA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** Which isn't fair for a full withdrawal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:57]** If during the process of withdrawing you move out of a threatened square other than the one in which you started, enemies can make attacks and opportunity as normal.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** It literally just says that at the end of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** All right.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:06]** Nico's going to take a guarded step back once, and then he's going to take another guarded step back out of the threatened square.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** You can only take one guarded step.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** I can only take one guarded step?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** That is your whole move action is that guarded step.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** So wait, did here's move?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Here's move to stat.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:19]** So if you want, you could take it and roll the dice and see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** Well, no, he could do another... He could take a move action as a standard action.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:28]** So he would waste his action, his standard action, to do another guarded stat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** Good point.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Or just do another full withdrawal.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** No, a full withdrawal is a full action.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Yeah, so you could take another guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Guarded step.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Yep.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** So I'm going to take a second guarded step behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** And just leave her to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** It's cool.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Yep.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** Sorry, you got some health I don't.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** I'm surprised you didn't jump jet out of there.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Well, jump jet isn't necessarily a guarded move out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** I mean, why not in close quarters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:02]** The way Nico does this is after getting stabbed that first time, he's got a little bit of blood in his mouth.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Yeah.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** And so he just spits it at the gray bounder.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** As you jump jet away.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:15]** And then he spits it at the creature, steps back with his sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** That would be your standard action.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** That's an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** That's not an attack.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** That's just flavor.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** And then he does a guard setback and another guard setback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** It loves the taste of blood.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** It does love the taste of blood.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** It's funny.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** Good job, but I'm scared for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** Yeah, I'm very scared for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** These greys have egos, if you haven't noticed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** They do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** Or at least Axios, or whatever the hell his name was last time, did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Estomi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** Estomi, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** That was a pretty funny and graphic way of doing that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Is that your entire turn, Nico?

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** Do you say anything else?

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** No, that's literally all he does.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** No words.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:05]** He just spits blood at the creature and takes two guarded steps away.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Okay.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** I like it.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** Good.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:14]** It is that creature's turn.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:20]** Nico steps away as it was trying to deal with the effects of Dr.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** O.K.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** 's injection.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:26]** And as a result, it could not make an attack for opportunity.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** But then it sees Rick having lost

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:37]** reaching out for this weapon, like Thor with his hand.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:48]** And for that split second in which Rick is not looking at the creature, just that hair fraction of a second, it attacks Rick.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Oh, no, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Rick, you can make it.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** You can do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** Yeah, you can.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** You can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** You can do this, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** We've been through so much more.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:00]** I'm going to roll this purple die because it literally doesn't roll below 10 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** John, you're going to have a crappy roll.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** I'm just going to call it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** What are the odds on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** What's your bonus towards this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** I'm not going to tell you.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** Nick, I'll give you five bucks that I hit.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** All right.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** You're going to pay?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Five bucks.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Lunch next time we eat.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Let's do it.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Lunch next time we eat.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** All right.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Natural 1.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** It technically hit a die, but I'm going to play it because it's fine.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** And I'm going to remove the rest of the die from my tray.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** I rolled a 3.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** So what's your total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** My total, however, is 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Are you f***ing serious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Holy Jesus Christ.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Does it hit?

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Yeah, that f***ing hits.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** All right.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** I have, like, the best armor out of the group.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** F*** you, John.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** What the hell?

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** That's against KAC, dude.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** KAC.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** Yes, my KAC is 14.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Does anybody else have higher?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** No.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** With some modifications, I think I do.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** But that's debatable.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I got to talk to John about that.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** But basically, no.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Not naturally.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** No.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:08]** I have the highest AC, and you can't miss that, apparently.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** This creature is super overpowered.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** It's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** I think you can have much higher cases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** You haven't given us any better armor, and we haven't been able to shop for anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** I'm rolling the D6 that I got from Munchkin.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** I rolled a 5.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** That's 12 points of damage.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:30]** As this thing bites into Rick19's leg, you need to roll a will save, Rick19.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** This is intense, dude.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:38]** This is quickly moving from... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:46]** As it bites Rick19, you feel the psychic compression course through your body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Yep.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** Four plus something stupid.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** A will save, you said?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Will save.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Where's my will?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Will save.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Where's my will?

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** Will save.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Where's my will?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Will save.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Will save.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** That's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** The psychic terror overwhelms you.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** You're shaken for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Wait, Kev, do you have a punishment?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** No.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:15]** Oh, I think I do, but I can't use it after the fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Yep.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** All right.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** We need to talk about that.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** You're shaken for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Who has punishments?

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** Let's make sure before we roll any more dice who has punishments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** Well, did we really reset them on book two or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Yeah, we did.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Why?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** So sad.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** Rick19, you weren't hit with this before, right?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:34]** I think you're the first person in this combat to be hit with it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** I definitely wasn't hit this combat.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** That was the first time I took damage.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** It'll probably be the last time you take damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Okay.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:59]** Nico, you have a feeling, maybe, as you were stepping back, you saw this happening, and you were like, and you saw the bite, and maybe you see in Rick19's eyes, and you recognize it's the same overwhelming psychic terror that tried to overwhelm you, and you realize that... This damn nimbus die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** Sorry, I'm still mad at this.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:05]** is I had a crack die on a 17 and a 10 earlier, and I re-rolled it.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I'm never using these nemesis again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** So here's the thing, Nico.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:14]** If you were to be hit again because you succeeded, you are immune for an hour.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:19]** So I'm just telling you that now from the psychic terror effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:26]** We're starting to get, this is a pretty tough, yeah, it's getting pretty tough.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** This is a tough gun.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** And I like it.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Rick19, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** It's not just tough, it's stupid tough.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** Like we just said, this thing cannot miss us, even if it tried.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** And it hits us with a minimum of 12 points of damage every time.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** It's stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** It's stupid.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:45]** But you guys did have a lot of easier combats before this, so... Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** What are you doing?

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** You're shaking.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** He quits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** He quits?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** He just gives up.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** You incur an attack for opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Sorry.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** F*** this.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I'm leaving.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** F*** this.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** I'm leaving.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** I don't think I've ever heard Rick curse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:11]** Rick, you know, he takes the hit real hard and his eyes are literally glowing red because he's an android and they have LEDs in them.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** And he just kind of blindly reaches back.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:21]** He knows that Dr. Oki is handing him that axe and so he just kind of reaches back and he wraps his hand around the handle

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:45]** and he just one-headed swings it as hard as he can all the way around like towards his head make sure you have your minus two no he's got a minus one minus two from shaking no but i gave you a plus one yep so it's a minus one oh oh yeah and what was what is the penalties on shaking um no from the critical fail last time oh that was just throwing the weapon that was it you're fine

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** Oh, I thought there was like a minus one plus one thing that you talked about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Nope.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** We cut that whole thing because the whole point was the extreme thing.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** So you're fine.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** So you threw it.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Oh, I get it.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** Sorry.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** I was confused.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** So I get a minus one.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** I get a plus one from Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** Yep.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** And a minus two from being shaken.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** So it's a minus one on your attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:12]** You know that this thing is encumbered, so you know that AC is... Do you have a punishment?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Does anybody want to give him a punishment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** I have a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** He has a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** I thought I had a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** You want to use it?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** He does.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** I'm going to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** You're going to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Yeah!

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** First use of punishment.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** The punishment economy is starting.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Okay, okay.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** I'm going to actually just roll both d20s at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:35]** Well, pick which one is your actual one and which one is your punishment one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Why does that matter?

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** It's the higher of the two.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:49]** Okay, but I'm putting them against each other, so I have my Q Workshop Starfinder dice versus my free Roller Crit dice that I got from Gen Con.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Ooh, pretty close on both.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** I got a 15 on one and 18 on the other.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** So 18 plus four is a 22 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, I can imagine that right as it bit you and started to move away, it just didn't see the anger with which you just grip onto this axe and just swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** I got a retcon.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** I don't actually give you a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** So it's still 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** That's fine.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** What did you give me then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:29]** I don't think I can unless I can give you a minor booster, which gives you a plus four bonus to your next saving throw.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Oh, okay.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** I'll save that then.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** That's fine.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Okay, so it still hits, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:41]** I think I can't do that and shoot him in the same turn, so I didn't actually... I'm just handing you the weapon.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I can't do anything else.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** No worries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** So you hit, you swing, and you hit.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** You cut this creature.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** How much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** D12 of damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:50]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** You gotta roll high if you wanna end this combat.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** It's a d12 plus four.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Okay.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** And... That's eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Wow.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:11]** It looks like the black, viscous fluid that's coming out of the damage that you've given it.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** It looks severely injured.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:16]** There is a chance that you all could take this down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:22]** But that black fluid, that blood fluid coming from it starts melting the axe because it's acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Hold on.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** It's not overpowered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** It's all right.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** Hold on.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Hold on.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:38]** Not to get in our own way here, but did Kevin take a roll to see if he was able to get through the phasing out thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** He did not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Good point.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Good point.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Thanks, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** Thank you, Nick, for pointing that out.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** Nick is that person who was like, hey, teacher, I think you forgot to collect our homework.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** That's it.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** The rules give it and the rules take it away.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** Get a 20 or lower.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Get a 20 or lower.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** 20 or lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:03]** I'm losing all my dice here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** 20 or lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** F*** you, Nick.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** What'd you get?

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** What happened?

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Ouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:24]** So he swings that axe and it hits it and then the thing phases and it goes right through and hits the wall.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** F*** you, Nick.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** F*** this game.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** I'm so angry right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** If I die from this, Nick, it's your fucking fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** I fully acknowledge that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:40]** With zero health, he knocks on the door, pisses the thing off, and then runs away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Ding dong ditch.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** I mean, I thought as a rules lawyer, you should be happy.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** You should be happy.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Seriously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** What can you do?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** It is your turn.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** I don't think Rick19 has any other swear words he wants to say on his turn.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** So, Dr. K, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** I guess I have to shoot him again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Wait, is the creature still shaken?

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:01]** Was the creature still shaken when it attacked you?

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** No, I'm shaken.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** You were shaken this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** No, the creature's encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:11]** The creature should have been shaken, though, from the last combat because I succeeded on my combat expertise.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Running away?

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** No, I succeeded on my combat expertise.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** How'd you do a combat expertise?

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** You did two guarded steps.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** You did do a combat expertise.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Last game.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Was that shaken?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Yeah, it was shaken.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It was shaken for one round?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** It was shaken for one round, so when it attacked me, it was still shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Yeah, but the shaken would... Let's see.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** It still, I think, would have... Because it rolled pretty high on you, right?

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Okay.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** You tell me, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** That would have saved me from my... John, what's the... No, but it was shaken for one round, so it would have been the round that it attacked Nico, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** John, it's phase roll.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** What is that?

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** Attack, dex, will.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** What is that where it rolls for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** It's just a... The phase?

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** It's like being... Yeah.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Concealment.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Or the psychic chair.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** It's just a roll D100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** The phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** The phase is just roll a mischance.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** 20% mischance.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** It's just a phase.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Just a phase, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** If the creature's debuffed...

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** by encumbered or something like that.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** Does that affect it at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** My puns are wasted on you guys.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** That was good, Nick.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:16]** Paizo is pretty clear about special effects, special abilities.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:20]** If there's something that affects that, they usually say typically.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:26]** I find there's less gray area in Paizo rules than there are in other systems.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Except for the Bounder.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** The Bounder is completely gray.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** The Bounder of Super Greg.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** So it does make sense that it was shaken last time.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** It still would have hit you, Nico, because I thought I rolled a crazy high number, right?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:41]** I rolled like a 30 to hit you, so it still would have hit you.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Oh, yeah, you did.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Yeah, so it still would have hit you.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** What are you doing?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** This was good, quick discussion.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Can you kill it?

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Yeah.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** You... Well, that's right.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Rick didn't do the damage, so...

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** If you guys get some good hits, maybe you can kill it this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** If we can hit it at all in the time that it kills us first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** That's the name of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Dr. K, what are you thinking?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:14]** Yeah, I'm going to switch over to this transmutation matrix weapon.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** I like it.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** There we go.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** The vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** You love to see it.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:27]** I don't know how this is going to turn out, but let's see how it punches.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** Let's see how this baby punches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Wait, doesn't it take five minutes to transform it or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** No, I think it was already in the pistol form.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Okay, just checking.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** It is unwieldy, which is interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** Yeah, there's this chance that it can miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** You can't attack with it.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** I don't think that's it.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** I think that you can't use it as part of a full attack.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** You can't attack with it more than once per round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:02]** Can't be fired without cooling down first or otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Okay, so I can really only use it once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:10]** Yeah, I think unwieldy just means in one round you can only shoot it once and you can't use it for an AOL.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Yeah.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Okay, but you pull it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** Yeah, so here's the thing, though.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:21]** But creatures adjacent to the target take amount of damage listed in the... What?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** It has a pulse.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** This weapon's output explodes in a pulse of energy.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** That's the critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** But it has an AoE effect on anyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** Dealing damage to nearby creatures, but most find the feat difficult to replicate consistently, so it only happens on a crit.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** So if you crit with this, you might deal 1d4 damage to Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** That's cool.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** But you would also deal an extra d4 to the king.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:46]** And it does two types of damage, right?

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** It looks like electric and fire.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** It's pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:58]** This little ball of... I'm going to roll my... My good buddy from Gen Con gave me some sweet die.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Good old pals.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Yeah.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Oh, yeah, at Rolocrit?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** Yep.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** That is 15.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:13]** And the die plus three is 18.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** 18 is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Wait, I'm on the wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:28]** As this little crackling ball appears in the center of, like, what I feel like is a small satellite dish at the front, this little pin.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:28]** Yeah.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** Probably leaves this cool star-like trail as it flies towards the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** I got max damage.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Six.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Yeah!

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Wait.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Did you roll a mischance?

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** No, I didn't.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Roll a mischance.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** So, what do I roll?

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** D100.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** D100.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:44]** Get below 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Less than 20 misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** I got a 66.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** You're good!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:54]** Six damage as it pierces.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** Seven.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** You're getting it slowly but surely.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Electrical and fire damage.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Electric fire damage.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:11]** I feel like the little ball is like a BB that just goes through and just sinks into the creature.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:16]** And you just don't see it as it cuts through some whatever internal organs are there.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** You want to do anything else on your turn, Doctor?

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:40]** uh nope that's about it that's it here's what are you doing very nice here's gives him a thumbs up and uh he's gonna roll he's gonna take full action to do magic missile which is three missiles and that can't miss because it's a force effect so i'm gonna actually drop the hell yeah thank you well i'm not gonna drop it but i'm gonna put it away okay the vapor cavitation pistol


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** Well, technically pulling it out would have been your move action, so you would have to drop it.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Right, right, right.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Come on, Hears.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Come on.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Come on, old buddy.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Don't let me down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** Is there the phase chance for a magic missile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** No, there's not.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** It's a force attack.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** So it's just nine points of damage, though, straight into its face.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Come on, come on.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Wow.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** Wow.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** The phase.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Amazing.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Amazing.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:11]** It hits, and you can see that it's weakly limping.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** It was just constantly moving.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** This creature is always, even in the square, it's jumping back and forth.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Its tail is moving.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:25]** Its body is racing like it can move anywhere, anytime, and it wants to.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** and you hit it, but it's still up.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** You're close.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** You're close.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:36]** You can tell that its movements have been slowed already, but now it seems unsure on its footing with your hit.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** That's all I can do.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** That's all that you can do.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:45]** Rick19, you missed with your attack.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** It is the top of the next turn.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Let's see.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:53]** I'm going to roll here as you all feel...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** I was out of nowhere.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** And Rick, you failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Just reminding you that you failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** You also threw your axe over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** You want to switch to another weapon, Rick?

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** Maybe like... Something lighter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:19]** You feel the ground start to shake again as it seems like the ceiling is going to drop another stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Oh, come on.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** It falls right on the gray.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** So perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:35]** There is another stone that you hear in the similar area to where that first stone fell.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:39]** The second stone falls over against the wall.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** You hear it against the eastern wall.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** Boom.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** And there's dust.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:46]** Some dust trickles in from the small gap in the door.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** As you all realize, this place is not getting any more stable.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:55]** Nico, what are you doing behind cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:00]** Nico, behind cover a little bit, is just going to be like, hey, ugly.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:08]** And then he's just going to wipe at his face, trying to get the creature to notice that he's got blood on his face from when Nico spat on it.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Oh.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:16]** And Nico is going to do another combat expertise and roll a bluff check.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Okay.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Give me a bluff check.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** And he's going to take a check.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** And he's going to take a shot.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** It's 15 plus one and a half to CR, right?

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Yep.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Okay.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** And I get my full bonuses.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Bonus, bonus, bonus.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** All righty.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Bonus, bonus, bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Bonus, bonus, bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** What did you get?

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** 14 plus 9.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** 23?

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Yeah.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:50]** Okay, so it seems like for a second, weirdly, because you don't know that the creature is intelligent enough to know what's going on, but it almost like winks back at you.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** Like, what are you talking about?

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** And you succeed on your bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Yep.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]** So Nico's then going to take a shot.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** Also, by the way, the creature's now shaken.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Okay.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Shaken for one round?

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** Shaken for one round, and then Nico's going to be taking a shot with his azimuth laser pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** And he gets to add a D6 on the damage roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** He does.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** If he hits.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Make sure you roll that 20% mischance.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:17]** All righty.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** So that is.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:26]** Oh, and I also get to add the full bonus for hitting, too.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** So standard action.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** What did you roll to hit on a T20?

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** What did I roll to hit?

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** So I rolled a 14 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** I rolled a 14.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Wait.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Natural 14.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:37]** Plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** You hit with your 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Hold on.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Hold on.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:45]** I just want to make sure I do this right.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:51]** In any case, I get to use the full... Or wait, is that double tap?

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** Gotta know your characters.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** This attack gains a plus one to the bonus attack runoff.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** All right, 14 hits anyway.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** We'll just go ahead and say that.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** Now I got to roll my mischance.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** Wait, how am I rolling my mischance again?

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** D100.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** D100, okay, good to know.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** All right, because I just rolled a D20.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** There's the D100, and then I got to roll D10.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:16]** You roll a D10 and then a D100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:16]** Perfect.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** All right.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:18]** You ready?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Yeah, I'm ready.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Ooh, close.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** Okay.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** So you do hit.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:29]** It does go through and hit the creature with your pistol, right?

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Your pistol.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Okay.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** So D4 plus a D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Ooh, could you do it?

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** Could this be when you take the creature out?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Could this be it?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:42]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** What'd you roll?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** Double ones.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Oh!

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]** You gotta be kidding me.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** What do you mean double ones?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:55]** Plus anything?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** I think it's plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** Don't think.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Check.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** Hero Lab.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** Thanks, Hero Lab.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:31]** uh it's a plus four to hit so it was 18 to hit that's fine no no but your damage the damage it's a d4 plus something it says 1d something plus uh for your pistol it's like 1d6 you guys gotta know your characters yeah plus like three kind of know what you can do what you can't do hold on it just doesn't make it's just a favorite cavitation pistol


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** No.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** It's the plus four to hit.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** It's just a 1d4, I think.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Yeah, I thought it was just 1d4.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Wait, hold on.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** I might get something for my... What pistol do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** It's an azimuth laser pistol.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** It says 1d4 plus one.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Okay, it does?

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** Yeah.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:48]** In the middle column where your weapon is, it should... Okay, so 1d4 plus one.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** So it's three points of damage.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** Again, looking like it is so close to death.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** You could have killed it.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** So close.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** But instead... Instead...

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** It wants to finish the job.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** It's going to take a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** Instead, it has an extra 24 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** Because it rested while you guys rested.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** No, I already figured that out.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:17]** It takes a guarded step forward, and it tries to, like, flavor.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:26]** It jukes out Rick and Dr. Okay, trying to see as if it could avoid an A-O-O as its guarded step.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** Pounce, pounce, pounce.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** And then pounce to bite at

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** Nico, get ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** Yeah, that's what you get for spitting on its face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** You spit on its face and then you hit it.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** I'm rolling the glassy purple.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** You have... It's a natural 17.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** 29 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:49]** Do you want to tell us how much life you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** How much life do you have?

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** I posted it up in our Slack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:59]** I have between... You don't have to say it's Team PC.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Although...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:04]** I have 13 points between health and stamina remaining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** Okay, you might... Did you take a hit since then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** Okay, so you have... Stabilize him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:15]** So you have 13 points between health and stamina.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:16]** That's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** I don't get... Oh, yeah, you took a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Took a guarded step.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]** You're immune to the psychic terror, but I'm just going to say this.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** I'm going to write down what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Write down the number real big so I can hold it up to the screen.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:35]** The damage from the bite is 1d6 plus 7.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:39]** If I roll a 6, you're down.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:42]** That's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]** That's our game.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Of course it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:51]** Of course it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** Did you already roll it?

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Nope.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:56]** You would.

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** Piece of shit.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** Until next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** Until next time.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** Until next time.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** Until next time.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** You should do the outro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** Until next time on We'll Seek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01
