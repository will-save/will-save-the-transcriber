**[00:00:13 - 00:00:24]** True to form, Rick lets loose and puts an end to these dogs' abuse by loosening one hound from his head, decapitating the diamond dog after several rounds of combat.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:39]** With one Tashtari down, the crew makes a hasty retreat back into the comms room as Hears and Chad try to trick the Tashtari into giving up its ambitions of becoming a corpse, only to witness another green orb transporting the beast out of reach.

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:44]** Will our triumvirate live to tell the tale of their test lab triumphs?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** I have the definition.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** mailbox 963.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** 963.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Kelly has the knowledge.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Yes.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** All right.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I have the knowledge.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:07]** So grunts are defined as relatively short monosyllabic utterances.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** It's an utterance.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** You noobs.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** You plebes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:16]** According to dictionary, I just typed in hmm definition and it says it's an exclamation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** But that's not hmm.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:24]** I started looking it up, Kelly, and I will post the link later.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:34]** But I stumbled upon how to use non-linguistic utterances to convey emotion in child robot interaction white paper.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Very specific.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:48]** How to use non-linguistic utterances to convey emotion in child-robot interaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** You'll find this white paper linked on our website shortly, I'm sure.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** At the release of this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** That is great.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** It has to go on the website.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Yes.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Fascinating.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** That will be a thing, though, child-robot interactions.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** It's good they're writing papers on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** And it should be non-linguistic.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Like so, non-linguistic meaning.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Gestures and stuff like that.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Yeah.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** Utterances.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Go fig.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Exclamations.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:27]** An exclamation, it could be maybe called an exclamation too, maybe.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** Is there a favorite word that somebody has or favorite utterance now?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Besides mm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** I can't say.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** Idiosyncratic.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Idiosyncratic.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Great work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** That is a good, okay, so words, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Or utterances.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** See?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** See?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** I mean, I have, like, my common one is say again, because I can never hear anybody the first time.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** My brain kind of functions slow, I think.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** Like, I'm slow to receive information, and so I have to process it.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** So by the time I say say again, then my brain goes like, oh, that's what they said.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Yeah.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** And it's like, never mind.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:15]** well your input stream is limited for your uh yeah your input stream is limited limited bandwidth um yeah now you're smart you're smart you launch spacex rockets come on you're good but um

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** There's no doubt he's smart.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Yeah.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Just the input stream is low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** His processing speed is hindered, though.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** I see.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** It's the hardware upgrade.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** You need an M1 chip, Kev.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]** He's like a CISC chip, and we need a RISC chip or an ARM chip.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** Back to the arm that you were talking about last time, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** I like there's a British sort of expression.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:43]** I don't know how you would define it, but it says, like, it might do or I might do.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** And, like, on YouTube, most of the people I watch are British.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** It just happens to be that way.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, and that's not considered, I guess, proper American English.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** But I do say that often as a result.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** I say...

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** does it work this way?

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Someone will ask.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** I'd be like, it might do, you know, that kind of thing.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** If there are any of our listeners in the UK, could do, could do.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Feel free to comment.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:06]** Yeah.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** There could be, there could do.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Wait, no, that wouldn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:16]** I don't, I'm times like slipping by so fast and I don't want to forget, but happy birthday.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Well, your birthday was yesterday.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Oh, yes, it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Yeah.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Do we need to sing it to you?

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Will, you don't seem excited.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** That's an interjection.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Do you hear it in his voice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** Yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** How old are you now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** 48?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** 500 years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** Shari's lived a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** Uh, I'm hoping that my MacBook finally arrived.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** That's your present.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** There it is.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** To myself that I put a lot of money down for.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** That's a great present.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** It's a great present.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** It's good.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** It's good.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:59]** It's good to recognize our wonderful Will's birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Thank you.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** No relation to the podcast naming.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** None at all.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Should be no.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** None at all.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Two totally different families.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** Yeah.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Two families of wills.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Two families of wills.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** True test of will.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Yes.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes, though, from everyone.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:24]** I'm sure that as soon as people are hearing this right now, they're jumping on Discord.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** They're sending all the gifs.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Yeah, they're blowing it up.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** All the emojis.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** And I'd be really surprised if they didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** Yeah, this is... So that was kind of a two... This is our zero year.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** This is our first year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Year two.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:30]** Well, I guess last year was year two, but this is the real true year two episode.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** So thank you all for being so awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** I think this is year one.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Because the race started at zero.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** So this is year one.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** Thank you everyone for being fantastic.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** Because Will wants to go back in time and not be 48.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Yeah.

**[00:09:47 - 00:10:17]** not be 500 just be 499 499 is a good number yeah i mean for no shower 500 is nothing but you know yeah we'll still very moist and everything as you can tell dr okay is skincare games on point also uh possibly cut this but apologies there's definitely a lag on my end so i'm very sorry if this becomes a problem i will do something so if i'm interrupting you it's not on purpose

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** It's all good.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Do you want to disconnect?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** I am going to do that.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** I'll be right back.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** I'll be right back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** I think what will happen is that in the episode, as soon as Kelly is like, Hey guys, I'm going to disconnect.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** I'll play something for five seconds.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** And that'll be like, Hey, Kelly's back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** Hello.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** All right.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Marco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Marco.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Great.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Fantastic.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** Look at us killing it.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** All right, so let's play.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Let's jump in.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Let's do it.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:58]** It's been a week since you took out some laser wolves.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Am I right?

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** The other one got away.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** That's very true.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** One got away.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** The one that got away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:10]** Wait, I have a question just about the effectiveness of the ghost thing so that I know for the future.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:16]** Did that have any effect whatsoever on pushing that wolf to get the hell out of there, or that was totally just a coincidence?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** That totally helped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Okay, cool.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** All right, sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** That's always going to help.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:28]** If I hadn't just beasted those saves from before, yeah, I mean, that would absolutely help.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** Yeah, so that's always going to help.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Yay, ghost sound.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Yay, ghost sound.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:43]** So, the big question for you all right now is what are you going to do next?

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** You are armed with information now.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** The most dangerous weapon.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:57]** Because now you know that you need to escape this place.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:09]** And the only way to do that is by shutting down, fixing, repairing something to stop these reactors, one in particular, from melting down.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** Right now, I'm going to move you over to the page number 20.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:24]** And last week, you left armed with that knowledge, went into the hallway, two green portals come out.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:43]** two Tash Tari's laser wolves come out pretty, not as crazy fight, but definitely the fight to get your Jimmy's up a little bit, get a little nervous, keep you on edge, nervous in the service, nervous in the service.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** That's what that's the official military motto.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:54]** And thanks to some clever thinking, thanks to some smart tactics, uh,

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:16]** some great hits you kill one of them scare the other one off realizing probably best and it disappears into the green portal down the hall you are currently inside a room with bernice dr okay rick and here's

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:23]** The guardian robot is still over on the floor.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** The door is closed.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Somehow, you all need to move.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** You need to find out where to go.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** What are your thoughts?

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:41]** I was going to ask, did the stewards tell us kind of a general direction of where the thing was from where we were?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** I don't recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Pretty sure they did.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:59]** Well, they you were talking to Shay and pretty sure Shay let you know that basically assuming that where you are at is at all like where they're at.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:12]** then the reactors seem to be on a lower level, so you need to look for a place to go down and probably some sort of a shaft, probably some tunnels.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** It's probably something.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** That's right.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** And you need to find that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** We have open communication with them.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:24]** We have this terminal, but also I think our comm devices are connected to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** We do.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:28]** And I wonder if they're listening to that whole fight going like, oh, God, these guys are going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:39]** yeah here's they probably were thinking that like we were for sure i i here's wants to uh communicate with them he has an important question to ask so he's gonna try to do that

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** Okay, so you... I'll use the terminal so I can see the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** Okay.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Did you move us to the map?

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** Oh.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Okay.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** You know what?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I didn't know if I was just delayed.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Thanks for keeping me on my toes, Kev.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** That's my combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Keep me on my toes.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** Does anyone have any other thoughts before I do this?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** I know I'm jumping into an action here, so...

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** How does Heir say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:09]** Heir says, like, I need to know if it's safe for us to take some time to recover, so I want to call them real quick, ask them, because they know better the situation that we're in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:19]** They did tell us that the reactors were going to... Well, Rick will say, like, they informed us that these reactors are going to go through the sanitation process in 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** Well, that gives us enough time to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** Or... If it only takes us that time to get them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** I'm just saying, like...

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:32]** Here's the same, like, I'm useless unless I sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** We have 24 hours.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** I feel like we cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** I want to make sure we live long enough to shut these things down.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:50]** And at the rate that things are going, we're running into enemy after enemy around every corner.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** I don't want that to happen again and be unprepared.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** You're also not that well right now, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** That is very true.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:04]** I just don't know if we have enough time remaining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** I want to gamble that we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** Not to be... Well, you said you were going to ask that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** I'm going to ask.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** So here's like dials up the frequency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Okay.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** You walk over to the communication.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Dial up the frequency.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Okay.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** What do you say?

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** The line opens.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** The comm opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Do we see anyone?

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Is she there?

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:32]** Are you... Oh, here it just says, uh, hello?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Uh, hello?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** Like that.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** Okay.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, I mean, the first face that pops up that you see is the face of Gnarla.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Her face pops up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Yes.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** You have a question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Yeah.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:02]** Do you think you said, right, that it's going to be about 24 hours before these reactors blow?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** That is a possibility.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:15]** I am not on the whatever it is, but that is a possibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:20]** And right as she says that, Shay's face also pops up.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** And he says, yeah, from what I'm looking at here, it really, it could be less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** And I'm getting nervous the closer that I'm getting to this reactor that it could be less.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** All right, how much less are we talking?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** I don't know.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** I'm not a scientist who knows reactors.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:45]** I think, what are you trying to get at here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:53]** A lot of us are pretty weathered, and we don't know if we're going to be able to get through any more enemies at this point.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:57]** We've encountered so many in such a short amount of time in a short, a small amount of locations.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** We're worried we can't survive long enough to help you.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** So, can you advise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** Hold on, let me just, like, teleport you some, like... Yeah, that would be great.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Healing serums.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** You just get a... Do you like mangoes?

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Here's some spell cash.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** Will this ship take a whole day to go through?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** Yeah.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** How far away is it?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Are these reactors?

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** The reactors are on a lower level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:30]** I don't think the footprint of where you're at, if it's similar to where we are, is that big.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** But I get it.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** I've lost people already.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** I understand.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Oh, geez.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** This is a dangerous place.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** We're in a tight spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:46]** I want to help you out, and I think Gnarla does too, but I'm worried something could happen.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:56]** If you're going to take this chance, then let me know, and we will do our best to cover you, to try and hold things off.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:01]** I don't know what that means, but we need to get out of here.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** That's my MO.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Get out of here.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Turn off these reactors as fast as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** All right.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:13]** Here's just turns around and looks at the crew and he's like, this is this is for me, but for us, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** But it's it's a hard decision.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:25]** So I'll I'll I'll leave it up to you to vote in on it, because I can't I can't obviously unilaterally make that decision to rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Doctor, OK, what are your thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** I don't know if we have enough time to go through this whole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:55]** mess i mean a rest looks really nice as i look at my stamina and everything else going on yes we can rest oh wow i wasn't expecting that we just have to double time it to to downstairs let's try and i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** Gnarla pops on the go.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:07]** Gnarla chimes in and says, There will be plenty of accommodations as soon as you are aboard the Voidcrier.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I can assure you of that.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** The Voidcrier?

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:14]** But until you get here, we don't have anything to help you.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:20]** My resources are already stretched with Shay and making sure they get back as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Does Dr. O'Kane need a rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** How are you doing, Doc?

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:35]** I have full stamina from the 10-minute, but I am down below my middle in hit points, and I could use some resolve points as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** So you do have serums of healing.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** You do have the relax you.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** Obviously, this place is like, you might find other things, you might not.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** That's just to let you know, just to remind you that you have resources.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** That's not to influence you in any way.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** That's just to say that you do still have those as well.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:54]** Because obviously, even with a long rest, you won't necessarily get all your hit points back.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** So, yeah.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Shay jumps in.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** Look, we're really dealing with a lot here.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** Let me know if you're going to do this or not.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** I got to get back to it.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** I'll see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** Do you know if there's anyone else here?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Anyone that you're aware of that we're going to encounter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Tell us which monsters are where.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** They know some shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** They might know something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** I don't know.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:24]** This place seems pretty f***ed up.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** I'm not going to lie to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Crazy idea, but what if this is all just part of the simulation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** I think it is.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** The stewards aren't actually communicating with us.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Oh my god, don't do this to me.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:40]** It's like the greys have a program.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** I can believe it for the portals and the way they work and everything.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** It's like some stupid game.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** And the kids are laughing at us from that flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:48 - 00:22:13]** look the kids are laughing at here's like the laughter raising your ears yeah just see here's going this internal turmoil right now they're like the entire time do you have fear of dog tears is that what's up uh no it's not talking about it as it chases him through the alleys he says shay jumps back and says look i need to get back to it let narla know or me if you really want to but let narla know what's gonna happen

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** Also, yeah, let us know if you like mangoes because we have a lot of mangoes on The Void Crier.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** So if we get out of here, mangoes would be really nice to eat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** Weirdest conversation I've had in a while, but thanks.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** All right.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Appreciate you too.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Cuts out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:30]** If we are going to rest, we need to barricade these doors.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:36]** But then again, what if these things can just materialize in the room with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Then I have a mechanical question.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:45]** Can you wake up when you're aware of the presence of something sinister like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** Yeah, I think you would probably have somebody take watch, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** I feel like that's what you would probably do.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Right.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** The problem with the watch is that it's using more time.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** That's why I was asking if Dr. O'Kane needs a rest.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:03]** because he seemed like pretty beefy, but from his description, maybe not so much.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:11]** The things, the sort of supplemental like things that we have, like serums, et cetera, that won't, will that be able to like be fine for Dr. Okay?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I would leave it up to your discretion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:42]** doctor I mean I could I'd be fine to stay up and take a watch hmm okay you guys want to do this so what are you guys gonna do rest I think we're gonna rest okay I don't think it's gonna do us much good I feel like we're gonna get attacked but should we all rest then yeah well Bernice can guard Bernice let's let Bernice guard


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Okay.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** So if need be, Bernice will make a perception check?

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Yeah.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Exactly.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Then that way we all get to rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Okay.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** So talk to me.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Do you guys say anything?

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** What are you thinking?

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** This is a scary, isolating feeling.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** You're resting in a room that I'm going to just assume that you lock.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:11]** You have people saying that there's a possible way out, but to get there is going to be hell.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** And a briefcase is taking watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** Yeah.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** Briefcase on monitor mode.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:30]** Bernice is ready to drop the net that we recovered from... Oh, to shoot the night fiber net?

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Yeah.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** Cool.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** That was my...

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** Are the lights still on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** No, the lights came back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** As soon as the dogs disappeared?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** No, they came on before the dogs disappeared.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** They came on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** I don't recall you saying they came back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** They did when it did like an electrical charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** It's cool, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** You don't have to call me out on everything.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** I believe you.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** I'll take your word for it.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** I'm messing with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** Here's goes under this terminal, like, behind this chair and kind of curls up in a ball, like, under the terminal.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Conveniently C-shaped.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yeah.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** Just cries himself to sleep.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** He takes some NyQuil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** What are each of you thinking?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Do you talk?

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** Do you just... What does that look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** Yeah, Rick's going to, like, move away from the door for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** I don't know.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Here's, like...

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:25]** Reflects on the people that he left behind and are no longer with him.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** His family.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** He's a little sad, but he's just worn out.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** So he drops his sleep pretty quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** Fall into a heavy sleep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:42]** Rick seems like you guys just split off to different corners of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Yeah.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:52]** Uh, you know, he's in the corner, he's checking over Bernice here and there on his remote pad, tries to get himself sort of comfortable.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:01]** And he's, uh, sort of reflecting on his, uh, lost companion and friend Boushtakis and, uh, his home world.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** And he misses, uh, he misses, uh,

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:10]** being in the comforts of home and in and study and he's you know

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:39]** he recognizes the importance of where he is right now because there's something going on here that um that touches his world but he's uh very off from his like normal surroundings feels out of he's nervous makes sense he's like an academic you know he's here in the middle of all this yeah bush docus bush docus bush docus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Rick, anything?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:46]** Yeah, Rick doesn't really have anything to talk about.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** He's just focused on surviving.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** And that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Okay.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Chad disappears.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** You feel Chad Preston's leave.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** Yeah, he's gone, I should say.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:01]** He'll be back later.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** You each fall asleep.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** And...

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** I don't know if any of you have any dreams.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** I would imagine not from the exhaustion.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** It's just pass out.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** Heavy slumber for eight hours.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Dr.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** O.K., you never receive anything from Bernice.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:27]** There's never any instance you all wake up.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:35]** The light is now dim and it seems to be going off a lot more frequently.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:41]** It seems like this place is starting to kind of come apart.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** There seems to be some parts of the ceiling.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** There's some more dust that seems to constantly, every once in a while as it shakes, seems to be falling down.

**[00:27:51 - 00:28:00]** Maybe one of you is one of the last to wake up, but you're woken up because a chunk of rock falls right next to where you are.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** Maybe about the size of your fist falls next to where you're sleeping.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** Then you wake up and eight hours have passed.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** You've had a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Feeling refreshed.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Here's stretches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** Everyone okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Everyone okay?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:41]** I'm feeling more relaxed and I've just like, I've been using maybe like the, uh, on standby mode, but I had the, uh, Oh, the relax you, the relax you just, you know, uh, I hacked ASMR, made it give, give more moisture.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Right.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Love it.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** It's just a little, little spritzes every 30 seconds to a minute.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Kind of keep you cool.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** I love it.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** It's awesome.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** All right.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** So what's next?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** You've made it through eight hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** Here's, we'll call the other two.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** I can't remember their names.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** He's going to call them again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** Narla and Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Real quick, Narla and Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:13]** As you look through, you do notice that Narla did send you a message saying, what are you going to do?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Because I feel like you didn't tell him, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Here's replies.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** We slept.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** We would have told them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** This net.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:30]** Are you... Do you have a ranged weapon specialty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Did you find it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** It's the one off the robot.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** I don't think I can use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** I'm trying to look it up, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** It's under weapons.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** It's a one-handed special weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** Oh, knife fiber.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:46 - 00:30:10]** and ny fiber new york fiber the new york fiber you can get it in a new york minute have it in a new york minute the new york fiber one-handed special weapon the best one-handed special weapon above 50th street ranged weapons special weapons proficiency required oh i think what is special weapons proficiency

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** I don't know.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:17]** I'm not a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** I was trying to read about resting and now you're asking me questions about weapons.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** I guess I can hold on to it.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** I'll take it from Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** So you have the knife fiber net now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I guess so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:34]** Yeah, so I was thinking like next time maybe try and entangle them in the knife fiber net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** It says range special weapons proficiency required.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** So I guess I don't have

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Because it's highlighted in red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** More stuff we can't use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** I guess I'll still take it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** John, did it come with, like, a weapon to, like, discharge it?

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** No, it's just the knife I burned out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I don't know.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:59]** It says... Under the description on Hero Lab, it just says it's a thrown weapon.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Yeah.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:04]** But then it says... Then it also says you need the special weapons...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** You're saying that you need a special weapon proficiency to use it?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** According to Hero Lab.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** Looks like there's a feat for special weapon proficiency.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Yeah.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** You gain proficiency in a single special weapon of your choice.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:21]** But if any of you want to use a knife or a brunette...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:52]** could it will definitely be helpful well i think i can use it but it adds all the penalties to it right um so it gives according to hero lab i get a plus one for that throw versus another versus my regular throne attack is um plus five so i think you take a minus four use it yeah i think so i think you're right yep so still worth it could be great maybe except for the dcs are probably


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** 14.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** Well, it's just to hit, right?

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** I mean, it's... I think you're looking at the DC to disentangle.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** To break it, yeah.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** That's after it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** But it's 10 feet, I thought.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Or is it multiple squares?

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** So you can throw it 10 feet.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** And I have a plus one to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** It only does one square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** It's going to be a thrown DC, and thrown DCs are pretty low, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:51]** so here's you notice that there are there's a message from narla saying wia question mark where are you at i respond with slept moving on uh reactors now we're headed for the reactors now any updates he'll ask like they might know something about the state of the reactors or whatever are you message you message them are you calling here's his typing like uh here's a call okay hey narla you there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Hello?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** Yes.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Hello?

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Hey.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Hi.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** So you decided to sleep?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** Yeah, we took some time to recover.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** Any status updates on the reactors?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** We're about to move on them now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** It seems like Shay is close.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** I don't... Perhaps they must have taken time to rest.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** I haven't heard much from them.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:18]** But it seems like they are likely close.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** So whatever you can do, the sooner that we get out of here, the better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Okay.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** We're on it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** All right.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** We'll follow up soon from our comms.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Stand by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** All the speed of Waylon to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Close us out.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** And will Waylon be with you as well?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** And also with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** And also with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** All right.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** So you tell them that you are going to move on.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** You're headed out.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Haven't heard anything from Shay.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Could be good.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Could be bad.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** Unclear.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** And...

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Yeah.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** And they believe they'll explode soon, so we're on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Could be any minute now.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** It seems like the place has absolutely gotten worse.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** More things are starting to fall occasionally from the ceiling.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** The light, again, is low.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** It hasn't come back to full.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** And it goes out a lot more frequently.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Maybe for about five or ten seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Let's look for a way down.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:24]** And here's... I forget if he can perceive through doors, but he will... Can he do that?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Not really, right?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Well, he has blind sense, so he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Yeah.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** You don't sense anything.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Okay.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** And...

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:43]** You would remember too that Chad said that as soon as the Teshtari that went down the hall disappeared into a green portal, there was also a green portal that swallowed up the one that was dead too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Right.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** I appreciate you giving Chad this ability.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** However, he can't do that, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Good to know.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** I don't know if he can like on his own volition, communicate something like for flavor.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:01]** We do add that and he can have a personality back, but I don't know if he can independently make the decision to communicate that to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Got it.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Okay.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Good to know for the future.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** It's fine.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** This is a decision moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** I think we book for the stairs or some sort of shaft or whatever.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:21]** I don't want to tangle in any more of these rooms if we don't have to, but the hallway seems dangerous too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** I concur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** Let's perceive along the way to be safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:30]** I say we move ahead down the hallways and stay out of the rooms until we find this stairwell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:36]** Do we go to the big hallway down the long corridor, or do we go just up?

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Yeah, good question.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** Down this sort of jaunty hallway that we saw?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Do we keep pushing forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:50]** There's a machine on the hallway headed east.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** We could check out what that is on the way.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Maybe that'll have something that'll help us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** That was this thing here?

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Yeah.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** The colorful seashell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** I remember having seen it, yeah, earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** I agree.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** We should go that way and proceed cautiously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** All right.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** And pull that laser rifle.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** I don't sense anything on the other side.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** So we should... This goes out.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Stick to the corners.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** And then, uh, so Bernice is like, you know, spinning around.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** You know how she, uh, I sent that video.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:30]** Maybe we'll post it, uh, somewhere on social media, a GIF of like one of those automated luggage briefcases.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** Yeah.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Amazing.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:39]** You should sit on Bernice and just ride around.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Amazing.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Amazing.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** No, uh, I'm not that.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** Well,

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** No, I think I'm too big.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** I'm small, but I'm not briefcase writing size.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** I don't know how tall Dr. O'Keefe is.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** I don't think you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** I think you can ride Bernice around.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** I don't think that's how that works.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Did you say you're 5'8"?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Is that right?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** No, no, like 4'8".

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Oh, okay, okay.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Small child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Bernice is tiny, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Yeah.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Bernice is like a foot by foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** What?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Really?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** That's not that big.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Yeah, it's a small briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** But it's not microscopic.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** Like microscopic briefcases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Yeah, not nanobots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** There are nanobots, though.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:33]** I imagine that Bernice's skin has that sort of nanopolymer to it that allows Bernice to sort of blend in.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** That's part of her stealth unit.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Got it.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** I love it.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** There's some nanotech in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** But only when she's closed.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:44]** So she has to be closed and calm and then her body goes chameleon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** There's also the ambulatory sort of nanobot function.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** But anyway.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:52]** Can she become the shape of a tree or something?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Or does she just become invisible and blend in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** I would say she could deform her luggage size.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:02]** But not enough to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** So you can just become a bigger briefcase or a smaller briefcase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:11]** Yeah, no, it has to be the same, like, mass, but it could be changes in proportions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Good to know.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Yeah.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** I like it, though.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** So you come out in the hall.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** Again, the lights are flickering even more now.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:27]** There's a large crack that's running down in front of you perpendicular to the length of the long hallway you're thinking about going down.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** There's a long crack that runs through maybe just an inch or two.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** Seems like really started something bucked, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** You can maybe look through a little bit.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:40]** The core, I'm going to just say like looking at this crack, that crack.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** core shutdown be causing this?

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Stress on the fuselage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** It seems like it could be from that.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** I would say maybe do an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Here's an assist with that.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** Or a physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Yeah, I'll assist for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Assisting.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** I assisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** I do not assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:03]** So that's for... Let's see.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** 16 plus 11 plus an assist.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** So 13 plus 16.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** That is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:34]** 29 nice 29 yeah i mean you are pretty well aware that while there might be the reactor itself could be slightly unstable in that like it could be sending out vibrations but this probably also came from originally well i i think you guys know why this place is also starting to shake and everything too is because of the stewardship right and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Yeah, the stewards are bombarding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:40]** Yeah, so it seems also like the steward bombardment started that.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Maybe the reactors are part of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Maybe?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** No clear indication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:51]** Yeah, but some confluence, some amalgamation of all that damage is starting this place to slowly come apart.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:58]** And what's interesting is that as you look down, I'm just going to assume that maybe curiosity gets the best of you.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** You peek over.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** You turn on the flashlight on your comms device.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** You look down in the crack.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:21]** can't say too much but you remember when in the first place that you woke up where your escape pods came into you look out you see rock maybe a few feet below in the in the in the crack that's weird okay so we're right above there

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:27]** Also down the hall, Southview, is still Nico's body.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** As a reminder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:31]** We don't have time for proper rights.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Are we leaving it here?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** I suppose we have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** He would do the same for us.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Yes.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** If he needed to, you know?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:53]** All right, so Rick is going to approach that long hallway very cautiously with his laser rifle out, his artillery laser, and turn that corner.

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:00]** And if he doesn't see anything, he's going to start moving cautiously down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:07]** Here's perceived down the hall, just in case for a 12 perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** Rick, you said, sorry, you were doing a perception check too or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Do you want me to do?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I don't want to do a million perception checks.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** That's fine.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Just tell me what you want me to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** I don't think that you need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** Because otherwise I'm going to go five feet, perception check, five feet, perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, don't do that.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** I would tell you I know it was just one of them.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** So Rick starts to head down the hall.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** You don't notice anything.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** The hall itself seems pretty long.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** Like I said, there seems to be some swirling light or structure at the other end of the hall.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:40]** It's casting light onto the ground that is constantly changing color in a pretty periodic fashion.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:47]** And otherwise, nothing else about the hall seems to be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:47 - 00:42:10]** of any import that device that you're talking about that's that multi-colored thing that we can see right now right that i was mentioning earlier yeah that you the players can see but like you can just see part of it so dr okay though i think maybe dr okay and rick actually rick and dr okay give me a perception check i rolled 11 okay dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:15]** Uh, 16 on the die, plus 12.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** So, 28.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** Baller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:26]** Rick, to you, it just manifests as you're walking by and your vision for a second.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:33]** Just like... They're just little artifacts in your vision.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** It's a little stutter.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Dr.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:39]** O.K., maybe you...

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:49]** I think you notice it on your, I'm blanking on the term, your lab, your micro lab.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:52]** The Twitch notification.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Not a notification.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** I don't know.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** I'm going to message you, Will, privately.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Okay, I sent you a message in Slack, Will.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Just message me back.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** You can take your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Okay, this is like a physics question.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** That's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** What is going on between you two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:32]** I mean, I do want to ask the paralegals, but I just feel like it doesn't make sense to say nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Jeff said he was always on and waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** That's true.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** It's true.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Thank you, Jeff.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Release the Jeff signal.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Release the Jeff signal.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** Shine the Jeff signal into the air.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** Kevin's just waiting there like Inspector Gordon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:51 - 00:44:00]** If the answer to my question is true, then I might get a plus four circumstance bonus.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Good to know.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** To this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:07]** What's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:12]** I just tickled Kev's ears like, what rules are being broken?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** It was a slug thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** All because of a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** My first thing to Jeff was, hey, we're recording right now.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Got a question.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Thumbs up.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** Within like two seconds.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:32]** Sorry, chemilizer is the term that we were... Okay.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Not getting anything right now.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:40]** I want to get this right, so I don't want to... If he doesn't respond, I'm just going to make a call.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** I think you would.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** That's what I think, too.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:53]** But the problem is that, as I said, from everything else that I've seen in AP slash in the book, it's like, yes, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:53 - 00:45:00]** There's no... What kills me about it is it says, or other chemical substance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Right, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** It's like, I don't know.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** It is a chemical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** It is a substance.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:17]** I did technically get, you know, I think it would, too, from my physics knowledge from USC.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I think it would have been well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:21]** From the esteemed college that brought you.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** From the, yeah.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** University of Southern Castroville.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** The University of Southern Castroville.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** The football scandal.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** Yeah.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** The admissions scandal.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** Yeah, it's not great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** There's no engineering scandals.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** Even now, Will is like, yeah, I got to take a dig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Yeah, there's no Viterbi scandal.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** Because I'll get a dig into somehow even what this is called.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** No Viterbi scandal yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Yet.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Okay.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Okay, interesting.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** What's the verdict?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** It's just what we thought, which is what I said.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** That like, you know, raw, it's like, yes, no.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So probably like explicitly no.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** But...

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** he's saying the same thing that we are, which is like, you could interpret it as that.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:07]** Cause it's like, yes, that's, that's what you would use anyway to detect it in our world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** It's also like, yeah, it's the same apparatus.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Even it's got a wand.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Exactly.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Like sampling.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Yeah.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Kev will be mad, but it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** I'm not even sure what I'd be mad about.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** It's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** We'll something's going on or Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** We're, we're, we're, we're back now.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** As you start to turn the corner,

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:47]** your chemilyzer starts pinging and it seems like there's something going on that you can only attribute to like heightened levels of radiation, but it's not too frequent.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** And as you get closer to the hallway, it gets a little more.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** It's not dangerous.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** Technically, radiation in Starfinder has mechanical levels of low, medium, high.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** You're not really necessarily too far.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** It just seems like it's not like this area is flooded with it.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** It just seems like as you step closer to the hallway, you just get pains of it more and more.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** They're not periodic.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** You're not quite sure what they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Or why?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:24]** Well, I could start doing some sort of sample of the energy level, wouldn't I?

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Sure, yeah.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:30]** So would I be able to determine if it's coming from the said reactor that we need to shut down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** I don't know that you could determine that.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:37]** If anything, though, because you think, eh, it said it's on a lower level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** Could it be coming from a man-made power source?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** Yes, or definitely something man-made.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Constructed.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:59]** On Roll20, you're not moving down the hallway, but for purposes of narrative, as you get closer to this door that's in the middle of the hallway, the pings start becoming a little more frequent.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** Again, not periodic, just random, but they start happening.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** This door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:08]** There's some radiation, but...

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:15]** It doesn't seem like it's a reactor type where it would be very... I feel like for a reactor, it would be more identifiable.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** Don't think of this because you are a nuclear tech, Kif.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:27]** Well, I'm just... If we didn't have this time constraint of shutting down the reactors and getting the hell out of this place, I would want to explore every single room in this building.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** It's a very interesting place.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** But Rick hears what you're saying.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** He sees the door.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:35]** He's going to step away from the door.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** Can I do a perception check to see if there's any kind of label?

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** Sure.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** That's a 16 plus 6, I believe, or 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** It's not like the other labs where they had the holographic creature.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** There's none of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** There's nothing.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** It's just a door.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** It's just a door.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Rick's going to move past it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:58]** Here's just sees Rick's interesting behavior and is like, is something going on?

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** He doesn't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** I say we book it.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Why?

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** What happened?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** There's radiation coming from this doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Let's not deal with anything with radiation.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** Wait, isn't that where the reactors are then?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Isn't that where we have to shut down?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Not necessarily.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** All right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:18]** Okay, so we should run away from the radiation if we're trying to shut down reactors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:24]** I think we should continue and try to find a stairway instead of entering into random rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** All right, all right.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** I forgot that that's downstairs.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Okay.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:31]** So you continue walking down the hallway.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** Why isn't Bernice going to cover our flank?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** You start walking down the hallway.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:48]** As you get closer, again, you can just tell that the colors from that object seem to be...

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:50]** Periodic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Hmm.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** The subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Yeah.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Here's is a computer specialist.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:55]** Yeah.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** He's going to roll to is 31 to see what it is.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** What kind of computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:07]** It, it doesn't seem like it is a computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Okay.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:12]** Engineering for a 12 somehow, even though I have really high engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Yeah.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:18]** As you get closer, you can start to make out that these, it just seems like a box that

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** that it's projecting these colors that are soothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Jeez.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** That's not good.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** That's all you get.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Don't look at it, I guess.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Is there another check that I could use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:46]** I say we try not to disturb anything and perhaps we can just scoot by and maybe we won't run into any jack-in-the-boxes.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Just observe it.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** My recommendation is to observe it and try not to disturb anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Don't look at it, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** As you... The Medusa of computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** It literally doesn't seem like a computer.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** It doesn't seem like anything mechanical.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** It seems very weird.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** You're not quite sure why it's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** God, this is a monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Life science?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** You can roll either one of those.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** But I'll tell you, as you get closer, then I'm going to reveal something.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:25]** Because as you get closer, you can see up in front of you is an alcove.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:54]** these things yeah because as you step closer they start the two that are in front of you maybe 20 feet colors start to appear and swirl around those and they illuminate a couple things no they illuminate a couple things maybe I rolled a 13 on mysticism 20 on life science they don't seem to be alive and they don't seem to have any magic they literally just seem like they're like motion sensors yeah

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:12]** and what's interesting is that either well not not necessarily motion sensors but they clearly use one to to come on there are white egg-like pods in this 20 foot deep alcove that's ahead of you the pods are

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:18]** also inside have these swirling colors, but smaller.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** It's like a smaller little light.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:29]** And it seems like that to your right, down south, there seems to be a little arch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Just say a ladder well, and let us get the hell out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:43]** No, there seems to be an arch, but it seems to be burned and blackened on the arch itself, but the platform is unmarked.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** I'm going to show you a picture of what the egg pods ahead of you.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:52]** So that arch, by the way, with the burned and blackened pod is down here.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** These egg-like pods are up here.

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:02]** And what I want you to do is while I show you this picture, I want somebody to give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:27]** okay this is what it looks like kind of in front of you i got pretty good on that wow it looks cool i mean they look like the eggs from alien except for there's like 28 the the dna character from jurassic park floating around inside of it yeah yeah that's accurate there were like lots of little colorful like elemental structures or something


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:34]** Like the pods from the end of, not to spoil X-Files, the movie, but what Mulder was in.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** As you walk up.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** I got a 20 for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** 20 for culture.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** But nicer.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** But nicer.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Colorful.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Pretty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** They're really colorful.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Okay.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:49]** It's like a bunch of Gushers.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Looks like that inside.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** I only rolled an 11 on culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** I got a 28 culture check on it.

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:12]** And Bernice is up ahead of me, sort of scanning the hallways, but also trying to clear the hallway and trying to also investigate roughly these creatures, or these items.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** No, no, that makes a lot of sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** With the plasma...

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** vapor cavitation pistol out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Yeah.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Okay.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** So, you realize a couple things.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** Bernice looks up and sees that this hallway is pretty long.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** It's maybe another...

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** 20, probably another 60 feet down to the south, down here.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Let me ping it.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** It's a long hallway.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Again, the floor is cracked.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:43]** The ceiling is... The light is dim now, a little brighter, probably normal because of these, like, circling things, lights.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** And to the north, it seems like it extends probably, gosh, another 100 feet.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** And there seem to be two more alcoves to the north and one more to the south.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:57]** Rick, you notice that these coloring lights...

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:24]** are shapes because as you get closer your focus comes in and they're boxes they seem to be little boxes it's unclear they're big ones that are floating in the hall and then little ones that are in these little pots and dr k you put it together you realize grace grace probably need a place to sleep this is probably like a communal area where grace can sleep or store things

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:32]** It seems like it's the quarters for people who research here, the greys who research here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** So is there any sign of greys currently?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Like they look empty or full?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** They look empty.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** They look like they can fit a small creature and they look empty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** I bet these things have like regenerative abilities.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:47]** We could have just not rested.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Just sat down on one of these for five minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** You would totally go in an alien machine in the hallway of this place.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** I don't know.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** It doesn't sound like something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:00]** So Rick moves forward towards the hallway, and then I'm going to roll a perception.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** I'm going to reveal it.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** Natural 20 on a perception for nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** 32.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** Natural 20, 32.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Okay.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:17]** I'm going to reveal the one down to the south first.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** You're able to kind of see down through it.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** Seems like there's some more pods, some more lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:30]** Is this light blue thing just in the hallway, is that the archway you were talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Yeah, the arch is scorched.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** Looks like it's ceramic, or it used to be.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** It's light blue.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:44]** I'll reveal to the hallway what you see, but since the hallway is so long, you can't really see into any alcove.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Although Bernice said there are two more up here.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Bernice relayed.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:54]** But at the very far end, you do see a giant...

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:58]** And by giant, I mean the size of the doors into some of the other places that you've seen.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:02]** But it looks very heavy airlock door.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** And there's more of those archways?

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:07]** Yeah, there are two more alcoves and there are two more of these archways.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** They also seem to be blackened on the top.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Whereas these ones aren't?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** No, those also are.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** All three that you can see in the hallway, those arches are blackened.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Are they teleporters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:23]** Can we do some kind of check on that to see what the hell these things are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Give me a mysticism or engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** 18 on engineering.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** 16 on mysticism, if you want to take that.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Yeah.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Which one do you do, Kev?

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** I'll do mysticism.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** I'll do 16 on mysticism.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:45]** I rolled a 25 on engineering.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** So plus two.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** So 18.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** Oh, you were, were you assisting Will or were you doing your own check?

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** No, I'll just do engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Okay.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** What do I need to roll to assist?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** How high do you want to be again?

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** If you want.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** No, but how high is it?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Oh, okay.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Okay, cool.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** I assist Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:24]** okay so 18 mysticism 25 engineering yeah these seem like they could be like they're tall enough for small creatures the archway might at some point it's ceramic so it's probably not extendable so it seems kind of odd but looking at just a glance and what you know

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:30]** They do seem like something that can transport or portal.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** Yeah, it's the Flu Network creatures.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** Yeah, from Harry Potter.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:41]** But they seem now that they're completely dysfunctional.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Oh, they no longer work?

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:50]** No, that's why the arch is totally... Seems like it was probably some sort of thing that's designed to do that.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** Rick, as you step forward...

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:59]** You see, again, this alcove, the second one to the north.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:08]** Again, two more pods and more of these floating boxes.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** You think now you're like, these probably store...

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** Maybe they put things here if they had things.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** I haven't seen a gray having a pocket.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:24]** So maybe there's some sort of storage and this is where they sleep and then they can use these things.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** It seems very odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:31]** And Rick's going to walk up to this one closest to him and just take a closer look at it.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** Is there anything... Is there a way to open it?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Is there something in it?

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Or is it just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:44]** The boxes are just floating, slowly moving in a spiral, occasionally turning in a different axis.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:48]** Seems like you just put them in there and they just start to float.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:53]** Oh, so if you like took one, if it's like a floating shelf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Yeah, it's like storage.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** Exactly.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** It's a shelf.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** So Rick will reach forward and grab one of the boxes then.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** It's a mimic.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** I was just in theme, the theme of everything.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** I was just thinking it's a mimic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:17]** How cool would it be to have a storage apparatus that maintained a vortex of floating packages and things?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:21]** Like, oh, I'm just going to throw my pen into this vortex and I'll just grab it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:25]** I was thinking like put it on your front porch and like freak out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Someday in the future, guys.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:30]** It's going to be great.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** We're going to be in the future one day, yeah.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** So you reach in.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** You pull out a box.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** It's purple.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** You're holding it in your hand.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** Maybe it's four inches by four inches by four inches.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** It's a little square.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** The vortex doesn't change.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** The physics of it doesn't change.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** You just pull it out of the stream and you're holding this box.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** It feels lightweight.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** Candy.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** But overall, it seems like it's just a box.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** It sounds like there might be something in it that has a little weight to it.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:12]** The material is lightweight, but it seems like there could be something inside.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Is there a way to open it?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** Yeah, there seems to be a top and there's like a lip.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** Yeah, what kind of packaging?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]** It's a piece of lightweight metal that's purple.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:27]** Sorry, it's not purple once you pull it out.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]** Once you pull it out, it just assumes kind of a gray color.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Once you put it in, it adopts a color.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** Rick's going to open the box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** What's in the box?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** What's in the box?

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** What's in the box?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** You open the box.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:47]** It opens soundlessly.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Couple things.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** Oh boy, look.

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:12]** The first thing that is odd is that there seems to be like, the biggest thing is this piece of wood and it looks like a spindle and it has seven flat sides with all these markings on it.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** It's a dreidel?

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:19]** It's kind of a dreidel, but it has more sides to it

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:32]** And Rick, for some reason, you just you instantly know that the figures on it are the Yosuke numbers one through seven.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:36]** And you're like, I don't I guess weird.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:43]** You know that this is a this is a randomizer for gambling for a board game or a gambling game.

**[01:02:45 - 01:03:09]** unsettling though that you recognize it you feel like there's a there's a memory attached to it it's just just out of reach but then the other weird thing there seems to be some sort of knickknack and then there's a there's another knickknack and then there's another they're weird tokens of us

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:15]** I can't say that they're necessarily talking to you, but they do seem to be personal belongings.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** An earring.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:21]** And then... And then a ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** A tail ring.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:27]** Are these all Yasuki-related, or they just seem...

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:33]** Okay, here's my theory on it, is the greys are just creepy assholes that steal stuff from people.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** And this is where they put it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:50]** They seem like they are objects that if you trace their origin or look at their feeling, it feels like they could be from all over the packed worlds and near space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:56]** It's like that idea that you lose something right in your house, it just goes missing and you never see it again.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:00]** It's that, but the idea is that the greys are the ones that are taking it from you.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Wow.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** They infiltrate your house and they snatch something small and stupid.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** Very creepy.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** And they take them and they just put them in these boxes that float.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Are all the boxes roughly the same size and dimension?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:17]** They do seem to be roughly the same size and dimension.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:19]** And it seems like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Is that tail ring Grath's tail ring?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** Just by a random chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:26]** No.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** I think he found Grath's tail ring in the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** But they didn't take it later?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** No.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** After his supposed death?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:37]** I mean, that doesn't look like it's Grath's tail ring.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** Got it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:38]** Tail ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** All right, got it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:43]** Rick's going to grab a second box and open it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:49]** As you grab a second box, you open it up.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** There's one thing.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:58]** It's a small metal disc, maybe about half an inch or an inch and a half in diameter.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** Maybe about half an inch thick.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** It's metal.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** It's curved.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:09]** So it's like a toroid, except there's no hole in the middle.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:13]** So it's like has a curved outside and then a flat edge on the top and the bottom.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:14]** Smooth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Like a coin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:16]** Yeah, but thick.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** Okay.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Like a pog slammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Yeah.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** Pog slammer.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** There's no castravelian pog slammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** That's what it is, yeah.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** Are there any markings on it or anything?

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:31]** No, there's nothing.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Can I sense anything from it?

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** It's just a piece of metal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:37]** Yeah, maybe there's a weird little pull in the back of your mind.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]** There's something that's like, you should just grab it.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** I should what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** Just take this.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Take this.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Take this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:44 - 01:06:07]** not in a bad way just like there's like an invitation in the back of your head can i do mysticism on it just it's just a hunch dude it's just a feeling not a mysticism well i rolled a mysticism 19 mystic hunch it's just a metal object you have a hunch about yeah that's it wow nope what do you got there rick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:20]** And he's just going to hold both boxes open towards you and be like, I have no idea what these look like personal items, and this one's telling me to touch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** Maybe they're test subjects as things.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:24]** It's not telling you to touch it.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:26]** It's just like in the back of your head, you're like, I want to touch it.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** I'm not going to make you roll anything for it.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** It's just a little thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:29]** Nope.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** Not touching it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** Mm-mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:40]** Should we keep going through these boxes or are we going to... Do we think there's anything of value in them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** From what I've seen, no.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** I'd say we move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** I quite agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:48]** But I'm torn because I just want to go through everything.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** I understand.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:59]** Only because I know Kev's like, man, we need to really go through all these boxes and see how many... I would go through every last box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** If you want to take the time to go through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** How much time would it take?

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]** You can just quickly start to open boxes here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** Kevin would.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Rick does not.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** Rick's moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:18]** It won't take you long to... There aren't so many boxes.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** It won't take you long if you want to go through it.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:22]** If you don't, that's fine, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** The rogue in me wants to.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Dr. K would be curious.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:29]** I'm always curious to see what's in these boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:33]** Lord and I are re-watching Iron Fist.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:38]** In one of the episodes, there's a whole thing about junk patents.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** And...

**[01:07:40 - 01:08:06]** it's a brother and sister like business person and they're like oh she's leaving the company and she's taking all the junk patents and somebody makes a comment like you know junk the key word there is junk like the junk patents and the brother is like no there's one of these patents is not junk and that's how i feel that's what you're doing to us right now like these are just boxes full of junk except one of them has an ability crystal or something in it like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:30]** all right i mean if you want to look i can tell you the things that seem the most significant let's do it okay yeah i think okay here's walks up so one of these and he's right do you look in just this alcove or do you look in the uh i say we take the time looking the ones that we can see okay so all them except the top one right yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** You take a second.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** You walk through.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:37]** Again, it seems like more curious objects.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:41]** Seems to be other personal effects.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Maybe a piece of cloth.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Something weird.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:48]** There does seem to be two other things.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:53]** You find one in the alcove that you found this disc.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:59]** That was the only item of super big note other than the spindle.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:06]** In the one directly to the south, you find this coil of, like, silk string.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:12]** It seems like it's thick as, you know, a single human hair.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:19]** But you estimate, gosh, this thing's 40 to 50 feet long, wrapped up.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:23]** And when you hold it, it seems very soft.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:28]** But if you do an engineering check...

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:36]** you realize that this thing has some properties to where it's probably immune to a couple different types of damage.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:41]** It seems like it has a pretty good, you know, substantial.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** Yeah, even though it's so thin.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Some sort of microchord.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Yeah, microchord.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:47]** Yeah, some sort of microchord.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:53]** And then in the one to the far south, you see this hinged clip.

**[01:09:56 - 01:10:03]** Like one of the big paper clips that you, you know, the binder clips, right?

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:11]** And on the side of one of the edges that you would clip onto something, it says the olfactory nose.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** The olfactory or the old factory?

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** The olfactory nose.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** A smell then.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:43]** and it seems like a clip and there's it seems like it's been put on noses like that like it's like shaped a little bit as as if it's like you put it on and no it's it's it's clearly designed to do something it seems like you're supposed to put it on your nose and then something happens but it's just called the olfactory nose let's take it can we try it sure who wants to try it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:44 - 01:11:08]** bernice doesn't have a nose but could she use it you could clip it on bernice nothing happens you don't pick up any anything from bernice i guess dr okay i'll try it does it seem innocuous enough like i could take it off yeah it seems like it yeah okay okay so you take it tentacle

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:16]** Put it on my tentacle orifice of where my olfactory... Senses are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** Yeah.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:25]** It seems like when you put it on, the shape almost kind of conforms to whatever the opening is where you would sense.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:27]** Okay.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:37]** And when you do, your nose is immediately filled almost instantaneously.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:37]** Okay.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:44]** And you get this impression that settles over you.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:46]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:50]** You're not dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:52]** I don't even know what to make of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** Well, it was nice.

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]** A nice change of pace not to have a battle for once.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** That was cool.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** Very interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:02]** Until the beginning of the next episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** When Dr. AK transforms into a zombie or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** Shoot you in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** Rick is so risk averse.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:09]** You would be too after all of this.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** I agree.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** I totally agree.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:16]** We're just shuddering around like every single corner at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Hey there, this is John Swan.
