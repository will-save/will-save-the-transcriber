**[00:00:00 - 00:00:18]** Previously on WillSave From the faint ping of a communications console came the call of a steward special ops team investigating the illegal activity our subjects have been subjected to and inform our heroes of the grave situation the greys have placed them in.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:33]** Our crew learns of Shay, another Steward Ops special agent aboard this facility, and the threat of the imminent explosion about to emanate from the Grey's reactors if our heroes are unable to act in time.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:49]** With the stewards now in communication to guide our crew's new mission, Rick stepped out into the hallway to encounter another set of green orbs and a pair of ravenous laser-wielding wolves, a couple of Tash Tari, who proceeded to wreak havoc against our heroes.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:53]** Will our party be able to tame these troubles ahead?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:56]** Or are these the dogs to number our heroes' days?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** I just don't want to get a big head about it.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I'm not getting a big head.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:26]** I'm just the number 7,000 and the fact that it's our voices.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** I don't know.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** Kelly, you vocalize first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I need to stop saying things because I always end up...

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** I make one utterance and they're like, Kelly's ready with an answer.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** That's a really good question.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** So much that we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Someone else go.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, Gen Con was a lot of fun.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** I don't know how related that is to the podcast itself.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** We talked about recording in person in Gen Con and we never got around to that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** I was thinking of two.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Well, that's it.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Gen Con's good.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** I guess my favorite... Well, no, not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** I think Jon was implying in-game, though, right?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** I should mention... In-game, out-of-game, minus the voice crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:05]** I guess I'll choose one thing from Gen Con where Kevin wanted to light... We were playing this game called Munchkins.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** It was like Starfinder.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** Starfinder Munchkins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Starfinder Munchkins.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Starfinder Munchkins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Thank you, Steve Jackson.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** And Kevin wanted to light all of them on fire by the end of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** He was so angry.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** Yeah.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** And John kept f***ing with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** Dude, because Kev made one Machiavellian move out of the gate.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** And we all were like, all right, that guy Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** I'm just trying to show you how the game works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** It was also like the second night.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:32]** So, you know, it's been a fun time.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** It's been a great game.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It's a great game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** It's not at 2 a.m.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** It's like, I hate this game.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:42 - 00:08:08]** going to bed i hate a lot of games it was actually a fun game okay i guess like game wise my favorite thing was the last episode probably of book one that was like really really interesting seeing like a bunch of npcs drop dead and being confused and stuff and us having to survive and get off of this exploding whatever the hell it was was really cool i like that episode a lot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** I got to kind of concur with that.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:24]** I think that that final episode of book one was, was just like eyeopening and like really sealed, like some of the situation going on and just changed your perspective on things and blew our minds.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** And John did such a good job.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Hey, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** It was great.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** Also, thanks to the wonderful writer of book one.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** And I'll insert their name in.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Here.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** Thank you, Paizo.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** Any other fun times?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** I don't even have book one because that's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** That's John's book.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** He's the only one that has it.

**[00:08:46 - 00:09:07]** those uh i think yeah in in game i think that last that last episode was huge i i think that really just it changed a lot of what was going on for us and that's a big big turning point in game uh out of game i think it would be really punishable if i didn't say that my favorite thing that happened in the last year was my son


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** Hey.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** Yes.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:19]** The listeners don't really know this, but we recorded one episode on Saturday in September of 2019, technically.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** 2020.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** 2020.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** Yeah.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Sorry.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** I know.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** My years are all screwed.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** Yep.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** 2020.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** And then my son actually was born...

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** on that following Monday, six weeks early.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** It was a big surprise for all of us.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:38]** And watching him grow over the last year has been phenomenal.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** He's a little will saver.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** He's part of the willing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Yes, he is.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** That's right.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** He's a founding member.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Absolutely.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Baby Grayson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Legacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:56]** Literally, we end the episode, and then Kev talks in our Slack at us, like, hey, by the way, we're going to the hospital, like, hours later, you know, after the first episode.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** Great.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:58]** Yeah.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Great times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:04]** And now Grayson's running around with his giant Kraken die.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** Nice.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** And he picks it up and drops it and picks it up and drops it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:12]** I don't think he understands the concept of a math rock yet, but he likes the idea of dropping it, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:17]** That's because he is just a born TTRPG-er.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** That's right.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** In his blood.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** In his blood.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:25]** I think my favorite in-game moment was definitely, I mean, yeah, the end of book one for sure.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Also just the start, like the first episode for us.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:42]** We just had so much work and effort put into these awesome narratives that you guys came up with for your characters and just walking through that, working on them with you and just the energy of book one.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Yeah.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** And having everything prepped.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:50]** And it's like we finally begin because we had we were going to record in person literally in like March of 2020.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** And then we're like, oh, we'll wait a few months.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** The pandemic will be over.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Then it wasn't.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** So then we're like, all right, we got to pivot to recording remotely.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** Then we had to sync up schedules like all this work.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:05]** It was about a year of just effort and coordination in the making.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** And then we finally hit record.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** And I remember being so nervous, being in the same spot I am now, looking at your faces on the screen.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** And just, yeah, we've come a long way.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** It's been awesome.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** It has been.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Yeah, I totally agree with that.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:26]** That episode is still so deep because we're still exploring those backgrounds and what happened in that 24-hour, 24-hour, 24-hour, 24-hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:37]** I really liked the setup that when we do record in person from time to time, Will and John did an incredible job there.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** And Will's an amazing host with his giant fridge of beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** He's amazing.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** That's always the preference.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:48]** is to be in person and in Will's garage.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Will's safe studio, LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:56]** The next iteration of our studio will be quite different, but it'll be nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** I also have enjoyed Kevin's rants.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** That's another comment that I'll make over the last year.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:05]** You, as the listener, don't always get the full picture of it, but it's pretty hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** I enjoy editing Kevin's rants.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Wait till we go live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:17]** Something that did make it to the final cut was with the dinosaurs coming out of the green portals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:22]** And he's like, and then 20 more portals appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:27]** So well summarized, I think, my feelings at least about the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:34]** That's a good another in-game moment was learning that John was actually bleeping us at one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yeah.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** And we're like, let's do this.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** Thanks, John.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Let's do this.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** It's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Yeah, John, you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:46]** Well, it was like the episode before we were like joking about bleeping something out.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** But we were talking about bleeping.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:52]** If you bleep like words that aren't bad, it makes them sound bad.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:57]** And then like in the discord, people were laughing like, oh, blah, blah.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** You had a lot of bleeps that episode.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** And I was like, oh, yeah.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** And then I listened to the episode and was like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:27]** what the hell man a lot of bleeps a lot of bleeps amazing one thing that uh that also kelly great avatar uh uh video oh thanks i'm writing oppa nice yeah oh you absolutely are with and you can see socca i think i'm sorry soccer here yeah they're the best


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:38]** One moment that I really liked was being at Gen Con, deciding that, you know what, we should go to the steakhouse that Indianapolis is their claim to fame, not the Colts, right?

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** The steakhouse.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** And we're there.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** And Kelly goes to the water closet, comes back.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** He's like, guys, just so you know.

**[00:13:47 - 00:14:09]** glass cannon is sitting literally right above us like the level above us in like almost just directly above us and just walking up and we all at some point went up to the water closet walk past them saw them to spy on them to spy on them and look at their notes and try and steal ideas clearly but it was just such a crazy thing to like start the show and

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:36]** because we listened to androids and aliens and because we were like oh starfinder is really cool and we we were like we should do a podcast and that was one of the big inspirations and then to be at the same convention as them and to be a podcast and they are like under the same roof just felt like such kind of a really surreal moment we kept you know we kept joking like we need to get on their level literally because they're literally a level above us they were literally a table directly above our heads yeah yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Yeah.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** We'll make it to the ground floor someday.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** Next time, hopefully, we eat upstairs.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Exactly.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** Next time, we'll just ask for an upstairs table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Not in the basement.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Not in the basement.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** The cold basement.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** Which was nice.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** It was very nice.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Very.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** A lot of.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** My steak was not cold.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Nope.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Definitely not.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Yeah.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** That's a different story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** That's a whole other thing.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** Also, do they call it a water closet in Florida?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Is that why you say this?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Or are you just trying to be internationally friendly right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Just trying to be internationally friendly.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** WC.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Yeah.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** You know me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Good times.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** All right.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** Well, we got a few short rules updates.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:23]** Then we can get back to the game unless anybody else has anything else they want to share about the past year.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** Great.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Rules update.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:39]** First thing is that we discussed previously that when you level up, you do have an opportunity to test out skills, feats, spells, whatever it might be.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:43]** And if you don't like it, then you will have an opportunity to change it.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** And I think originally...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:45 - 00:16:09]** let it be known though yeah that it's not universal on everything well that's the debate still right so we call it the lemon law and basically it's like if you if you get a feat or a spell or something that you just it doesn't work for your character you have a certain amount of time in order to like recall it and change it out yep so what are you saying will is the limitations


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** I was just, are we including like class?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** I think that was the debate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:29]** My thought is a skill or a feat or a spell feels like the terms and conditions that we've set of one week slash episode or one combat, right?

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:33]** So it gives you a chance to use something that is either in or out of combat.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:36]** But that was before anybody was multiclass.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** And now that we have... Will, are you talking about changing your multiclass?

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Okay.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:45]** So it's not being invoked right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** But for future, right?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** I want it to be established.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:54]** And I don't want this to be mistaken as precedent for some other... Totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:58]** I think we got to take it to the Supreme Court and ask Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** We definitely need to.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:21]** My thought is that when you take a new class, a new level, either in the same class or a new class, that requires, I think, one level worth of stuff, content, like in combat, out of combat, using those skills to figure it out.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:36]** Then if you really like and I kind of think it should be like if you take the same level in the same class, I don't really think you should have an opportunity to like we to, you know, read multiclass after.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Exactly.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:43]** But if you take your first level in a multiclass and you say, you know what, this class is really not for me.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I don't know that.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Okay.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Then – I see a case.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Yeah.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** But my thought is that – It hasn't happened.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** There's no precedent for it.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** There's no case law.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** But my – Could be egregious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:58]** You're saying you're ruling for allowance to change a multiclass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:06]** In a specific situation that the first level that you take in a multiclass, if you're like, wow, I really thought this was going to be great, but it's not –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:11]** Yeah, if I suddenly was like, I took operative next class, I'm like, no, I should have actually been.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** I think it's hard for mechanic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:24]** As a mechanic, if you take a first level mechanic, you immediately have to choose if you're going to have the exoskeleton or whatever it's called, or a drone.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** There's like three options, right, for mechanic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Well, there's more than three.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Oh, but yeah, there's multiple.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Yeah.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** There's a drone, there's the cortex, there's a lot of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:41]** Yeah, so there's a lot there, and yeah, you can really get into something dirty, for whatever term.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** You know how bad I am with words.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** Yeah, if you just go down the wrong route, you make a mistake.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:59]** The limit that we did have, though, was you have one week or one full combat to decide whether or not those...

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** whatever you want to change and go back on.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** So we are calling it the Lemon Law and it does apply.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:08]** Has anybody utilized Lemon Law recently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** No one.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** I'm going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Oh, invoking the Lemon Law!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Yeah.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:17]** I'm taking this back to the dealership because inject nanobots does not work for me.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Like, I... Tears is not a character built for this.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:27]** I also misunderstood that I had to make a melee roll, which makes sense now in retrospect, but...

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Not going to do this.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** So getting rid of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** So it's not that the spell is bad.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:36]** It's that the spell and here's don't align.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Right.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** Exactly.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** I don't have a high enough.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** I think Dex is what it is.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Here's is not very dexterous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Because it is a really cool spell.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** It's an awesome spell.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:51]** Maybe this will help with future character design, right?

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:54]** And that will be something that you're kind of considering more.

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:00]** Because the one small text I want to add is that I think retroactively...

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** For multi-class, I think we should maybe make it work story-wise.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:11]** I think if there's a way to make it work story-wise that you just stopped using inject nanobots and you got another spell, I think that would be great.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** But I don't think it's super necessary.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** But I think it would be helpful to give some context.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:19]** So it's not just completely a game thing.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** But if you're like, I really can't make it work, but I still want to change it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:27]** Basically, lore-wise here is just like, you know, he knows it doesn't work.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** He learned it.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** He's just not going to use it anymore.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:35]** And he's just going to peruse his other spell books and pick something out that's more useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Yeah, makes sense.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, I'm for it.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:41]** If you have any objections, please let us know on Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:47]** Write to us at WeDon'tCare at We'llSayThePodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:53]** I'll give you a thumbs up and then I'll forget about it.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** There is a good channel in Discord.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:02]** You could add it to the ideas and feedback text channel in our Discord.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** Yes.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Give us your feedback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** There's also the rules and mistake channel is also a viable place for that.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Yeah.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** And we definitely don't just forget all those things.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** We have a list now compiled of all the rules that we need to remember every week.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** It's getting pretty long.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Yeah.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** There's a lot of rules to start finding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** A lot of rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Rules Paralegals, you've helped out the firm very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** And Kevin, our rules lawyer, is better prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:30]** Maybe we should discuss some end-of-year bonuses for our Rules Paralegals sign.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Figure it out.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Or just for the community.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** I don't think we can afford bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** We're not quite there yet.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** Maybe bonuses we would like to give the community.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** We'll give you phantom shares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** They're not voting shares, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** All right, should we play?

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Look it up.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Yeah.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Look it up.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Look it up.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** Let's play right under the deadline.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** That needs to be a drop.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Yeah.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Yeah, that's going to be a drop.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** That's absolutely going to be a drop.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Look it up.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** It goes well with the we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** That needs to be a Patreon goal.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Kelly, shout out to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:19]** Kelly, the nicest guy on the podcast will yell at you for a Patreon goal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** Send you a recording yelling at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** I don't think I've ever seen Kelly mad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Yeah, no, you haven't.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** No.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:32]** All right, so let's take a minute to get into the... Just slide him right in, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:36]** We've had in-person conversations where you've seen this, but not on the podcast.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** All right, so let's take a minute.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** Take all this episode 52 energy.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Sink it into the story.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** Because after what feels like days...

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:57]** of braving and surviving the horrors of this place.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:07]** You have finally, whether by luck, design, or fate, come upon a possible way to escape.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:21]** So you have found your way somehow into the communications between two Steward Special Ops agents, Narla Yalamis and Shay Daisha.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:33]** And they tell you that they are at this location on Seward's business and that you and Shay's team are trapped inside.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** As you can't leave, the doors are locked.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:47]** The nuclear reactors are on a sanitation procedure and could blow in as little as a few hours.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:51]** Shay's team will shut down one reactor.

**[00:23:52 - 00:24:02]** You are to find and shut down the second reactor or somehow disable this sanitation procedure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Hit the scram button.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Boop, boop.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Is that a little navy thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** It's usually actually a switch.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** It's a scram switch.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** That's how you shut down a reactor.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** I don't know what the sanitation process is, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** You'll find out.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:25]** As you are leaving after this set of communications, there are two more green portals that appear.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:30]** And the last time this happened, one of your party members was killed.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:35]** And very nearly a second, possibly all of you.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:45]** But this time, two luminescent wolf-like creatures step out, snapping and snarling.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** and they attack.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:59]** One emits this harsh flash of light, while the other unleashes this massive beam of radiant energy, like a kamehameha, from its jaws, hitting Gears.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:05]** And that is the loading landing page on our Roll20 for this session.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:28]** rick braves the fearsome beast of light and you swing with all the might that your sro android body can summon before i tell you what happens just want to say thank you to sirenscape and paizo and hero lab and most importantly oh and also uh who else


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** Well... Roll 20?

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Roll 20, yeah.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** And also... Roll 20's kind of a big one.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:35]** Yeah.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:41]** The provider of the wolf assets and the street fighter energy beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** For Roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** For Roll 20, yeah.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** And also thank you to our listeners yet again.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:52]** And I mostly just want to make Rick or Kevin get nervous.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Because Rick, you went to swing.

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:00]** Your axe soars through the air, coming towards the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:08]** If you say that these things get like some super counterattack, I'm... That's really funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** KAC of 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** An automatic hit for counters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** So you... Yep.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** swung with a 15 to hit.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** And here's the thing.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:27]** Your axe begins to hit the creature, but it moves slightly at the last second.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:39]** And so you hit only superficially as the axe chops some diamond bristles off as they fall to the floor.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** Your hit was so close that

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** But you missed.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** You were very close to hitting them.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** But you missed.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** That's kind of comforting, actually.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Do we see the map yet?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** No, because I haven't moved you over yet.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** I was waiting for that to live in the theater of Kev's mind.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** And now you should be able to.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:04]** Sorry for interrupting.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** No, no.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** You didn't interrupt.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** It's cool.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** I always like it when you guys ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** This is kind of comforting, though.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** I think he's telling us...

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** is that these things have an AC of 16.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** A KAC of 16, yeah.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** That's not that bad.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** I'm going to just step back and use my laser and hit them every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** So I think that was your turn, though, right?

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** Fend off these dogs.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:30]** But we don't know what kind of fiendishly modifiedness they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Yeah, Rick failed at a life science check last time.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** But I don't know any of this.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:37]** Although, I believe, Rick19, that was your entire turn, right?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** You moved and you swung.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** You switched weapons and you swung.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** It was a whole week ago.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** That was your turn.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** We decided I'm in here, right?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** This is closed?

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** I think it was open, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** The door's open and yeah.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:59]** I think Rick actually shouted, like, get back inside there because we could just get in there and shut those doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Yeah.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** It is Dr. Okay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** What do you want to do, Dr. Okay?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I'm awake.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** I'm not in the relax-a-tron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:16]** I think you're in the relax-you, but I don't think that you, like, you did roll initiative with a re-roll, right?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** So, and you took the worst of the two.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** It's been a whole year.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** Yeah, it's been a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Sure.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:27]** Then I'll, are we putting these dogs down?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** Are we putting these dogs to death?

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** I assume so.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Yeah, screw the dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** I would prefer they die over us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** All right, yeah.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:44]** Meanwhile, the dog in front of Rick is like... Does the dog have cover for me right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:29:09]** uh general perception on these dogs both of them yeah i think the one so just to remind the listeners dr k is in the room where the guardian robot and the communications were then out the door to the right here's is just outside the door about 10 feet south of it rick is just outside the door about five feet north of it and there is a creature on book ending


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:30]** the two of them okay so dr okay he's gonna move up to the door still inside the door he's kind of parallel up to bernice so you can see more of the sort of area i think now and uh should have a good shot at the dog facing rick right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:44]** Yeah, so to determine whether you have cover, you choose a corner of your square, and if the line of this corner to any corner of the target square passes through an obstacle, then you have some kind of cover.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:50]** So then you can check it, draw from your corner, so it looks like you have a full attack on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** Well, so any corner... Sorry, full attack's a wrong term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Yeah.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** You're saying Dr. O'Keefe doesn't have cover.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** You pick a corner... No, he... Yeah, there's no cover in between you and the dog currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Then there's nothing interfering.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** So that means that you have no cover.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** And neither does the dog currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** I don't think... Yeah.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** The dog could hit you as well.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** All right.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Okay.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** So what's it going to be?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** So Dr. O'Keefe's going to move up.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Okay.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** He's going to shrug off the... Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Uh...

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:23]** Is it soft cover because I'm standing there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Great.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Does it give the dog soft cover?

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Great question.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:33]** Creatures, even enemies between you and the source of an effect, provide you with cover against range attacks, giving you a plus four bonus to AC.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:47]** Between you and the source of an effect, I think it still applies that because there's no cover at all, we have determined that you don't meet the basis for cover, so I don't think that that's soft cover.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Okay.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** That's my take.

**[00:30:49 - 00:31:03]** It's tough to tell the difference between soft cover and partial cover other than just soft cover seems to just be if there's another being or something between you and the source of an effect, right?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** But soft cover provides no bonus to reflex saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:10]** It's through a square of an occupied future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:22]** Anyways, I'm going to try to shoot at it with a costa jet and a basic inhibitor to try and even further reduce this dog's defenses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:27]** pull out the cost of jet, the relax you falls to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:30]** I like the idea of it stays on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:36]** It's like whispering positive affirmations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Today is you got this.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Today's your day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** I think it might have hit with a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** KAC, right?

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Because it's cost of jet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Yeah.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Cost of jet uses acid, which is actually EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Oh.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Oh, you are right.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Costa Jet is acid.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Yeah.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Yes.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:05]** That still hits as it plink knocks off two of these crystalline pieces of fur as they fall to the ground.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** The injector.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Oh.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** But I only did...

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Five points of damage.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** Five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:22]** It's got minus two to its AC now.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** So this one, I'm going to mark it.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I'm going to use roll 20.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:32]** We don't often use the little icons, so I'm going to use them.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** I'm trying to decide which one is a good one.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Maybe the AC.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:39]** I'm going to use a battered shield on it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** and you were shooting the one that's in front of Rick, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** Yeah, okay, great.

**[00:32:44 - 00:33:05]** And you did five points of damage as this acid begins to cover the base of each of these little crystals, and more of them fall out, and you hear, you can see that the creature tries to compensate those muscles and shift and stand in a different way.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** Five points of damage, minus two to AC, incredible.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** That would be your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** As you have a certain action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Not at this time.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Although I'll say like, hey, guys, we should get in here.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** And then maybe you'll barricade us if we need to.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** But I think we could put these down, actually.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:33]** Can we do like a... I think Bernice do limited AI.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:54]** i don't see why not bernice does go at the end of your turn and she has the vapor cavitation pistol now yep enabled she's put away she's changed the knife over to a ranged weapon yep prior to this combat okay and

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Just a briefcase with a gun sticking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Yeah, a briefcase with a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** The knife retracts.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** The gun comes back out.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Nice.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:10]** And I think the other one, though, has pretty good cover.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:13]** The other one will have a lot of cover.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:31]** from you does this same one though bernice has a clear shot the same at the same yes oh yeah bernice does have a clear shot at the same one okay so bernice is gonna try an attempt to shoot with the uh vapor cavitation pistol okay give me that roll as this suitcase fires a gun

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:40]** Seven on the die, and that's a ten.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** It's probably not going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:48]** Wildly sails past the creature, singeing the wall at the other end of the hallway.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** It was still cute, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Take your time, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** You'll get used to it.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:58]** You see little actuators kind of course correct and try and aim a little better.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** It's like a single tier.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Comes out of the muscle of the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:29]** here's it's your turn what are you doing all right all right here's is gonna do a life science check to see if there's any distinct weaknesses it's a 24 a 24 let me just make sure i get what the dc is better not be higher than 24 he's opening the pokedex i guess yeah he's checking for animals he sees this wolf thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Great question.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Wolf.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** Weakness.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** Acid.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Sorry it took so long.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** I was surprised at what the DC is.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:44]** The DC to figure this out was only 14.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Scrub wolf.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Scrub wolf.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** That's good.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** You get to know the creature and then two things about it.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** First thing.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** This creature is called Attach Tarii.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:17]** And I like the way that they introduce it by saying the first glimpse most observers have of a Tachitari pack is a far off twinkling of lights, which is easily mistaken for swamp gas or the glint of moonlight.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** So they have supple filaments that cover the body.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:25]** So there's this, like, phosphorescent light that also helps facilitate communication for them.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** So they're from Castorvel.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:37]** They are also called laser wolves by some, fondly, by some off-worlders.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:45]** And they're not really... You can try and domesticate them, but there's...

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** Some issues, let's call it.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:52]** And there's also biotech based on Tashitari physiology, which is kind of neat.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** So what two things would you like to know?

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Weakness, for one.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** No weaknesses.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** No weaknesses, okay.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Any resistance?

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** Yeah, it has resistance fire five.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** So any damage, any fire damage it takes, it will take five less.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Here's tells that to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** He's like, I know what this is.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** They're not weak against anything, but they're pretty resistant to fire.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** Anyway, I call it laser wolves.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** It's ice.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** It's ice.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Love it.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** So, okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:48]** that in mind uh here's is going to shoot an energy ray uh at this one down here okay yeah because he can't shoot past rick right i don't think you would have in the way at least yeah well if if you go from the top left corner of here's the square it does meet

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** the Testari Square without any interference, right?

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** So that would be the same as Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:57]** But you are far enough... I'm still reading into the soft cover.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** It looks like... So you draw... You pick a corner.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** It doesn't matter which corner.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:06]** You pick one corner of your room, and then you have to draw a line to all four corners of the creature.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** It's the way that I'm reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** For cover?

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Period?

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Yeah.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** So half would be partial.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** What's 50%?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:18]** Yeah, partial is plus two bonus to AC, plus one to reflex saving throws.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:22]** Soft is plus four to AC, no bonus to reflex saving throws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** But soft includes creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** So soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** So maybe we get a plus four bonus there, you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Yeah.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** So for here's... It's not worth it.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, not worth it when this other wolf is snarling at you on your hiney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** That's true.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** He did attack me too, so screw him.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:46]** So he's going to shoot an energy ray of electricity.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** Okay.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** All right.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** And that is a DC of 15.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** What kind of roll?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** None.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** This just says 15.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** There's no saving throw.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Damn it.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** I feel like I'm missing something.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** It's all right.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** What's the spell?

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** DC is 15.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Energy Ray.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** It's an at will spell.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:27]** energy ray when you cast a spell choose acid cold electricity or fire yes the spell gains the that disruptor or descriptor you fire ray on the target and you must make a ranged attack against its eac on the hit it deals 1d3 of damage of the chosen type


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:49]** can he just he just rolls a d20 basically right and he's just like for your range you have a range attack yes right it should show you a spell i don't know i don't have a caster it does not say i have a plus three for that so okay so it's a d20 basically damn it it's a six plus the three so it's six


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:57]** So maybe you're still reeling from the ray that it shot at you out of its jaws.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:10]** And as a result, you try and take one of your cool, shearing hands, not your vestigial hands, and you try and underhand shoot this energy ray.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** And it misses.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Is energy ray a zero-level spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Cantrip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** They're not called cantrips in Star Fox.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Zero-level spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** They are called cantrips in Hero Lab.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** I don't know if that's wrong or not.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** It is a cantrip, it says, but I don't know what level it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** It says cantrip level four.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** If it's cantrip, it's zero level.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** If it's cantrip, it's zero.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Oh, I got you.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** Which means you can use it freely, right?

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Yes, I can.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** You can always use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Rat.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Rat.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Maybe I'm wrong about being called a cantrip.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** I don't know.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** I got to look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** I think you're wrong all the time, Jeff.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** I think it's called cantrip, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** I think you're calling it cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** It's not trip.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Everything's a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Life is a cantrip.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** What is the term cantrip?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** It's a weird term.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** Okay, I'm going to task you with looking up the etymology of cantrip, and we're going to move on to round two.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Cool, we'll do that.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Does that sound good?

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** All right.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Nice turn.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Do some story time.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Yeah, some story time.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Cool.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** That's a dog's turn.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:15]** It is the top of round two, and yes, indeed, it is the Tash Tari in front of Rick's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Wait, Kelly, did you use your move?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Did you move at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Do you want to move?

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** That's a good point.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** Here's is going to... I was going to move.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Here's is moving into this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** Rick sees you kind of stay still, and he goes...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:47]** here's get in the room uh he does that he's gonna move like right behind okay doctor the doctor okay and then next case by the good doctor by the okay doctor he's not good he's just okay he's all right there's a reason he's not serving in a medical practice he's great in combat though he only shoots people


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** even the ones he's trying to help.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:59]** As you get behind Dr. Okay, you hear the relax you, you faintly hear the voice of the relax you being, saying like, you are a strong slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** You're a powerful slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** You're a good doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** You're a good doctor.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Thank you.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:08]** You're more than just okay.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** It personalizes it.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** That's great.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** All right.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** So this creature in front of Rick.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Hmm.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** What does it want to do?

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** I think I know.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** It probably tries to run away.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** That's what I guess.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** You know, good guess.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Good guess.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:51]** does it run away no instead what it does is with the axe next to it on the ground and having been hit by the acid from dr okay it's going to look at dr okay and then look at you rick and then snarl and then that's his whole turn its jaw opens and it chomps at your leg to take a bite out

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Wow, I rolled a 19 on the die.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** Good first roll for the new year.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Am I right?

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** 28.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Are you serious?

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** Of course that is.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** More of Kevin's rants.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Incoming.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Coming in hot.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Going to only be...

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** Nine points of piercing damage as the bite cuts through your leg.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** And there are probably little sparks that come out from your android body.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** And it rips away.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** It rips away and a couple gears fall to the ground.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Biting you.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Tis but a scratch.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:36]** And then it's going to take a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:41]** Because... Oh, please disappear into a portal again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Go away.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:46]** Because... And as you watch it, take a step back.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** As you watch the portal.

**[00:43:48 - 00:44:01]** As you watch the portal, you hear behind you the... As the other Tashtari leaps forward and comes to bite you as well.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** From behind, Rick!

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Get ready, and it's flanking you.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Oh, wait.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** It has to be within five feet, right?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** It's no longer flanking.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** It's no longer flanking.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** All right.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** Still, I rolled a 17 on the die.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** That's a miss.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** That's 26.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Of course it's a miss.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** You're like, that's a miss.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** You have to roll like a seven to actually miss me.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** ridiculous.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:29]** That is 10 points of damage as it bites your other leg.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Coordinated strikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** I am now into my hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Oh no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Stupid laser wolves.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Good times.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Good times.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Good times for you.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Is it my turn?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** It is your turn.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Attach target on either side of you.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Your friends are in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:53]** Rick is going to take a garden step.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:59]** And kind of pivot around this dog so he's in between himself and... The open door?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** Yeah, and his teammates.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** Okay.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** And as he does that, he kind of just reels up his axe.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Uh-huh.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** And he's going to chop this thing across the neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Chop it across the neck.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Give it a good old swing.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Like, what's that Appalachian folk hero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Paul Bunyan or something?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Rick Bunyan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** I'm sure I miss.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** I'm sure I do.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Would you roll?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** I rolled nine.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** A four plus five for nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Yeah.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** KC is not nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Of course not.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** It's like 48.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** It's not.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** It's literally like 14.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** No, it's just a normal number.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** That's not below 10.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Everybody just huddle, huddle behind.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:49]** All right, so you moved, and you swung, and there was no gold in them there hills.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** I'm sorry.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Dr.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** O.K., it's your turn.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** What's it going to be?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Now there's cover.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Now there's soft cover.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** Now there's soft cover, so it's a plus four to AC.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** Wow.

**[00:45:59 - 00:45:59]** Yeah.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Not much to do.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Tough stuff here.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:10]** I mean, I can't, like, make Inky on Rick Square.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** I think you could.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** And then Rick would... Just also get on Rick?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Yeah.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** Rick would then just probably make a... It's probably athletics or acrobatics, right?

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:20]** We have to look into that.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** But for Chad, Chad wouldn't... Chadwick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Wouldn't be affected.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** What do you want, Chad?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** What's it about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** I think you could get into Chad's care.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** No, Chad would not be affected, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** The unseen.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Affected by what?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** The inky?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Yeah.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** An AOE effect or something?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** My swift action.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:41]** Yeah, my squirt of slime ink.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Depositing fluids.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** You can take damage.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:52]** All this combat's making you very nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** I know, we can't keep fighting everything.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** We're definitely not going to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:07]** This is... This is why, just for future reference, and I know that we believed it to be not a good idea because of time and whatever, but this is why I need to sleep.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Because, like, you know, for spells and s***.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** I could actually contribute more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** But that's a horror thing.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:22]** Well, I'm going to trillion... I guess I'm going to try and move through Bernice's square then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:47]** yeah that's probably fine come out and uh shoot at this other dog here and i'm gonna you'll take if you're going to the square you're going into your cheese up to the dog yeah take attack of opportunity yeah fair enough i think yeah i think if you wanted to move and knock in an ao you probably just need to move in the chat square because i think you can do that because chad's just incorporeal right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** If you do a ranged attack within a threatened square... That's also true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Well, I have more movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** But I think you... You would get an attack of opportunity if you leave a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Exactly.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** It's a tough thing.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** Can I shoot through Chad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Yeah.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Yeah, Chad doesn't exist technically.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** He's an invisible creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** But you would have... Chad can take damage.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** Oh, Chad can... Yeah, he can.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** So you would have soft cover then, essentially.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** So it's just plus four to their... To both, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** Oh, no, but it's only from area attacks.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Sorry.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** So you're fine to shoot through.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Okay.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Yeah.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** But, yeah, you would have soft cover.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Soft cover it is.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** All right.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Roll high.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:36]** Y'all need a good streak like you had on the robot where you were just critting.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Pull it out.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Pull it out.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Come on, come on, come on, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** What'd you get on that shot?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** 19.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** 19 against... EAC.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** Against EAC that has already been plus four.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** You hit.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Nice.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** This is what you need.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:06]** And I'm hitting him with the basic inhibitor.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Basic inhibitor.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** So that's the minus two AC.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** How long is that for, by the way?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Probably like seven.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Crazy.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Yeah.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** All right.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** And then how much damage you do.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:18]** And as you see the acid start to move through the muscles.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Five points.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:23]** Another five points to the other Tashitari this time.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Dang.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Little by little.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** This is good.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** This is good.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** This is not good.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** I don't feel so hot.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** And I'm going to swift action.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Oh.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:42]** Place some slime here on Chad.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** Chad, you might want to move out of this.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** And it's, I'm just going to use the slime.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Just do it.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Biohacker.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Or not.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Osharu property is swift action.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Yeah.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** I need to roll high for how many times per day I can do it.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** It's been a while, though.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** So I rolled a three, so I can do it two more times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Two more times.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** Okay.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Is this AOE?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Damage?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** There's no damage.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** It just makes the terrain difficult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** It's rough terrain.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:17]** Difficult, so it's twice the cost if you're meant to move through it, right?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Okay.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Smart.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Very smart.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** What does Bernice want to do?

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** I saw Bernice move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:28]** Bernice is going to, I guess, is there a way?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** To shoot?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Dogs?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** Yeah.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:51]** i'm trying to see the plus four soft cover well from bernice it's bricks in a way you can still shoot plus four soft cover yeah soft cover okay you wanna you might as well take the shot take the shot come on bernice is there any consequence from unwieldy uh great question the weapon is unwieldy yeah unwieldy special property


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:51 - 00:51:10]** unwieldy as they say in other parts of the world wieldy with the unwieldy special property a large awkward can't be fired who's going down for us okay so it can't do multiple as part of a full attack so you can't do it full attack okay for this one

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Yep.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Got it, got it, got it.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:16]** 17 on the die, plus three, so that's a 20 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:33]** And even with the basic inhibitor, the dog, the Tash Tari, is trying to correct and is not paying attention as the pistol fires off right through Rick's legs, hitting the dog square in the chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** There you go, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Nice.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Yeah.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** All right.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Right through Rick's legs, though.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** My goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:52]** I love it I love everything about Bernice how much damage to the Tastari the laser wolf of Castroville oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** I got a max.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:57]** I guess it's only for critical if I hit a natural 20, right?

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Yes.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** So I got max damage, though, 1d6.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** So six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** Six points of damage as it hits the creature right in the chest.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:13]** And the laser wolf of Castroville yelps, kind of yelps.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Meow, meow.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:23]** as it's just more of those awesome, beautiful... Wait, these giant laser wolves sound like Pomeranians?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Are you saying that I sound like a Pomeranian?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** I liked that impression.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** I thought that was a good dog impression.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** Are you saying that I sound like a Pomeranian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:32]** That type you did, yeah.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Okay, well.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Thank you, Kev.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** That's so nice of you.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:47]** More of these filaments fall to the ground, and you can see some of the skin underneath looks brown like a typical wolf's skin.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** All right.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Here's what you're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** I guess we're still attacking and we're not trying to take refuge in here.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Or are we?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** I can't metagame.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:04]** So I guess here's is going to say, like, are we get inside?

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Let's lock the doors.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:05]** I don't know.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Like something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:11]** We should definitely back into the room in order to avoid ranged attacks.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** You can't talk right now.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** It's combat.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Yeah.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Just saying, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** I could talk all I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Well, you could say like one thing.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** That's good, but Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:19]** You could say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Wait, really?

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** You could say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** One thing I thought was like.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** A monosyllabic response.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Okay, okay.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** One independent clause.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Maybe.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** All right, here says to the group then, are we trying to get in here to get away from them?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Yes.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** That's what he said.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Yes.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Get inside.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** All right, get inside.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** I have a plan.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** And then you're going to ready your delay in action?

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** No.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Okay.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:53]** I still need to get better at delay actions to know what the benefit in this case would be of doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** If you delay an action, you basically take your whole turn and move it back in the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:05]** But I don't... Whenever you connect that new initiative order... Yeah, you can be first to act on a trigger, right?

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** I thought it was ready in action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** No.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Ready in action, there's a trigger.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** Delay in action is just moving you in the order.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** I'd have to go look it up on the page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** Okay.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** If you want to take an action...

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** You can describe what you want to do and apply a trigger.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** That would be ready in action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:23]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** But, again, that'll move you into initiative order permanently.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** So, like, even if you're first... This is what we ran into in the very beginning.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:39]** It's like Rick had a really high initiative, and then he'd hold his action, and then he'd be last in line every time, which is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** So what the hell is the advantage?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:45]** I think we've... What is the point of doing that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** You would still get your turn.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** It's just from then on, you're in that same initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** I fail to see the advantage there.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** I'm missing something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** I kind of agree with you on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** It depends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:59]** Alright, well, not knowing enough about this... You could choose to act second, is what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Basically, choosing.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Might be a wrong thing to do, but fuck that, I guess.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** From a strategic standpoint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:12]** I mean, if you have any kind of ranged attack right now, you could do your energy ray...

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** I'm not trying to metagame too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** No, I can't do it.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Okay.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Well, I guess I could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** You can just try.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** If you're going to waste your turn anyways, just do whatever range attack you can.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** It's free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Okay.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** So, I'm going to do... Here's is going to do...

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** He's going to try this because he's going to try it again later.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:33]** He's going to cast a cantrip called Ghost Sound.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Okay.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:40]** Which, basically, you create a volume of sound that rises, falls, recedes, approaches, etc.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** And it can produce as much noise as 20 normal humans.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:50]** But that means that it can also produce a noise of a creature or a bell or literally any kind of sound, basically.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:57]** So in this case, like here's this going to, the range is pretty high.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:02]** So up to the north east, there's this like dark hallway.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:06]** So he can make it seem like the sound is coming from around the corner.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** And here's Cass this.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:26]** psychologically or like sort of uh with his uh telepathy and it creates a sound of like a giant alien predator which is totally fine i love it it's like super awesome from around the corner

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** just to see what may happen.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** The goal here is to try to freak these out.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:36]** Cause like dogs can be really tough, but if you shout at them or like freak them out in some way, they will run away.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:41]** If you show aggression, make yourself bigger and make Pomeranian noises as they run away.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** The scary giant freaking monster is around.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Even the toughest dogs will flee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:54]** Is there a, since it's probably like a will or a wisdom check, is there like a disbelief or DC or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Will, disbelief, DC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** DC 15.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:01]** They both need to make some checks.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:05]** I'm going to roll this die that we got at Gen Con.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Let's see.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** All right.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:17]** So you wave your vestigial arms and you all hear the sounds of this massive insectoid predator from around the hallway.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:21]** Probably strikes a bit of fear, even knowing that it's fake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** It probably strikes a little fear into your minds.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:31]** Briefly, if they knew it was fake, but they're laser dogs and therefore slightly dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** Go ahead.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:39]** You see them both turn and look, and then look back in your direction.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** I rolled a 19 on the die twice.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Yeah.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** That was just the die.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** They don't believe it.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:52]** They passed their save, or at least they're not going to go investigate at this time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** All right.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** Well, here is basically shuts the hell up then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Did you want to move still?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** You haven't used your money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** Uh, there's nothing, not really just enough to like make room for other people.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:07]** I'll just, here's when we move back a little bit.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Okay.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** We're trying to get in here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** All right.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Good idea.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** I like it.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** The die told a different story.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** That was a cantrip as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:22]** And as promised, I looked up definition of cantrip, which it does use cantrips.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Good round three update.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:32]** And also, cantrip is apparently, I used to not like the word cantrip, because I think it sounded kind of dumb, like you're tripping over cans.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** But it actually is a Scots word.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** It's Gaelic.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:39]** So it's not really the English cantrip at all.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:47]** And actually, long before tabletop games were ever a thing, it meant like a chant to create a spell in the Gaelic language.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** That's rad.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Which is pretty freaking cool.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:53]** And it comes from originally from a word they believe called canta.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Kenterext.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** Kenterext.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:05]** In the sentence used as, Anu begins the cantrips around the boiling pot.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** I don't know.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** I guess which is great cantrips.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** That's good.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Do we have any Irish listeners?

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** If we do, please.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Scottish listeners.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Scottish.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** Scottish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** If you speak Gaelic, please inform us.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** Anyway.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** Story time over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** But I'm standing by.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:23]** I don't think Starfinder technically uses the term cantrip.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** I think they call it zero level smart.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** I'm just going to stand by that until I see other guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Okay.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** But I do love the history of a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:36]** I think it's... I think it was a great round two update going into round three.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** It was great.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** It was nice.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:53]** At the top of round three, as you hear the sound and you see the Tashtaris look back and then hesitate for a second and they look back at you, there's a brief and all the lights go out.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** What?

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** Yeah.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** I believe all of you have dark vision.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Yes.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Or low light vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** I know I have low light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** I have dark vision.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** I have dark vision.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Dark vision.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Okay.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** And I'm pretty sure he has blind sense.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Does he have low light and blind sense?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Yes.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Okay.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:16]** So you're relying on blind sense for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Yeah.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:20]** For the duration of this while the lights are out.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** I have lights if needed.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Okay.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** Well, when we get to your turn, we'll see what happens.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:31]** It is going to be the Tastari up the hall, and it's going to make bold move.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** It's going to start to kind of...

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:48]** kind of rock back and forth as it then bounds five feet forward, leaps onto the side of the wall and runs along the wall next to Rick.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:57]** And as it leaps off, it tries to grab Rick's axe and disarm Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Holy ****.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:58]** Okay.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** So you need to beat my KAC plus eight?

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Yep.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** And you have a plus 46 to your attacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** That's a great question.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:13]** I think just based on this, if you all were going to do this, what is your KC plus 8?

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:18]** Or not your KC plus 8, but the attack bonus would just be whatever you're using.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** It's your regular attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Yeah.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:24]** So I'm just going to use their melee attack and go and see if it hits.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** Roll the die.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** I roll a 20.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** It's a 29.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Are you serious, man?

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** Dude, I'm rolling rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:36]** I don't know why, but I... No, but you're rolling rocks, plus you have, like, gigantic bonuses.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Like, I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** Let the rants begin, but also... Take my f***ing axe away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:47]** I don't... Rick just hands him the axe and then puts his hands up and says, whatever, I quit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** The dog lands with the axe in its mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** He just walks around the hallway.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** And shakes his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** Shakes his head and then drops the axe and looks at you and asks you to throw it.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** Hold on, I gotta look up disarm first.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Disarm.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:04]** You knock an item the target is holding out of the target's hands and on the ground.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]** If you have a hand free, you can automatically grab the item with your hand before it falls.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** And they did grab it with their mouth.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** The Tastari has it in its mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** They don't have hands.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** Don't go.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** Follow the rules, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:17]** It drops it onto the ground.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** It drops it onto the ground.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** It doesn't say you can grab it with your mouth.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** It says you grab it with your hand.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:26]** Okay, but for the story purposes, it grabs it with its mouth and then drops it on the ground.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** And then drops it like a bone.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Yeah.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** And your axe is on the ground.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:40]** And then the Tastari, the one that is right in front of...

**[01:02:40 - 01:03:09]** Rick is going to you see it also shake but then you see all the filaments on its body pulse and light up as it uses bristle flash and this intense light covers all of your vision and all of you need to make a fortitude save even from in here this is oh my god


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:12]** Wait, even from in here, John, we're kind of like away from all this.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** The door's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Yeah, standing right in the middle.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:17]** It's the other one that's standing right in front of the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** DC 12, Fortitude.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** I passed something!


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Yay!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Congratulations.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Both Dr. O.K.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** and Bernice passed.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Nice.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Okay, so it's only here.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:34]** And it makes sense here because you don't have dark vision.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** You only have blind sense and you have low light vision.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:41]** So everything for you went dark and suddenly you're sensing all these vibrations in the air and in the ground.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:49]** And then out of nowhere, you just see this glow and pulse until it totally overwhelms your sheer in optical senses.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:52]** And you are dazzled for...

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Where's my D4?

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** Dazzled.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** How bad is Dazzled?

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** Dazzled's, like, not bad, I think.

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** But not many people.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** For two rounds!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** Because Dazed is bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** Dazed is no joke.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** It's no walk in the park, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:12]** You're unable to see well because of overstimulation in your eyes, basically.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** That's what it is.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Well, that's fine.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** I'll just use my blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** What's two rounds of dazzle between friends?

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Am I right?

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** It's fine.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** Totally fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** Oh, you take a negative one to attack rules.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** Eh, it's not that bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** Yeah, it's not bad.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** You're bedazzled.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** You are also bedazzled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:33]** Is there an icon that looks better for bedazzled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** Let's see.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:41]** He's just like, if he had eyelids, they'd just be like, you know, giant eyelashes glittering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:46]** That's so great.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** That's so great.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:50]** That's so amazing.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Do you look okay there, bud?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** I can't see too well.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Do I look okay?

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:00]** Do I look okay?

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** It's Chad, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Middle of round three.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:11]** Well, to pick up an item is manipulate an item.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** So moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:27]** So Rick kind of just huffs out in frustration, and he kind of just reaches down, and he picks up the axe and just swings it hard on his way up.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]** He can't move after that, though, because that was his move turn.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Move actions to pick that up.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:36]** I just want to express my frustration because I rolled a 16 on that photo tube save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** And you could have rolled it on.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** Yep.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:50]** Maybe as you realize that this flash was coming, you put your arm over your eyes and then use that moment to reach down and grab it as you were sighing with frustration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:56]** He didn't even see the flash because he was bent over to pick up the dice.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** What's going on?

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:02]** But in a sign of relief, I hit a 19 on my dice.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** Dang.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** A total of 24 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** That easily hits as you catch which one?

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** The one that flashed or the one that disarmed you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** I'll do the one that flashed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:20]** Okay, so you caught it right after the flash as it is recuperating momentarily.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:24]** All right, and that is going to be a D12 plus five.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:30]** This one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** Yep.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** This one with second many places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:33]** Are you kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** He said seven points of damage.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Two on the dice.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** That's okay.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** Still going strong.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** But you cut into its shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:53]** as it steps and tries to rip the axe from the wound.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Good hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]** I was going to move further into the room, but now I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** But now you can't.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** All right.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** The Tastari is hurt.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** Definitely looking hurt.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** It is going to be Dr. OK's turn.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** Let's keep it going.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** What's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:14]** Rick, you got to get back in there and let's just shut the door on these.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** I don't know.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:20]** Like, I guess I can maybe get a good look at it since I've seen them now.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** And I feel like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:49]** yeah chad's like moving his way out i can maybe roll life science or they constructs what are they they are magical beasts that was that was you probably didn't need a role because that was part of here's his role if you wanted to well i don't want to give you something good sorry i i don't want to do your turn for you sorry no i mean can i identify this creature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Recall some knowledge about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:55]** I think you've learned everything about the Tashari that is important.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** And you've seen the two things that they do.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:05]** They have the muzzle awesome Kamehameha beam and that awesome dazzle bristle flash, they call it.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:05]** All right.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** The denizens of Castroville call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** Yeah.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** Well, I'm just going to try and put this one down then.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:10]** Put it down.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** With the Kusujit.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** And I did roll.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:16]** Okay.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** I got a 19.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:19]** Okay, your luck's turning around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Things are turning around.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** So, 23 to hit.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:25]** Yeah, that hits.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** Easy.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** More acid damage on the other shoulder.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:30]** That's not critical.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:34]** Let's see which... Which inhibitor you wanted to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** Yeah, if I wanted to actually, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:38 - 01:09:04]** further try and hit i'll i'll try and hit it with the uh pharmacological inhibitor the uh okay what does that do so you're gonna have to roll a fort save in a minute fort save fort save it is gonna use the threefold conspiracy die from q workshop oh max damage that's uh four plus four is eight

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]** Eight damage.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:06]** Wow.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** Hey, there you go.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:08]** Look at you.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:10]** Okay, this thing's looking pretty hurt.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:12]** First Rick on one shoulder.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:14]** and then acid on the other shoulder.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** The three-fold conspiracy die didn't let me down.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:23]** The conspiracy lives on as I rolled an 18, which is a total of 25 on my DC against your inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]** But you are still encumbered, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:26]** Encumbered?

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:27]** Okay.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** Dang.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** Well done, Rick.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:39]** You see this laser wolf in front of you start to look pretty hurt, and maybe part of you is like, this, we can survive this.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** We can survive this, because Dr.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** O.K.,

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:45]** is helping out his companions.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** I'm going to look up encumbered.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** Dr. K, you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:54]** Uh, Bernice can take another... Let's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** Stay in the fight, Bernice.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** Get after it.

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:01]** And then she's going to try and shoot the same dog through.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Dang.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** Okay.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:04]** All right.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:06]** Unfortunately, though, I don't think that one is going to do it.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** 13.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:12]** 13 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]** Because it was lowered.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:15]** Yeah.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** Well done.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:20]** Once again, right past Rick's legs.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Okay.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** So only hitting in the chest.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** Three points of damage.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:25]** Okay.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:28]** Only three points of damage.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** Yeah.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:33]** From a briefcase with a vapor cavitation pistol.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Beautiful.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:44]** You also seem to notice that the encumbered, it really is having a tough time staying up and moving quickly.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:51]** After that pharmacological inhibitor, it was a pretty easy shot for Bernice to take.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:56]** And I tell you that because the pharmacological inhibitor also says max...

**[01:10:56 - 01:11:12]** dex from encumbered max dex bonus to ac is reduced to plus two so you can tell like you have lowered some of its ac even further nice pretty incredible that's awesome here's what do you want to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** You're dazzled and it's dark.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Important point.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:21]** Dazzled will not, I think, affect my ability to attack because I have blind sense.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** Okay.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** It allows you to effectively do the same thing.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]** He's an insect, ladies and gentlemen.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** Exactly, ladies and gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:34]** So... Sorry, I'm not trying to ruin the game, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:34]** I read it.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:38]** I'm just going to take your word on it because of Blind Sense.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:40]** It says you're aware of location.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:43]** You're aware of presence, and I think you're aware of location with Blind Sense, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:43]** Right.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:51]** So Blind Sense is the ability to use an imprecise non-visual sense to operate effectively without vision.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:51]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** It's like bats, man.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:53 - 01:12:16]** pitch dark yeah he uses echolocation dazzled says you are unable to see well because of overstimulation to your eyes you take a minus one penalty to attack rules and sight based perception checks but i want to say that minus one penalty still applies technically i think that's the whole point of dazzled is depending on sight i know i know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:21]** that you're assuming that Sheeran navigate by sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** It's very, very speciesist of you.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Yeah, speciesist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:26]** I'll give it to you.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:28]** I just wanted to pull that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:34]** The construct, of course, is a speciesist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:36]** We can consult.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:36]** You're good.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:38]** If needed at a later point.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** Yeah.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:42]** I understand.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:45]** It's blind sense or blind sight?

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** Blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:50]** So it's an imprecise non-visual sense.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** Yeah, sorry.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Imprecise.

**[01:12:53 - 01:13:00]** You can perceive certain details and clues, but they're not sufficient for the creature to make out nuanced detail in the way that sight does.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** I guess fair enough, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:05]** Let's apply the negative one to attack, then, in that case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** Yeah.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** I'm sorry.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:08]** I just saw it once.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:10]** I realized it was blind sight, which is precise.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** That's the better version, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:18]** The blind sense should tell you which kind of blind sense it is, because you can have, like, smell, taste...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:20]** We'll probably get somebody.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:22]** I feel like you are aware of location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:27]** It should be the, it should be like whatever insects use for their senses.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** Yeah.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** It's pretty broad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:33]** Like it just says you can do scent, sound, thought, vibration, all of these.

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** It doesn't have a parentheses next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:39]** Some insects have a hole.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:41]** I think it's just because it's a Sharon.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** Yeah, and he's badass in that respect.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:46]** In many respects, I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:49]** He comes from a genetic lineage of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:50 - 01:14:14]** sophisticated creatures yeah you are aware of the creature's location okay i am okay so in that case it doesn't apply the negative one i'm guessing yep okay yeah full attack all right okay cool full attack tries an energy ray well i i can't do it doesn't give me any bonus i should say that my and i'll do full damage is what i mean if or i'll the attack isn't isn't

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** Blood did it anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:17]** Ranged attack.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Energy ray.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:19]** What kind of energy?

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** 23 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:24]** Finally, electricity.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** Electricity courses out.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:28]** In honor of the Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:31]** Electricity courses out across.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]** Suck on this.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:34]** arcs between Dr. O.K.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:37]** and Rick and hits the creature.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** Over Bernice.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** Hits the Tashtari.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:43]** I'm assuming the one that is right in front of Rick.

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:45]** This one here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:46]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:48]** And I have to roll a 1d3.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** It ended up being a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:52]** Okay, so two points of damage.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:54]** Two points of damage.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** Two points of damage as it hits.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** Three points of damage.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:58]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:58]** Okay.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** Three.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:01]** Three points of damage as it hits.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:04]** And it is getting close to death.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** You can tell that a lot of the filaments have dropped.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:14]** A lot of the Tastari blood, which is blue, is starting to drop and drip on the ground, forming a little puddle.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:20]** And it is looking just as fierce, but very, very tired.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** Close out round three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** What?

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:27]** Does it make a dog noise of any particular sort?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:36]** It doesn't with the electricity because it just shakes and more of the filaments fall out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:58]** sounds good um i think that's all for you you sounded disappointed i think you wanted to talk oh no i just wanted i was just thinking but i thought it'd be kind of nice to even be like again or whatever i can't even do the sound that you made earlier as it's doing it's like yeah i just want to hear it suffer i hate it i hate it hate testaries

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:01]** One day, Tastari, medicine will save your life.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:02]** Laser wolf.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:04]** Good, let's liquefy them and make medicine.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Are you from Castroville?

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:09]** No, I just don't like a giant laser dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:14]** He was from Castroville, and these dogs used to attack him when he was little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:17]** I'm not, but I don't like giant laser dogs.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:17]** That's it.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:22]** Literally doing gymnastics off of walls and pulling weapons out of people's hands.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** Doesn't sound like a fun time to me.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** I want them to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:25]** Next cutscene.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:28]** here's being attacked by a pack of dogs.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** That's going to be the next cutscene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]** Just chasing them down an alley.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** Just chasing them down an alley.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:33]** Fuck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:41]** As the electricity courses through the air, you see one part of it arc up and hit the lights at the ceiling.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:45]** And the lights come back on at the top of round four.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** You're good to go.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:50]** It's Tash Tari on top of Rick, right north of Rick.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:54]** And it is still upset.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:57]** And it's going to bite Rick.

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** You know what?

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** You know what it's going to do?

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:05]** In a last-ditch effort, it's going to take a step to the left.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:06]** A guarded step.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:07]** Sorry, to the right.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:08]** Oh, damn you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:10]** It is in line.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:12]** Let's go try to get my attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:15]** And you see the light come up into its chest.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:15]** Oh, no.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:19]** And start to glow as it moves up its throat.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:29]** And it's like... And just shoots this beam of energy at Dr. Okay and Rick.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:31]** Muzzle beam.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** That's a ranged attack?

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:36]** Yeah.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:39]** So I get my attack opportunity.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:41]** Do I get my attack opportunity before?

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:43]** Pretty sure it's before.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:44]** Yep.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:48]** Take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:51]** Who knows?

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:53]** What if you roll a crit?

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** See?

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:56]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:57]** Crazy.

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:58]** I love it.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** I love it.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:00]** Slice it in half.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:05]** Rick, in all of his anger, finally takes it out on the Tastari.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** It all comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:10]** He just sees it glowing, and his hands clench, and he hits...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:12]** Ugh.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]** Put that thing down.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:20]** And right as that happens, Dr. K, you hear the relax who says, today is not your day to die.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:23]** Right before the crit comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:26]** All right, so what damage?

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:30]** Well, you're going to do, so I roll twice.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:31]** Yeah.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** And you're going to do the cards.

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:37]** If I can find the cards.


## Speaker_0

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:37]** Uh-oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:40]** I'm just going to roll three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** No, that's not how it works.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:44]** Yeah, I don't have the cards.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:45]** I'm a little bummed.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:46]** I'm very sorry.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** That's on me.

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:51]** But you can do whatever the thing says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:55]** I don't think I have a critical effect.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:01]** Bummer.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:01]** All right.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:02]** Oh, critical effect.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:03]** It automatically kills.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:06]** You're lying.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:08]** Yeah, I'm lying.

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:09]** I knew it.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:11]** I was like, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:12]** Nice try, though.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:14]** You almost have me, rules lawyer.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:17]** To your lawyer training.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:20]** I roll twice and... Add the bonuses both times.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:25]** Okay, so it's going to be plus ten to two rolls.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:25]** Damn.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:26]** Because it's plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:27 - 01:19:27]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:29]** Yep.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** Two d12s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:33]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:35]** That's a six and a seven.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:36]** Plus ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:38]** Twenty-three points of damage.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:40]** 23 points of damage.

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:55]** And you swing and hit the creature and it is not dead, but it just lets out this like as it just is totally cut from the back half.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** Dang.

**[01:19:57 - 01:20:01]** Lots of blue blood spilling everywhere on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:08]** As excited as I am, I'm still irritated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:09]** I can't believe that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** I need to make a rage attack.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:14]** It's only 4d8 worth of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:18]** You could just run into the thing and we can close the door.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** Yep, you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:21]** No, that was an attack of an opportunity.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** He's currently shooting us.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:24]** He's going to get the attack on us.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:26]** It's going to hit you, Rick.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** I thought it was a line attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:29]** It's not.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:33]** I thought it was, but either way, it's still lining up, so it's fine.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** It's okay.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:37]** It's still going to make the attack anyway.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:38]** On you.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:41]** Yeah, you might go down, Rick.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:41]** Let's see.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:42]** Jesus.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:45]** Okay, I'm going to use the tiny D20 from Kraken.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** It's really tiny.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:49]** It's like half an inch.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** It's a 25 to hit you, Rick.

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:54]** Okay.

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:57]** There's my d4.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:11]** This intense ray of orange and white and blue light shoots out like a Kamehameha, dealing six points of damage to you, Rick.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:13]** That's not as bad as I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:21]** As it hits your shoulder, searing pain, not just into your shoulder, but into your memory.


## Speaker_0

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:26]** Oh, is there some kind of, like, rental?

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** No.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:27]** No.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:28]** Do a will save?

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:29]** I just love Tastari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:30]** Will save!

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:30]** Will save!

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:32]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:34]** You'll be having to do will saves for the rest of your life.

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** Yeah.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** Yeah.

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:38]** Just walk around a chihuahua and you'll be like, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:38]** Yeah.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:39]** That was its turn.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:45]** The one that is in front of you is going to take that opportunity.

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:51]** I think it knows that you are close to death.

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:52]** So the other one's going to bite you, Rick.

**[01:21:53 - 01:21:54]** Let's see what it can do.

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:56]** See what it can do.

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:58]** They're going to gang up on you.

**[01:21:59 - 01:21:59]** Oh!

**[01:21:59 - 01:22:03]** As it goes to attack you...

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:11]** It miscalculates its step and stumbles, so the jaws chomp right past your leg.

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:15]** As I only rolled a five, which is a total of 14 against your KSC.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:16]** But that hits.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:17]** That hits?

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:18]** No, I'm kidding.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:19]** Yeah, I was like, come on.

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:21]** I don't think you fit.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** You finally miss.

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:24]** I finally miss in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:26]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:27]** Can you take it home?

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:29]** That would have hit if I didn't put on the armor that I stole from Miko.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:30]** That's right.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:31]** From Quickfire.


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:32]** Yeah, Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:38]** Actually, Rick just kind of sees you coming and pulls his foot back just a little bit.

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:39]** Not today.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:41]** All right.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** Whose turn is it now?

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:42]** Yours.

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:44]** It's my turn again.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:45]** Can you end this?

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:49]** I'm going to keep using this roll of create dice because it's working.

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:51]** Saving your hiney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:58]** Okay, so just observation skills, they're both low or like the one, which one's lower?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:00]** They both seem really low.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:06]** The one that just missed is definitely, I mean, they're both significantly hurt.

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:11]** I'm not going to give you a number, but they're both pretty close to death, it seems like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:15]** I know, and I only have a plus five to hit, so like it's not worth doing the two.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:19]** So yeah, I'm going to do just, I'm going to hit the one right in front of me.

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:23]** It's a 12 plus 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:24]** That hits.

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:26]** That hits easy.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:28]** You don't even need to give two.

**[01:23:28 - 01:23:33]** No, no, because it's EAC right now, or it's KAC.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:33]** It's pretty low.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:36]** It's a lot lower.

**[01:23:36 - 01:23:37]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:39]** Wait, wait.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:40]** How many inhibitors do they have on them?

**[01:23:40 - 01:23:41]** I should have used five.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:42]** I should have hit five.

**[01:23:42 - 01:23:43]** Anyways, moving on.

**[01:23:45 - 01:23:46]** So, okay.

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:49]** I forgot I'm supposed to roll damage now.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:49]** Okay.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:50]** Yeah.

**[01:23:50 - 01:23:50]** Roll damage.

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:51]** My D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:52]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:56]** For eight points plus five is 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:57 - 01:23:58]** 13 points of damage.

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:05]** You slice down as it tried to grab your leg and you just pull back.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:13]** Slice the axe and cut the head of the creature off as the Tastari dies.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:15]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:19]** And then I'm going to use my guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:20]** To step in?

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:21]** Back into the room.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:21]** Okay.

**[01:24:22 - 01:24:23]** Step back in the room.

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:24]** Hell yes.

**[01:24:24 - 01:24:27]** Dr. K, what do you want to do on your turn?

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:29]** I want to close the door now.

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:31]** You close the door.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:33]** Tentacle reaches out.

**[01:24:35 - 01:24:36]** It shuts.

**[01:24:37 - 01:24:38]** You wait for a second.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:39]** There's still the one out there.

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:41]** There is still the one out there.

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:42]** I'll try something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:44]** Here's, what do you want to do with your turn?

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:51]** Here's is going to cast that, hoping that it's shocked enough, wounded enough, and scared enough.

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:52]** It's going to do the ghost sound again.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:53]** Okay.

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:55]** So, same deal.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:58]** Crazy scary monster thing from around the corner.

**[01:24:58 - 01:24:58]** Yep.

**[01:24:59 - 01:24:59]** That's a DC of 15.

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:01]** We'll dispute.

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:02]** How does this wolf do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:04]** Well, it's the top of round five.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:11]** And if I recall, there are no ways to look through these two doors, right?

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:11]** They're not.

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:16]** They're not, like, there's no, like, peek through them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:43]** right and so he knows where it is plus blind sense yeah so yeah exactly so you wait for a second you do hear the sounds of as the creep yeah i will add i'm sorry i will add john then i will also use my move action to tell chad to like go up behind this remaining wolf and just blow on its neck i'm hoping this combined effect might do something i'm out okay you blow on its neck and the filaments rustle a little bit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:43 - 01:25:45]** Wait, Chad is blowing on his neck?

**[01:25:45 - 01:25:46]** Chad is blowing on his neck.

**[01:25:46 - 01:25:48]** Chad is blowing on his neck.

**[01:25:49 - 01:25:51]** That's just something Chad does naturally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:52]** He's just like on his own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:55]** Completely on his own.

**[01:25:56 - 01:25:57]** Chad says, run.

**[01:25:58 - 01:25:59]** No, he can only do one thing.

**[01:25:59 - 01:26:00]** He blows on his neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:00]** Run, you fool.

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:02]** Flee, you fool.

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:05]** And the Tash Tari

**[01:26:05 - 01:26:12]** looks back, and then looks somewhere in the direction, because I think it can see Chad, but Chad's also invisible, so probably not.

**[01:26:13 - 01:26:23]** So then it's confused, and then it sniffs its fellow Tashitari, and then runs down the hallway towards Nico's body.

**[01:26:24 - 01:26:25]** Eats Nico.

**[01:26:25 - 01:26:27]** And you see Chad probably tells you,

**[01:26:27 - 01:26:35]** you see that right as it gets to the door, the green portal opens up and it disappears into the green portal.

**[01:26:36 - 01:26:36]** All right.

**[01:26:37 - 01:26:38]** And that's episode 52.

**[01:26:49 - 01:26:50]** Laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:13 - 01:27:14]** No, I'm leaving it in now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:14 - 01:27:16]** No, there's no sponsors, though.
