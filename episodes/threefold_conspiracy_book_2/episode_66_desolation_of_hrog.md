**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:22]** Our heroes hurry to put a hearty amount of hurtin' on the quantum troll hunkered down in the Grey's reactor room, but are forced to contend with the troll's humiliatingly devastating hidden healing abilities, which hinder any plans our heroes held for a hasty defeat of the two-headed terror before them.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:36]** Krog himself hurls debris hoping to harm the hair-raising creature, but is helpless to outmaneuver the husky harpy who harnesses energies from the reactor and its twisted genetics to heal thyself.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:55]** Meanwhile, Dr. OK fails to deactivate the reactor's ever more frequent floods of radiation inside the inhuman habitat, causing himself and Colin to endure more radiation damage than a naval nuke specialist, while Hears hopes to hide from the beast by turning himself invisible.

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:01]** But it's Colin Edenbrand who is the harbinger of hope for our heroes as he isn't the only b****.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:12]** who can heal, bolstering our band of brothers by burning a resolve point to nearly top up the entire party in the warm embrace of his healing channel and doctor abilities.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:25]** But the convoy's celebrations are cut short as the troll performs a quantum leap, teleporting into perfect position to attack the party's ally, Frog, who is oblivious to the troll's tactful maneuvering.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:31]** Will our troop triumphs include the trouncing of this seemingly tireless two-headed troll?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:37]** Or are our heroes in Harag about to receive a hearty helping of Havoc and Homicide?

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:41]** Find out this time on We'll Save...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:37]** God, they're never going to pick up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:12]** Well, it's it's it's good to put a voice behind a name, Mr. Podcast, though.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:43]** No, they first appeared, it says February 3rd of 2020.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** I think you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I think I know what I'm talking about, Mr. Podcast.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** I'm just reading off my records.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** I thought you said that you don't have a script.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** No, no, I said I don't have a script, but I do have access to the internet.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Are you really Mr. Podcast of Apple Podcasts?

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:58]** Yes.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Why did you call me?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** No, you called me.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Don't call this number ever again.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast episode 66.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I was excited to see where it was going to go.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:13]** I thought you were going to say, like, make sure you rate us and, like, that fun stuff.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** But you should.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:14]** You should rate us.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Maybe Marion will do this outro.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** I thought Marion was trying to rate over the phone.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Is that possible?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** I know.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** Please call in the Apple podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** You can mail in your ratings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** You can fill them in.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:30]** Maybe we'll do a giveaway around people who rate us.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** Who knows?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** Actually, I don't think that's... How can we track people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** The giveaway has to be open-ended.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Everybody violates some terms, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** And some morals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** Maybe if we get more ratings, we'll feel compelled to do a giveaway.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** We're only going to give giveaways to people who give us good ratings.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** That's definitely a violation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Screw the ethics.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Oh, five stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** That guy.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** That guy's.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Wow.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** That's so nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:00]** Also, rate us on Spotify, my personal favorite podcast app.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** There's lots of places you can rate us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** Yeah.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** That does bring up the question.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** This was the question I was going to ask.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** What's your favorite concert that you've ever been to?

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** It's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** I'm going to, I'm going to take this one.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** It's a bit of a weird one.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:21]** Um, so I saw, I saw Casey Musgraves at the St.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Augustine amphitheater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** And one shameless plug for the St.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:31]** Augustine Amphitheater, the Amph is a great venue for any music engagement.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:39]** I had won some tickets from AVL Productions here in Jacksonville, and they sat me right at front of house.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:46]** And unfortunately, my wife is not a big fan of concerts, so I ended up going by myself.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:53]** which like in my head, it was this really huge drag because I, I don't like to do any things by myself.

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:00]** Um, but like, you know, those people that talk about going to the movies by themselves and you can just enjoy it and no one's there to bug you.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Give me those weirdos.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:06]** It's that, but I got to sit in the best seat in the house right in front of the sound console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yes.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Casey was a great performer.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:17]** They definitely started coloring in the audience and jokes were had from the stage.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** It was a very good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** What's this coloring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** Listen back to episode... What was it?

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** 64?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** All right.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** 63?

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Disregard.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** I'm slow.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** I'll go next.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** My favorite concert I've ever been to was Poison.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Poison?

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** The 80s rock band.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, Brent Michaels.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:42]** I saw them in 2003 or 2004, and their stage presence was just awesome.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** I'm not a fan of their music.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** I'm actually not a fan of concerts.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** But I enjoyed that show.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** It was great.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** That's awesome.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:59]** I'll follow up quickly on that because, true story, Brett Michaels from Poison once tried to buy our old house growing up.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:05]** He came around several times, in fact, and almost did, but apparently didn't, obviously.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** But, like, a long time ago.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:18]** But I also kind of don't like concerts usually because, like, it kind of... There are probably some exceptions, but the concerts that I've been to, and I've only been to a few, the artists are, like, 50% less good

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:23]** than they are like when it's recorded and there's a bunch of sweaty people around you screaming.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:27]** It's a massive human flesh like colliding together.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** And I'm like, why am I doing this?

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** I could just be listening on headphones.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:35]** However, I get that if you really, really like someone and if they're good live, I could see that being cool.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:40]** But I suppose the best thing that I ever went to was a Tchaikovsky like musical thing.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** That was pretty cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Yeah, it was nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:42 - 00:08:08]** i think you do bring a good point though like the technology has changed the way like concert going yes because it used to be like oh you heard it on the radio or you had to go buy a record and then it got into like you know cassette tapes but like yeah seeing it live was a whole different thing but now you could watch concerts live digitally yeah that's not to say it is from from a technical standpoint it's come full circle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:32]** like yeah you have audience attenders that are used to hearing you through an album with 87 plugins on your vocal chain and you as a live engineer have to recreate that and thankfully there's companies like waves and uh um digico that are like making all of those things available in the live platform so that you can sound exactly like your album i didn't know that live in front of an audience


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:39]** Or even like, I don't know if it's personal shame of it, but I love Masked Singer.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** I've not seen it.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** It's so good.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** And they've got like five seasons now.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:49]** But spoiler alert, T-Pain was on one episode or one season.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:57]** And nobody knew it was T-Pain because everybody only knows T-Pain through his auto-tuned songs, which are fantastic.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** He's a great singer.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** He's a fantastic singer.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** And it's because he got marked with this auto-tune from the beginning that nobody paid attention when he actually sung anything.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** Shout out to T-Pain.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** You have a beautiful voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** Hope you're listening, T-Pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:17]** You know he's in the gaming... Yeah, he's a streamer now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** Dude, he's really good at Call of Duty.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Very, very good at Call of Duty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Shout out to T-Pain.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Florida, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** Shout out to Live Sound Engineers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:37]** Another embarrassing fact about me was I didn't realize that Flo-rida was the word Florida until I saw it on a billboard sign.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:44]** I was like, wait, that just spells Florida and the Florida shape was the R or something.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** I was like, oh man, I'm an idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** In his own world over there.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Will, what about you?

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** Uh...

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** What was the question?

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** Favorite concert?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** Yeah.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:02]** Or, I mean, I went to like a backyard concert once as a kid.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** Like somebody, like a local band.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** That was pretty cool.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** But I would say my favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Was it the Red Hot Chili Peppers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** I remember who it was.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** It was the Skull Adams.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** They were a local band.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Local punk band.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** Punk.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Ska.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Yeah, anyway.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:25]** I'm a big, I love the greatest cover band of all time.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Me first and the Gimme Gimmes.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:35]** And I saw them out in Pomona at this like small concert venue one time.

**[00:10:35 - 00:11:03]** it was awesome I've never heard of them I think the best live shows though they got all kinds of I think it's like the Fox Theater they perform there it's basically a collaboration between Fat Mike from NoFX and Spike Slauson and a bunch of other guys who are in small punk bands popular in California that's awesome yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:14]** I will have to say, though, the best live performances of the modern era are John Swan on guitar and on the microphone.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Hey, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** That might be me.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** You can also find him on Spotify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Hey.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** .06 pennies.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** Yeah, and soon enough as I release a single here.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** At some point soon.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** Maybe it's already out by the time this episode is out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Don't worry.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:38]** We'll throw your Spotify link up on Twitter the day this comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** I'll say the best concert.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** Well, the best concert I think I've been to is Jamie Cullum.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** It was very, very good.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Check him out.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** British jazz.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:55]** One of my favorites that I ever went to, though, was when I played in, I think I mentioned it, this group in high school called the Irving Clements Quartet, but we were only three people.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** That's not a quartet?

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Yeah.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:03]** Anyone who asked, we said that Irving had scurvy, so we were scurvy for him, but he was the vocalist.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** And we had a percussionist named...

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:29]** named mike evans shout out mike and uh he was at unf at the time for percussion and drums and one day mike and i both worked at the same starbucks at that time and so mike was like hey uh so i was working today and toka rivera came in who's the percussionist at the time uh with jason miraz like like was like with jason miraz from jason miraz beginning at like java joes and all this stuff

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:33]** And so he was like, Hey, I came in him and I talked about percussion.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** He said, if I wanted to, I can come to their concert tonight at the Florida theater in downtown Jacksonville.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** And I got a plus one.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Do you want to go John?

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** And I was like, yeah,

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** obviously for free, go like do that.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:51]** And, and, and so we go and he said, yeah, so basically he said just to stand outside the stage door and just like wait.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** And we're looking and it's like seven 15, not there.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Seven 20, not there.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** Show's supposed to start at like seven 30.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** It's like seven 25.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** And we're like, all right, kind of wait a few more minutes.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Uh, but they use, they start on time.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** We're going to like go.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** And literally as we're like, it's seven 29.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** We're like, all right,

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** I probably should just start to maybe like call my folks or like get a ride, whatever.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** The door opens and it's Tucker Rivera.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:19]** He's like, hey, I just remembered, came out, want to see you guys.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Want to make sure that you were here.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** I'm glad that you came here.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** You want to come with me?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** And we go on his tour bus.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** And there are two buses.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** One is Jason Mraz's bus.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** The other is a band.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** And he like sits us down in the back.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** He's like, hey, you guys want to color?

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** And I had never colored in my life at that time before.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** And I was like, sure.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** Cause I'm not going to say no with this toy musicians.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Like, Hey, you want to call it?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** And then he tells us how he's like a raw foodist.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** And we like chatted and then, and then he was like, all right, well I should probably go play.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** It was past seven 30.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** He was like, I should probably go play.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** You guys want to come in?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** I got you some seats.

**[00:13:51 - 00:14:00]** He sits us like not front of house, but like in the, like in the, uh, the, uh, orchestra, if you will, the floor, well, like five or six rows back and like center.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** And I was like, these are phenomenal seats to watch ASMR as for free.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** And, uh, we just hung out with his percussionist.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** It was very random and very cool.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** That's awesome.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** And then we never talked to him again.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** That's how things can go.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Until next time.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Yeah, until next time.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** And that's game.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** He probably listens to our show, though.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Oh, yeah, John, and call you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** It's good your first time calling.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Until we send Toco Rivera backstage passes to our live show.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Speaking of combining into one monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** We need five multicolored buses stat for this live show.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** Let's play and get back to the combat.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:15]** I'm kind of down to skip a recap and just get right into the troll quantum troll fights.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:44]** that's about it the troll was killing us until Colin came in and was like heal everyone it's so fantastic it's amazing love you what are we feeling for music we feeling rock or we feeling the like intense war drums and then rock or vice versa pull quick pull war drums war drums war drums first starting it up we also saw a dog eat an avocado thank you Huel I forgot about that option

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** That's true, the avocado song.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** Oh, forgot to ask Dice Cam.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** What's your favorite concert?

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Yeah, welcome, Dice Cam.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** Hi.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** What's your favorite concert, Dice Cam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:02]** Dice Cam's favorite concert was the Nutcracker Suite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Very good.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** I also like Tchaikovsky.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Well done.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Maybe we should revisit this Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** I always love when December comes around.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** I just don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Okay.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Totally agree.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** Well, Dice Cam, thanks for being here yet again.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Always a pleasure to have you on the show.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:24]** Let's get going with the combat.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** You need to post a picture of this now.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** We have to post a picture of Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** It's going on the website in her bio, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Her headshot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** Quick reminder as we get going here, I'm going to bring you guys over to the map.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:45]** Reminder that, you know, I think we talked about there's a connection between the manual workstation and the telepathic workstation.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:53]** And then also there is, you know, like your goal here is there's the troll.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** You could defeat the troll.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** The goal is also to stop the reactor.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** So I'm just going to remind you guys of the general sense.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** We could feed the troll?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** No.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** No, no, no.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Defeat the troll.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:09]** You want to stop the troll, sure, but you also want to stop the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** I didn't think about just giving it a Snickers bar and then it turns back into a little girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** We want to defeat the troll, so we want to take the troll's Snickers bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Yes.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** It's capture the Snickers.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** You're just playing capture the flag.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** It's just a minigame.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** You're playing capture the Snickers bar.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:32]** So we ended last time with the troll teleporting right behind Trog, who had no idea that that was coming.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** We're in the middle of round two.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Radiation's flooded.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** Colin has both radiation poison and radiation sickness.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** has radiation poison.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:47]** And then Colin also did a baller move to bring the warmth of Sarenrae to all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** It's like a high-level spell almost.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Amazing.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** And then the Quantum Troll teleports behind Frog and proceeds to swing.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** Take a full... Sorry, not a full action.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** To swing at Frog with one of the claws.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Let's see.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** Hoping you're okay, Rog.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** No sh**.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** I crit.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** On Rog.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Oh, come on, Frog.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** I crit on Frog.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** That's going to be double damage and add it twice.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Wow.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:44]** Yeah, this is no bueno for Frog, because I think Frog was just totally unaware, and I think the Quantum Troll just takes its claws and just stabs them into the back of Frog's neck, past all the fierce bone spike spurs that are sticking up through the Rivener's red scaly skin.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** and you just see Hrog...

**[00:18:47 - 00:19:04]** arch his back and just have this almost silent scream and his tongue flickers out and probably Colin and hears and Rick, you just see his eyes widen as clearly the claws have pierced his spine.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:08]** That is going to be on Frog.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Holy cow.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:12]** 30 points of damage on Frog.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** Good thing Frog was...

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** It was just brought up to full.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Yeah, good thing.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Thanks, Colin.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Good thing.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** Wow.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** Okay, that was the Quantum Troll's move and fierce attack.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:40]** Next up in round two, also just to note, again, I am keeping track of the fact that the troll did heal some more of the wounds and healed more than you saw.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:44]** Again, because of that radiation, because it flooded the area, it triggered the fast healing.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** So it's not just the regeneration, it's the fast healing.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Okay.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** It is Frog's turn.

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:09]** And I think Frog, you see Frog's head come down and just take on this fierce demeanor as if someone who is used to fighting through pain as the claws come out of the back of Frog's spine.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:15]** And Frog is going to immediately turn around and swing at the Quantum Troll.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** And where am I looking?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** I'm looking right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Come on.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** I feel like he's back in the gladiator cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** We're watching.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** Dude, he is.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** Yeah, this is the cage match with Frog right now.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** Frog crit on the Quantum Troll.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Yes!

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** Nice.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Oh, Frog.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Wow.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Frog gets hit.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** Classic glassy purple for the crit.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Dang.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Look at all these crits.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** A couple things are going to occur at this moment.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:55]** First of all, Frog just shakes off after that pain and just does an uppercut with the claws on one of the troll's heads.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Oh my god.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** Six and six on the die.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:03]** That is going to be first 22 points of damage.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Now it is...

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** 40 points of damage on the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** Not sure what kind of math that was, but yeah.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** I'm for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Frog's claws are 2d6 plus 10.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** Okay.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** So that's all of that twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:23]** 40 points of damage on the troll.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** And the troll looks incredibly, incredibly wounded.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** But, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** It turns around to heals for all of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Yeah, right.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:39]** At that moment, as the claws come up and rend part of the entire chest of this quantum troll.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:46]** That flesh falls onto the ground and begins to form itself.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:58]** And you see a familiar shape of a troll polyp appear next to the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** We just need to do deus ex machina kind of attack.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** What do we got to do on this thing to ultimately kill it?

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:24]** freaking like break it up into little pieces and then smash all the little pieces yeah i guess so it's it's it's the pigeons it's the elephants versus the pigeons thing yeah giant pigeon break it into a bunch of elephants i agree that the tiny elephants are better we are closing so many loops today there yeah wow so yeah just break it into little elephants


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Amazing.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:30]** So there's now a Trollpoll up here as well.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** That was Frog's turn.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:38]** And I think that's all Frog's going to do after being so viciously wounded.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** But the Quantum Troll does look like it is... It's not doing hot.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Here's, what do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** All right.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** Here's is going to not spook Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** He's going to be like, Rick, telepathically, I'm right behind you.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** I'm invisible.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Just heads up.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** All right.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** Now I'm going to charge your weapon.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** Set it hard.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Yes.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** And all right.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** And then I'm going to disappear.

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** I'll be right back.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** If you need me, you can't see me.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** So holler.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** And so here's his weapon.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** You're welcome.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** Supercharged Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** I'm going to f*** this up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** That's right.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:22]** And after that, he's going to move over to the console and do a computer check.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** All this he can retain is invisibility while doing, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** Okay, so that's a move and then a standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:33]** Yeah, Dr. Arcade just sees buttons and things flying around next to him.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Hey, it's me.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:40]** And a free action to do something like a computer's check, right?

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** Or not a free action, but I can do that as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** No, I don't think a computer's check would be a free action.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** To actually go in to do anything with it.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** So that's it for me, basically.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Okay, until next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** I think so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** Until next turn.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Okay, Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:22]** you sense here's next to you yeah seeing this computer sort of uh here's apparate sort of nearby but like yeah i don't really see what's going on yeah be like okay here's uh i'm gonna look into this computer bernice baby you should take a step back and uh try to fire one off oh multiple types of energy i got it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Yeah.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** Trying to turn off the regeneration here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Yeah.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Okay.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** But I want to do a computer's check.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** I'll assist.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:39]** wants to do a computer's check, but I'm just going to give... I think I can give Bernice... I think she can either just attack or she can move.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** I think you're right.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:51]** I think what she'll probably do is actually move because it's dumb for her to try to shoot close range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** To pull.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Yeah.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** Yeah.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Yeah.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:58]** That would not be... That might not be good unless you want to... Okay, so she's going to take a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Takes a guarded step.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** And then her turn.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Briefcase waddles.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:07]** I'm going to roll computers, I guess, to see what's on this console, right?

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Here's assist successfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Well, so this is what I'm going to say.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:19]** You all remember that in order to access this computer, you will need to also have somebody telepathically connect to the other one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Okay, here's, I'll do that.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** But you guys can't do it now, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Yeah, you can't do it now.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** Or, well, so do you want to still try and access it or not, Dr. O'Connor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:33]** Oh, so I'll just wait until I can telepathically link with, here's, Assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:41]** Uh, yeah, you don't need to link with here's here just needs to link with a smoky machine with the telepathic machine in the room.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** And then that kind of like unlocks things that you can move in.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** You can still try and do it without that.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** You can still try and have a computer without it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Can I prevent this radiation thing from going off again?

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Can I do like perception on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Yeah, I'll say this.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** You remember that it doesn't look like you are at the end of the turn.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** It's not flashing.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** It's probably not going to go off again next turn.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Oh.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Or next round.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Okay.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Yeah, so you're probably okay for now.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** So it's probably not going to go off next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:15]** Does that mean that that healing buff effect is no longer going to work for next round, at least for now?

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** If there's no more radiation, yeah.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** If the radiation doesn't flood again next round, then it probably won't happen.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Sweet.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Thanks.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Oh, I meant to do this.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Do what?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:27]** I was just going to make a cool square with green.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** And then that was going to be the, you know, that was going to be.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Oh, my God.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Yeah.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** I was just going to do this to show that there's radiation.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** What is this?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** The entire room.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:40]** Just to show that there's radiation in the area right now.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** It's coming from the ladder well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** It's a radius from the ladder well?

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** No, it's coming from these rods.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** I'm just saying there's radiation flooding the area right now.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** Oh, you're just like marking it on the screen.

**[00:26:51 - 00:27:00]** So just for the listener, John drew an entire green circle that touches all eight sides of the octagonal room that we're in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** It's inescapable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** We're in a cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Oh, come on.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** There's so much radiation when we're taken by radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** That's how Colin sees it.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** So I can't do a computer's check, right?

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Basically, or it's useless to do a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** But the possibility is low compared to if we telepathically connect into it and see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** I'm not going to say anything.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** I'm saying it's not like you can't try and access it.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:29]** It's just that you realize that that will probably help you in order to do whatever it is that you want.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** I'm not saying you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:45]** I'm going to tell here's like, hey, you need to telepathically link with that smoking thing over there and do your telepathic mumbo jumbo for this thing to work, I think, and turn and fire at the creature.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** At the creature.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Okay.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Love it.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** At the troll.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Okay.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** And so I don't waste my 18 that I rolled.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Can I apply that to this?

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** Yeah, just roll again because you rolled for that.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Of course.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** That is a...

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** What'd you get?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:12]** I rolled an 8, but I'm trying to see what I have to my Costa Jet.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** I don't think it's going to hit, no matter what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** 12, so no.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** 12, no.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** 12 flies off, hits the metal behind the troll.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** A little acid fizzes on the metal.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** And you miss.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Oh, late.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Unfortunate.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** But you're set up.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** And here's what I'm going to tell you.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** In order to really do that, you're going to need to take a full action next time in order to connect.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** So I just want to prep you with that now.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Is that what you know?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Understood.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Okay.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Bernice took a guarded step.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** Smart move.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** said, I'm not going to work on this computer until here's.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** It's helping me out.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Smart move.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Takes a shot.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Misses.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** End of round two.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** What is going to happen in round three?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** Well, first of all, Dr.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:03]** O.K., you notice on your device that the radiation starts to diminish and the rods stop glowing.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** And so the area is no longer flooded with radiation.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** So that means that Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** and Colin, you are officially eliminated.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** You are not on the radiation poison track.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Yeah.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Because you are no longer in it.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** I'm pretty sure as soon as you get out of it, you are no longer there.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:28]** But again, Colin, you do have radiation latent sickness, which is super cool, I think.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Top of round three.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** It is going to be Colin.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** So no longer weakened.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Yes, yes.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** You are no longer suffering under the weakened effects.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Colin, it's your turn.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** What you want to do, Saren Ray bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** Is that also true for Colin?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Yes.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** Even though he's got the sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** He's still the sickness.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** He's down with the sickness.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** He's down with the sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** He's down with the sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:53 - 00:30:05]** um ooh what am i gonna do how's my how's my boy rog looking i think i may how is he looking uh wait what sorry

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** I was just, I'm thinking through some options.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** You know what?

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Screw this.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** We need to take this guy down.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Also, there's a troll pole up next to it.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Don't forget, Harag is very good at taking things down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** He is.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Damage the shit.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** How is my boy Harag looking?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Is he bloodied?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** No.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Not in the mechanical sense.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** He's close.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** He's close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Okay.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** The way he's turned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:54]** uh colin boy how do you like a bit of this he takes his hands and gathers them together and thrusts them toward um steven since we've identified the little follow oh yeah we identified off air that the left head is named steven and the right head is named blue yep yeah uh solid yes casting mind thrust

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:16]** oh dang all right what's the go ahead tell us what i gotta do yeah so let us know mind thrust basically colin can uh define the most vulnerable portion of an opponent's mind and overload it with psychic information it's the portion that has to do with speaking publicly yes

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:26]** So, Stephen imagines he is in front of Congress working for Facebook without glue next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Based on a true story.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Based on a true story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Yeah.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:35]** So, Stephen now has to make a will save.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** DC 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** All right.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:41]** Fortunately, I got not a bad will save.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** So, let's see how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Let's see how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Thank you, Q Workshop.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** We'll save.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Through full conspiracy die.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** We'll save.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** I rolled an 18.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Oh.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** So I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Cool.

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:00]** So then you take half of... I'm assuming because it spoke that it has an intelligence score.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** Yes.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** Actually, yes, it does.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Kelly, you had your hand raised.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** We'll get to that in a sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Yeah, yeah, for sure.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I was going to ask Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** So 14 halved to seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** To seven.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** Does that only apply to one head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** No, it just applies to the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Yeah, it just applies to the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** And you see that head just... For flavor, I targeted the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Okay.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:33]** Real in pain, kind of pulling the shoulder and pulling the body from that direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Was that your question, Kelly?

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** My question was... What head did you attack?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** My question is about the heads.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** It's Steven and Blue, like from Blue's Clues?

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Is that what this is?

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** Where do these names come from?

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** You know, here's the mail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** One, they never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** It's good.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** They're good names.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I'm just curious.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** You do see over in a corner a notebook.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** There's a notebook there.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:58]** The mailman is just looking through down the ladder.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:01]** He's stuck in the reactor.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** Mail time, mail time.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Mail time.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Just like melting.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** Love it.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** The thinking chair smashed the pieces in the corner.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** The paprika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** The paprika, yeah.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Fantastic, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Don't hurt me.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Love it, love it, love it.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Mind thrust.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** Do you want to do anything else with your 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Um...

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:48]** i want to bait this one over here so i'm gonna move to there bait who the the polyp polyp polyp yeah polyp sorry colin is like on the northern part of this room and there was a polyp just northeast of where he was so i'm gonna i'm gonna step up i want to i want to get hit so i can flex that reflective armor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** Ooh, I like it.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** I like it.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** That sounds great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Okay.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** If you were trying to go for an AoO, you could have just walked past it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** I don't think he would have hit me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** It's an AoO.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** They're going to melee attack.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:08]** Because you moved into a threatened square, but if you moved out of that threatened square, so if you walked past it... Yeah, I don't think he would hit me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** I don't think he would break my AC for AoOs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:14]** Yeah.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** I'll tell you more about that in a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:24]** Yeah, I'm curious, because you came in, like, we haven't gotten to buy new armor or anything since level one, so I'm curious to know what your armor is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** Mechanically speaking, he is outfitted as if level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Okay.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Yeah.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Considerations were taken.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Yeah.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Okay.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** So...

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Well done, Colin.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Love it.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Yeah.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:46]** First, I have this weird thingamabob on my token.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** What did you say it was?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** You wouldn't tell me exactly what it was.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Just minus one to everything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Yeah.

**[00:34:52 - 00:35:00]** We forgot to totally roll for will saves to see again because first it was that you needed to see if you were immune to the will save.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** So I'm going to roll for my will save again, right?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** But I get a minus one to my fort save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** No, you're not going to get a minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** That doesn't make any sense.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** I mean, I don't know.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** It could stack of some sort.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Take a minus one.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** No, no.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** It's a will save.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** DC 10.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** I got a seven on the dice.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** We'll save.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** We'll save.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** And a plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Yeah, for 11.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** No, no, there's no plus four from that one.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** No, we'll save.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** You said to we'll save, right?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** Oh, your we'll save is plus four.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Okay.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** You are good.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** You're able to shake off the fear.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Bam.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:50]** So he feels, I mean, like from the healing that he got from Colin and then he shakes off that dread and he's going to march right up behind Bernice.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Okay.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:59]** And he's going to kind of squat down and he's going to put a hand on Bernice's handle and then hold and kind of like set the artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:04]** I'm going to tell you before you do that the troll is going to take an AOL on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:29]** how how the he's across the room how is this part of the troll power john come on what kind of bs are you like wherever he was he has like a presence where you can take an ao or something i see what you're measuring there it sounds like 15 feet away yeah i know that was that was me measuring oh yep by the way you are you are within crazy within what you are within


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** You're within the range.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Oh, this thing has just reached throughout the entire room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** It just does whatever it wants.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** 24 to hit you.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** You gotta be kidding me.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** I muted myself there.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:45]** 17 points of damage from a claw as it strikes you.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:53]** As you see that it seems like the claw seems to move through this quantum superposition state and hit you as you are moving.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** That's not how quantum positioning works.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** So his arm reaches through like a portal or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** I'm going with the Paizo science.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Sorry, what?

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** His arm reached through a portal, basically, and attacked him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** In a way.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** It's got a lot of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** It just phases out from where it's at and reappears on the other side of the room and swings.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** 17 points of damage to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Rough stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** I'm going to mark off a fail for the turn.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Yeah, it is stupid.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Stupid.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** You sound like Anna Delvin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:26]** So now I'm kind of squatting down behind Bernice, but only for flavor.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:35]** And I'm going to attack with my artillery laser because I pulled that back out as I was walking over there.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Do you use Bernice to aim?

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Do I get a bonus for using Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** No.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** No, it's just like I'm just trying to picture you squat down.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** You put the gun on Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** Yeah, kind of hand on top of her.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** I'm like, yeah.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** Thanks, Bernice.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Thank you, Bernice.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:56]** And then that's going to be, come on, come on, an 18 on the die.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** Dang.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** With a plus five for 23.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** K-C-E-A-C.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** E-A-C.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Heck yeah.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Amazing.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** That was actually Rick's voice.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Heck yeah.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Heck yeah.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Everybody's like, what?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Where'd that voice come from?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** Rick's a murderbot.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:23]** So along with this, I'm going to get a 10, 1d10.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** Okay.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** All right.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** Let me see.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** This one's my d10.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** I roll a d10 plus 4.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** That's a 5 plus 4 is 9.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Okay.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** And then, Kelly, how many d6s do I add to that?

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** 4d6.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Four d6.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Correct.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:47]** So I have these four poltergeist d6s from Kraken.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Oh, they roll pretty low.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** I got three ones and a six for nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Toss those dice away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** I rolled them all at the same time.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** I think that might be.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** I'll give them a second chance.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Should have rolled them all one at a time.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** No, no, no.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** You don't get a second chance.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** What are you talking about?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** No, not right now.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:09]** I'm just saying I'm not going to burn these dice yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** Oh, it's actually four d20s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:15]** Oh, that's wild.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** I also have four.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** Amazing.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** So, yeah, that's 19 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Amazing.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** Imagine rolling four A20s and getting four ones.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Amazing.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Okay.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** All right.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Well done.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** You want to do anything else with your turn or say anything else in your new voice?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** No, that was my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** That was your turn.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** That's your voice when you're in murder mode?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Hey.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:45]** Here I go to murder time.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Here I go to murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Oh, boy.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** His name changes.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** He's no longer Rick 19.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** That's all this murder talk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** I'm now Rick 17.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Murder away.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** All the previous versions were just murdery.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** All right.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** The troll.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Call it.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Trollpaw upturned.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:16]** Trollpaw's going to attack Colin because Colin walked up all strut and all cool and stuff.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Oh, man.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:27]** And you just see this arm form and then rush out and sideswipe.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** You try to clothesline you with its versatile slam.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:37]** Okay, that is a 13 against KAC.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** How does that do?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Swing and a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** It scratches the paint on his armor, but no more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay, okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** Chips off a bit of the Sarenrae symbol.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Yeah.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:55]** You're like... And glares at the polyp.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Okay, it's also going to take a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:14]** guarded step better take a guarded step you is it a tiny creature what size is this creature small small so it takes up uh half of a five or a quarter of a five foot square yeah pretty much it looks like no that's not how this works

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** That's not how the game works, Kev.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** I don't remember, because I can't remember.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** We played that.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** I played the Rexalite in that other game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Oh, yeah, the Rexalite.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** You could, like, occupy friendly squares, but not, like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** I don't remember if that was small or tiny.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** It might have been a tiny creature.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** No.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Steven and Blue.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Steven and Blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** I'm glad they go together.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** You know what to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** You know what to do.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** They're looking for a clue on Frog right now.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** And boy, I think they're going to come up with a clue.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:53]** First of all, the claw from Stephen's side reaches out to hit Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** The claw!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:02]** Wow, rolling poor on the die, but actually it might still hit.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** What is that?

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** A plus.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** And what is?

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** 46.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** It's plus 22.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** What is Frog?

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** But also ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** Whoa, that's wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** There you are.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** Just hits the KAC.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** Frog's KAC, by the way, is 20.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:27]** And Frog just gets hit with a claw on the dime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** It's going to be a D. Guys, we have to protect Frog.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** He's so damage giving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Okay.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:45]** So you see the claw sink into Frog's side as Frog seems to be definitely bloodied.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:49]** That leg kind of weakens a bit as Frog's arm goes over.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:57]** But Frog, with the resolve of an AAA gladiator, is still standing, however.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Was AAA good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** AAA!

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** AAA!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Or is that like the lowest tier?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** I was saying AAA like AAA games.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** It's like the best.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** The top of the top.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** That's what I was asking.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** I don't know.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** Top of the top gladiator.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Get on your Akiton gladiator rankings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** Isn't like major leagues would be like... So he's like just below the major leagues?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Uh...

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** No, he's in the Major League.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:25]** Triple A ball is below the Major League ball, but this is not the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** I mean, he's like Mike Tyson status.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** I mean, he was a fighter.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** Is Mike Tyson a Triple A fighter?

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** Or he's a Holyfield or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:39]** Well, I think it's also important to point out that Riveners are much larger than what a Kesti is, right?

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** That's true.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** They are large creatures.

**[00:43:42 - 00:44:05]** right yeah well i thought they were normal or medium uh no you're right they're small they're small so yeah casties are small but riveners are large freaking large put that together yeah when he when when he was uh a gladiator he was small yes okay so here's the thing you see frog


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** The claw comes into the side.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Frog.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Nice.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Nice.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** And tries to shake it off.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** Shake off this deep gouge in his side.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** But as he does, he turns back.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:23]** And Blue's face comes down and rips into Frog's shoulder.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:32]** And then Steven's face rips into Frog's other shoulder as they bite Frog.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** What skill is this?

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** What's going on?

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** They have a thing called two-headed maul.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** I'll get into it at another time.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:45]** Because they are able to hit if they get two successful hits between their claw and their bite.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** And they can do another one at a penalty.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** And they did.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** Frog has nine hit points left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Okay, let's get Frog.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** And you have to roll the damage now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** So you're saying if you roll nine... No, that's after everything.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Oh, so he's still alive.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** He's still good.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:17]** But you see that Frog's head lolls back and then lolls to the side as the troll literally just grabs Frog and then just rips up, ripping through the shoulders and whatever might be left of that muscle and sinew on Frog.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** I don't know.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** He might not.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** It's going to be Frog's turn now.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** What is Frog going to do?

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Run away!

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** Frog doesn't run away.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** Hogs aren't the type to run away.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:40]** I think Frog... Today, I might die, but so will you.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:44]** And then Frog goes and does a full action attack.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:53]** Two attacks, two claws on the troll, almost like he's trying to bear hug and just dig in with the claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** But his arms are dislocated, so they just kind of swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** They just kind of swing loudly.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** Here you go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** I'm going to hit you, I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** I'll get you.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:06]** That is a 23, which does hit.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Yes.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Good.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:17]** It's going to be 18 points of damage on the first hit to the Quantum Troll, which is crazy.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Second attack.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:58]** just misses first claw digs in but you see the quantum troll is feeling like it's close to death as you see that it is just wincing and is able to push frog off at the last second before the claw comes in which is why it misses here's what do you want to do here's is going to take a full action to telepathically connect to whatever that is that he needs to telepathically connect to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** And he will do that, and then he'll... Smoking machine, right?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Yes.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Smoking machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** He will telepathically communicate to Doctor, okay, I'm ready when you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Love it.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** OK, so you telepathically you communicate to Dr. OK.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:28]** And as you link to the machine, it does feel like all of the the programming for the computer is almost like you can see it and you can see it almost behind like a smoky glass wall.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** And you're able to will the wall to move out of the way.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:38]** And that allows the actual manual computer to be set up.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** So well done.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** That's your full action.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Dr.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:51]** I'm going to interface with the computer, and I'm going to ask please to assist me with that.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** Bernice, we may need you here at the console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Here's we'll also assist with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:58]** Okay.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** So now, Dr.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:04]** O.K., you can attempt to gain access, and –

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Okay.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:12]** This first time, you're going to get a plus two, Dr. Okay, if he successfully is able to aid you.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Okay.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Great.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** So it's a plus two.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** Give me one sec to see what the DC is.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:25]** I hope that this is enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:32]** I rolled a nine plus 11 on my normal computers is 20 plus Bernice assisting.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Plus here, it's still 24.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Yeah, Bernice assists, so 24.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Okay.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Okay.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** It's just to gain access, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** I'll tell you.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** You didn't get it, but you were very close.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** I'm going to tell you what you see.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:54]** And maybe as you were going through, you saw that control that you needed to get to, and you just missed it because you were close.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Yeah, it's DC 25.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** You were very close.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:03]** So when you didn't get the check, but I'll tell you what you see.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** You saw three options.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** A menu comes up that allows you to control the reactor.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:16]** The first option allows you to shut down the whole reactor, avoiding any meltdown or sanitation wipe.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Avoiding this whole thing.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** Basically what you've been told.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:25]** Another option, shut down and power up again after a timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Restart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** And then just restart, come back on.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** All control delete.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:36]** In the meantime, power will be handled by, you know, like emergency generators, other sources, right?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:43]** Third one, shut down and power up again later and meltdown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:45 - 00:50:01]** so you can tell it the time to stop now yes yes think about that you so that is a full action by the way between the two of you it has to be a full action on the mental side has to be full action to access on the computer side


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** All right.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:07]** Hey, should we shut this thing down or should we melt it down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:10]** Wasn't the idea to just shut it down?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Otherwise, we're, like, screwed.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** We don't have a way off of this place yet.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:17]** We should probably talk to those two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** That's the troll.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** That's the troll.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** See what they think.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Hey, Blue!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:28]** No, the... Oh, to the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:34]** Well, I mean, the stewards got here somehow, so presumably they said that they could get you off if you were able to help them.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Presumably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I don't know if I trust those guys.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Okay.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** But yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Oh, man, I don't know how Rick feels about this.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** Like, should...

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** I think Kevin would be like, no, melt this down in a day.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** But we can schedule it.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** I don't know how, Rick.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** That's what it says.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** You shut it down and we'll start up later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** Yeah, you have about 12 hours.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:58]** There's a window of 12 hours between cooldown.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** So a max 12 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** There's no way to reboot it after that.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** We can initiate the meltdown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** We reboot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** That's literally what's happening right now is that it's melting down, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Yeah, that's what's happening right now.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** You can also turn it off and then just have it reboot and be fine.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** So you're basically hitting the snooze button on the meltdown.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:22]** Well, you can either hit snooze button on the meltdown, restart, and come back fine, or just turn it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:30]** So is the implication that someone before us came through and told it to meltdown at a later date?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** No, I think it's implying that somebody told it to meltdown in the first place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:39]** No, this is sanitation, I thought, protocol is different, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** No, it's the same thing.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:48]** The whole point is that because of the bombardment from the stewards and because of the systems that they damaged, it went into this meltdown procedure.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Yeah.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Got it.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** Which you think could be part of the programming.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** Maybe the grays put that in because they are hella paranoid about their own tech, right?

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:02]** Like, to be honest, you've never seen any identifying information being like, this is a gray place to, you know, like.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Have a great day.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Have a great day.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Gray day.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:08]** You know, like, grays love working here at so-and-so.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** Like, they are very pertinent about it.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Kelly, your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:18]** Here it says, I think that we don't really stand to benefit anything from this place melting down.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** I think it's only going to cause us problems.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** So we should probably stop it and get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Shut it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Okay.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** What do you think, though?

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:32]** I mean, there's probably some valuable information that can be gathered from this place as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Reboot time.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** let's move forward with round four while you guys think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:41]** Yeah, I'd say you two are having this conversation telepathically, so Colin and I don't have a clue what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Colin, it's your turn.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Top of round four.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** What's going to happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:44 - 00:53:06]** um colin is going to uh step around to here and i'll do it where to come here i'm gonna take a few steps south to the east so that i can stay next to my buddy frog did you walked past that's an attack of opportunity from both yep yep creatures let's get it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** He knows that.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Yeah.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** All right.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** To peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Paladin.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Both from the... Okay.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** So the polyp... Everything Vinny does is like pre-planned.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** So the polyp rolls.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Got a 19 on the die.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** So I think that... Sucks to suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Sucks to suck.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** It doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** You know why?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Great.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Reflecting armor?

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** No, because of my mobility.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:39]** I get a plus four to AC versus attacks of opportunity provoked by leaving a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** They rolled a 30 on the die.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** They rolled a 30 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Cool.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** You said it rolled a 19.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** I thought you meant it rolled a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** I rolled a 19 on the die.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** No, I rolled a 19 on the die.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** No, 30 definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** 30.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Okay.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** All right.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** That's 11 points of damage.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:07]** As this slam from the polyp cuts you in the back as you're turning to run away, and you need to make a reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Okay.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** And now your reflecting armor kicks in, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:15]** I think after this resolves, I'm pretty sure that fails.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** That's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Oh, you are entangled.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:45]** by the slam as the polyp it like hits you in your legs and your legs start to freeze up let me go back to entangled and see i think you can move half speed when you're entangled or is it you can't move at all let's see ensnared impedes your movement but does not entirely prevent you from moving you move at half speed cannot run or charge minus two penalty to ac attack rolls reflex saving throws initiative checks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** And dexterity base.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Wow, this sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:47]** Yeah.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:56]** You can give me an acrobatics check as a move action on your turn, which is your turn right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:06]** So before that finishes resolving, Colin is going to trigger his reflecting armor.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Oh!

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:11]** Make a DC 15 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** You make a DC 15 reflex.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Roll the 15 on the die.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** It's a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Woof.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Cool.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** So it takes... Woof.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Reflex half.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** So it takes five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** Five points of damage to the polyp.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Okay.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Woo!

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** All right.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** And did you take all 11, or did you take five less?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** That's what I'm looking.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:38]** Takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage dealt at the time the spell is dismissed.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure I just take full damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Okay.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** That's 11 points of damage.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** I like the reflecting armor, though.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Just having it roll well enough.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Dang.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** And you are entangled.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** So you move half speed.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** And unfortunately, you are going to get hit by the troll wolf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Does reflecting armor work on both attacks?

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Can it work twice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** No, it's just once per cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:10]** That is a 24 to hit from the troll attacker opportunity.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** 24?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** Yeah, with its claw.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Oh, you know what?

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** That works because I'm entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Oh, because you have minus two.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Because you're entangled.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** All right.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** You've done some crap.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:31]** 17 points of damage as this claw materializes and just rips through the symbol of Sarenrae on your chest.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** How are you looking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** That hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** You pass stamina points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** I have just reached the end of my stamina points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** You're getting off the Stamina Point car into the Hit Point car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Got it.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** All right.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** But you still move.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** But I still move.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:52]** And I'm going to cast Mystic.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** So Cullen is going to reach out to Frog.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** Boy, friend, let me help you with that.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:09]** And puts his hand on Hrog, and you see a glow from his hand into Hrog, sort of like E.T.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** 's finger.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** Okay.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:17]** And Hrog is rejuvenated for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Dang.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Ouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Hopefully this roll doesn't suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Elliot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:31]** It's 14 plus my wisdom modifier, which is four.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** So 18 points.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Let me see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Hit points.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** Conversation for a different time, but that was my favorite ride at Universal Studios.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** The E.T.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** ride?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Yeah.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** That's good.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Dang.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:50]** 18 hit points, and then that overflows into stamina if that fills the stamina.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** He doesn't have stamina.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** Dang, 18 is great.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** Dang, so Frog is at 27 now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** Hog is sitting all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:10]** Dang, you see Frog seems to notice you, and I'll tell you what he does on his turn as a response to you.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Well done, well done.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Excellent.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** Rick 19, what's your plan, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Yeah.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Finish him.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:22]** I think Rick's going to just take another shot at the troll.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Okay.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** Oh, okay.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** Yeah, that didn't work.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Okay.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** I got an 11 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** Flies past, hits the wall behind you.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:41]** I forgot at the top of the round, the green rods start to glow.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:49]** So they start to glow, and radiation starts to flood the area.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** I'm going to give you, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** I thought we could do the cancel thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:53 - 00:59:01]** You had an opportunity to do that, but that is a move action, and you also have to spend a full action in order to hack.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** I'm a bonehead.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** I should have shot twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** Okay, well, Bernice can hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:09]** Okay, let's have Bernice give me a DC 10 reflex save.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** Because I'm going to say it just started to happen, and then it's about to happen now.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** So can you turn it off if Bernice hits DC 10?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** Dice cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Hey, hold on.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Sorry.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** I just want to look it up.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** So we do it before...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:47]** i'm gonna take a second just jeff on discord uh was explaining like the odds are you should always just do a full attack and shoot twice um and i should have shot twice and i didn't because that three three would have just been a plus four and then roll again still didn't hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** No, I can't see, but it looks like two digits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** It's 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:56]** Dude, Bernice knocks it off, so it didn't even come through this round.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Well done, Bernice.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Excellent.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Well done.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:04]** No radiation, so you guys don't need to make checks again for the radiation.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** So it shut down now?

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** No.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** That's 21, by the way, her reflex save.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** It didn't flood this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:15]** Wait, so there's like a saving throw to stop it from radiating?

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Kev, are you listening?

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** I was, but I thought you guys were talking about shutting down the reactor altogether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:23]** So there's a... The computer said, bop it.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** And Bernice bopped it.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:25]** Bopped it, bopped it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:30]** Yeah, that's for the flood of radiation that happens from the reactor.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Yeah, there's an alarm that goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Way to go, Bernice!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** Bernice, for the win!

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** All right.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Rick19 misses.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Sorry, Rick.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** It is the Trollpollop's turn.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Next time I'm shooting twice.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** Trollpollop is going to...

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** take a guarded step.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Let's see.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:47]** Let's see.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]** Let's see what's going to happen here.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Okay.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:57]** Troll Pop is going to take a guarded step here and then swing at Colin.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:02]** Colin, I don't want you to die, but you might die.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** Are you sure about that?

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:11]** That is a 17 against KAC as it slams into you with its other arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** That would work if I was not entangled.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** I would have survived that, but since I'm entangled, that ties, and ties go to the roller, so yes, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** Dang!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** 12 points of damage!

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Colony, okay.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]** Yeah, as the slam hits you again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:44]** So I imagine he strikes me exactly where he hit me before, but rather than there being armor there, it's just flesh, and so... Rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** Just throw salt into the wound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** Rough, rough, rough.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** Okay.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** Well, that was the troll pop's turn.

**[01:01:52 - 01:02:02]** And I will say that as it swings through, you see that some of the damage that you did to it, Colin, seems to re-knit itself because it has the same versatile regeneration as the troll.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** They're one and the same.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** So it got five hit points back.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Things are getting close.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:16]** I feel like I need to put on the rock music to keep this going because I feel like you guys are at the precipice of making a change.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** So I'm going to put it on because I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** Thank you.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Thank you, Huel.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** Appreciate that.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Huel.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Huel.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** Fantastic.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Whoa.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Whoa.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** The troll.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Steven Blue.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:47]** Seeing that Frog has been helped, but already having taken out Colin, who healed Frog, I think the troll knows Frog and wants to take Frog out.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Of course he does.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** Rick19 missed.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]** Can this troll do it?

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Let's find out.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** First roll from the claw from the quantum troll.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:06]** That is going to be... 26 to hit.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** Which hits rock.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:14]** Six plus... All right.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Frog has 27 hit points.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** 17 of those are gone.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** He is at 10 hit points.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:26]** If the Quantum Troll hits again, he will get a third attack at a minus 4.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:33]** I wish I had a dice cam so I could show you what I rolled, but I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** One day, dice cam will come.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Natural 1.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:37]** Natural 1.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Come on, natural 1s.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Oh, my God.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** It's a natural one.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:44]** John's covering his face with his eyes closed.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** We could have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:48]** Please.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** Just say it.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Just say it, John.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Just say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Tell us what it was.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** To shreds, you say?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** What happened?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** I saw the Kraken symbol.

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:00]** It's looking at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** To critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** Come on.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:06]** I think... You said you saw the Kraken symbol, but it rolled past you.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** But rolled past.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** I saw it as a sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** It rolled past the Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** Oh, Rob, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** Yeah.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Well, so here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** We'll probably find out next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Please don't say that.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Don't say those words.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** Oh, man.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Don't say those words.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** We can knock this up.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Wow, those are really good words, Will.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** Those are really great words.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** Those are really, really nice words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:36]** This is just a messed up fight because it's like, here's the biggest, hardest creature you've ever fought, but at least two of you have to be over at this computer doing absolutely nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** I know.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** It's nonsense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** There is that.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** There is that.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** And if we didn't have a telepath in the group, we'd be totally screwed.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Yeah, we got lucky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]** Also, we just prevented the room from healing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:59]** Which saved another five, and it prevented you all from having another radiation sickness and taking seven points of damage, which is key, because not all of you are doing the best.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Particularly Frog.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** Particularly Frog.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** I think this is what happens.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:12]** Colin, you reach out, and you point with your light on Frog, and Frog is like,

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:19]** And then turns and kind of side eyes you.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** There's like a slight smile.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Then Frog.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:26]** Winks at you.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** And as Frog winks.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Because this is all happening.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** The turn all happens roughly in the same time.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** Frog's plan.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** I'm going to tell you right now.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:38]** Frog's plan to push and grapple.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** So that way the troll could not attack.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** To like really hold it in place.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:57]** And I think right as Frog starts to lift up and out, the troll takes his claws and just digs into Frog's body.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:14]** And you see Frog lift up and stop in his tracks and then smile because Frog has done what he could

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** To save you.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** To die fighting.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** And to die trying to help you out.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:26]** And you were the ones who said, come with us.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Make it happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:32]** We must defeat this troll for Frog.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:33]** Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** And Frog falls to the ground, lifeless.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:37]** Frog.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** And that is our game.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:48]** I feel like I ruined this episode.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:51]** This was the hardest death for me to experience, for sure.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:53]** For sure.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** More than Nico, more than...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** Everybody on the Chimera.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Yeah.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** I'm not going to lie.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Harag is my favorite character.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** He is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** I started to tear up a little bit right then when I was, like, thinking that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** So I pictured, like, two separate things.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:17]** Like, one was, like, the anime-style, like, last final fight scene where Harag, like, heroically, like, lifts his head and then he's just like...

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:17]** Yeah.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** And then, like, a spat of blood comes out.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** Yes.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** And then he falls.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:26]** But then I also was trying to make some kind of, like, Game of Thrones, like, hold troll.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Yep.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** And then I was trying to think of a G word they could shove in there.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:32]** So that was how we got the word rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:35]** Hold troll rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:38]** It reminded me of Game of Thrones death, too.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:40]** That was well done.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** But also sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Rest in peace, Grog.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** Rest in peace, Grog.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** We will not let you die in vain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** No, we're all going to die.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** Hey everyone, it's Kelly.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** I am really heartbroken over the passing of Frog.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:05]** I really wanted us to go on this great adventure and to have this NPC that was with us all the time throughout the rest of our campaign.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:09]** And to have John have to play him the rest of the time, that would be really fun.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** But alas, it was not meant to be.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:18]** RIP Frog, I'm glad you at least got your revenge and I'm glad you at least got to die with friends.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:23]** And I just want to thank everyone for sharing this moment.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:25]** And I hope that we can commiserate together.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:31]** And just want to say, before it's too late, that I appreciate you.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:42]** I'll see you next We'll Save Wednesday.
