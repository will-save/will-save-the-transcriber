**[00:00:00 - 00:00:15]** Previously on WillSave Our crew finds out that not every plush toy is fun for the whole family, as this fiendishly fun-sized foe cuts into Dr. OK for a punishing amount of damage.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:37]** Round after round, our crew hurls insults and blows in an attempt to kill the construct's spirits, and in its final moments, a glimmer of hope shines for our furry figurine, realizing the error of his ways, only to find out it's too late, as Rex swings his axe for more damage than its collectible resale value.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:41]** Has our crew finally found some respite from this horrifying child's play?

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:46]** Or is our crew playing right into the hands of some demonic puppet master?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:58]** We're going to go to our first kid whose name rhymes with Billiam Barrett.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:07]** What's a cool thing that you did, young Billiam Barrett, that no one would know what you did when you were a kid?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** Oh, illegal things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:40]** I mean you were a kid so plus statute of limitations just say it or we we don't want to encourage bad behavior I get it it's alright we just cut the broadcast no it definitely never had to do with any computer systems or financial institutions or anything really shit um I've never done a legal thing in my life and um no that's not true but certainly never caught yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** Even if I did do it, I didn't get caught, so it doesn't matter.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** It's fine.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** Yeah, it never happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** It was before I was 18, so let's just not talk about it.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:55]** Pretty sure my dad poured sand into large construction equipment when they were trying to build something in a place that he didn't want them to build.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Pretty sure that he did that with his friends.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** As a child?

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Yeah, as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** What age child are we talking about?

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Six years old?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** I don't know.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Ten?

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** No, come on.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Yeah, ten.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Almost a preteen.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** A pre-preteen.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** He was like that against the system that he was like, I'm going to dump sand into your tractor?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:15]** Wow.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** That's expensive, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Yeah.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** It's crazy.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:26]** What about our next kid whose name rhymes with... Bick Nelcher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** You really wanted to go with the dick, Dick Delker.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** You know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** This is a family show.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** All right.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:43]** So when I was about 10 or 12, I participated in space camp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** Cool.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** That's awesome.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** Like you flew to Texas or whatever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** No, no, no.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** They did it in... Oh, not like NASA space camp.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** We're talking NASA space camp.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:58]** So we're talking the one down close to...

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Oh, John, help me out.

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** Cape Canaveral.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Yeah, Cape Canaveral, yeah.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Oh, Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I forgot you're from Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Well, he's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** I forgot that, too.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Totally from Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Wow.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** John throwing shade on his fellow Floridian.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** I was born in it.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** I was raised in it.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Nick was not born in Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** What, Will?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Are you a Californian?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:27]** I think by virtue of being here for, you know, like 12 years now.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** You weren't born here.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** All right, well, I get your point.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** I get your point.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** Well, you don't need to rub my face in your cool In-N-Out burger.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Anyway.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** He's not a complete Californian.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** And your Huell Hauser.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** And you too, Kelly.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** And you too, Kev.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** We're outnumbered, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** There's no Florida's gold.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** That's sad.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** There's no Florida's gold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** No, there's just the Fountain of Youth in St.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Augustine.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** The Fountain of Life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Oh, okay.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Florida's riches.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** That's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Boca Raton.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Boca Raton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** There's cool stuff in Florida.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Yeah, dude, it's awesome.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** For those who are into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** Swamps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Swamps.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Yeah, swamps.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Gators.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** The Everglades.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** All right, Nick, so tell us about this base camp.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** What did you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:12]** I got to experience kind of like the gravity on the moon, which was pretty cool.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:16]** Got to do their G-Force machine where they spin you around in circles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Wait, rewind.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:20]** How did you get to experience gravity on the moon if you were on Earth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:25]** They had this cool gravitational machine in there where it gave you... They just turned off gravity.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Turn it down.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** It was weird.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** I don't know how they did it.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** 10 or 12 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:35]** It's the experience of reduced... Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** You're going to be that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Were there strings involved?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** I'm assuming there were like cables or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Probably like an arm.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Probably something like that.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** I haven't centered the arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** I got to do their jeep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** It probably gives you a wedgie, but you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I am jealous that you got to go to Spitskate.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Yeah, that's awesome.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I think that's really cool.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** That's super awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** That's really cool, yeah.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:07]** I got to do the G-Force machine where, you know, kind of on the Rocketman movie where he's literally going around in circles and the force is like pushing.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** A friend of ours going through flight school right now just did that.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** And he, I think he got up to like seven G's or ten G's.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Yeah, it's intense.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Yeah.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** And it's really intense.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** He looks so uncomfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yeah.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** I did.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** As a 10 or 12 year old, I did three G's.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:28]** And then I also got to fly the simulation of the space shuttle, which was really cool.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That's great.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** That was awesome.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:33]** That's like the best part for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:39]** I got all the way through separating the initial rocket boosters before we blew up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:52]** Nick, that is just enough experience to where if this was a movie, that would be foreshadowing that later we're going to be in that situation and you're the only one who can fly.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:56]** That's just enough experience to be watching it on TV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** And you're like, no, they need to push that button.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** That's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** There is.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** I watched the tomorrow war last night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Actually, I'm like halfway through that one.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** I still haven't gotten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** It's so freaking funny.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Good movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Chris Pratt, right?

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** Yeah.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Terribly funny.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:41]** I gotta check it out yeah decent movie like good amount of humor like suffused with like some really dark thriller stuff so glad they're a sponsor yep I love that they sent us all this cool swag yeah that we're all wearing I'm best friends with Chris Pratt yeah I'm pretty sure he listens to our show yeah pretty sure yeah he and The Rock hang out right it's fine yeah Kelly they work out together and he listens to yeah so that's how we found out about him I can see that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Constructing her own narrative.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Let's see.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:52]** I guess, like, there was one when my sister and I went to a school for a while together.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** And my sister, like, hated her curly hair.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:59]** So she would straighten it with, like, a straightener and get it, like, really long and straight and everything.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Okay.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:04]** And then there was this one kid who, I guess, like, wasn't at.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** And this is, like, he called her, like, Michael Jackson.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:22]** so now this is like after michael jackson was cool and before he was cool again you know what i mean so like it was like a period of time cool anymore yeah long wait wait dangerous oh yeah that's true actually he's always up and down

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** What which which ebbs and flows of Michael Jackson?

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** I don't know.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:39]** It was the 90s So then like it's like after Free Willy, but everybody started to get a little bit wise So then like so then I got like really mad So I just like pushed him and I like I think I pushed him like really far and he got hurt like really bad.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Oh

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:56]** because wait what what age were you most of my fighting was really young like not much older i don't know it was like third grade or fourth grade or something so you were you were like but you're still like five foot ten when all the other kids are there yeah exactly that's the thing well yeah

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:03]** Don't call my sister Michael Jackson, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** Being tall is fine one-on-one.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** But if, you know, you're being bullied or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** This is the 20 duck-sized elephants.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** It's just a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** It's more surface to hit.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** I wasn't bullied, though.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** I mean, he was just being a little bit of my sister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Yeah.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Oh.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** I never grew up with that guy for sure.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** No, I'm, I'm, I'm all for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** And I have taken on three other kids before when I, as a kid.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** So there was one or two times like that.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Stupid kids.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:33]** We're all, you know, wait, Kelly, are you trained in any, any kind of martial arts or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** Not really.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:42]** He's received training in Krav Maga.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** I did some Taekwondo for a period of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** So you can kick a bottle off my head.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:56]** I can just see Kelly, like 5'10", just roundhousing a third grader.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:00]** He's also a third grader, though, so it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** That's how this works.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:14]** I guess one more slightly unbelievable story, because it technically was about whether it's hard to believe, but related to Taekwondo, I went there and actually invited this sort of, I guess he's like a C-level celebrity these days, but his name is David Gallagher.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:20]** He was the blonde kid from 7th Heaven and the voice of Riku from Kingdom Hearts, which is what I most like him for.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** That's awesome.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** But there was a couple years where I hung out with him as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** You were like, I beat up Riku.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:35]** So I was briefly in an episode of 7th Heaven just for like a second, and it was like nothing.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:41]** Yeah, it was technically an extra part, an extra role, but they talked to David, pretended to be friends with him.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:48]** But then we did become friends for a while, and he tried to make me really cool, so we would, like, go to, like, these clubs and stuff, and everybody would be like, David, and get, like, VIP and everything.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** But I didn't end up becoming cool, unfortunately.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** But it was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** False.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Wait, at what age were you going to these clubs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Yeah.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** I was, like, probably 15, and he was, like, 17 or 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** So it's, like, 18 and under clubs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Nice.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** It was an 18 and under club.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I think it was called Club 17 or something.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** Classic.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** It used to be in Hollywood.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Of course it was.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:07]** But you are cool now because you're going to start another podcast.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** So that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:12]** I can just imagine Kellen going up to one of these clubs like, we're on the list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** We literally were.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:18]** And then there was like one girl from my high school once and she's like, can you let us in?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** He was like, nah, that girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Wow, amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:27]** And then we drank our Red Bulls or whatever teenagers do to be cool.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** Wow.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Anyway, story complete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Wow.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:38]** We have just a minute left because I want to play, but I'm sure that kids... We're still going to hear your stories, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** I was actually a pretty good kid.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** All I ever did was play video games, I think, for the most part.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:48]** It wasn't until seventh grade that I got bad, and I went through this little bad stage.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** But my bad was we popped up the keyboards...

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** And then we'd rearrange the letters on the keyboards.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** And so we'd spell out, fuck you, on the keyboard.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** But it was funny because it was a typing class.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** All these kids were messing up on typing.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** And the teacher was like, what do you mean?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Why can't you guys figure this out?

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** And she'd go look at the keyboard and the keyboard would say, fuck you.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** And then we stole the mouse balls.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Because they bounced really good.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:25]** If we have any young listeners, you probably don't even know what a mouse ball is, but before the invention of LED laser scan mouses, they used a ball, a roller ball, to actually move the mouse around and tell you where the cursor should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** It had a little wheel that it sat on top of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** And before the ball, it was just hard-rolled eggs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:49]** right yeah um but that those mouse the mouse balls are like just thick rubber and they bounce really good we lost a bunch of them we got in trouble so i actually got suspended for the first time in my life because that's pretty good that's a good reason good i have one that i can share that's related to that please and then we have to start

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** No, then we've got to tell John's stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** No, John, I want to hear yours.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** No, I'll talk about mine later, but it does involve martial arts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** Oh, stay tuned for after the show for John's stories.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Stay tuned after.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** But, Will, tell us your story.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** John's got the outro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:20]** Okay, so real quick, I installed a small virus on my computers in my high school at junior highs that would allow for... It was called mitten fingers, and so when you would type...

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:26]** It would, like, on, like, you know, the 10th or 12th letter, it would be, like, the one right next to it.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** Oh, my God.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** It was evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Describe that.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** That's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:45]** So you're, like, typing your essay in the computer lab, say, you know, like, the teacher's, like, assignment is to, you know, write two paragraphs about what you did today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** It was a random fat finger generator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** I love that.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** It was basically...

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:59]** Mitten fingers would occasionally, on a randomly determined interval, pretend like your keyboard finger hit the wrong key.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** You're typing like, hi, my name's Nick, and it'd be like, hi, my name's Bic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** That is awesome.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** That's actually well done.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** It's actually still implemented in the school system there.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I hope so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** But alas, I don't think it is.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** I just love the way you started it.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** You were like, all right, so you guys know the Pentagon, right?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** So I put in a virus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** I would never go against my own government.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:40]** Thank you for watching the morning rotation onto our next program.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** We'll save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:47]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** Let's play some Starfinder.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Is there anyone out there?

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** That's always stuck in my head.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Starfinder.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** Is there anyone who really cares?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** So

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Let's do a quick recap.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** All right.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Perhaps... Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** This is the second time you've interrupted me.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** I was listening back, and you interrupted me again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** I've been interrupting John a lot.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:25]** But, John, good job on the we'll save whatever you call this on Roll20, because I like the sliced, you know...

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** What's it called?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** Devil in a box.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** Yeah, the box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Devil in the box.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** It's called the devil in a box.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Out of the box.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, the landing page is, as we'll get to it, Rick's murderous destruction of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** It's called a devil, man.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** Consider this.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** That perhaps...

**[00:15:45 - 00:16:09]** as you entered into possibly one of the stranger rooms in this book so far maybe the fear that you felt from the intense two fight the part one part two fight with the gray bounder and also just the whole wing of maniacal experiments all that fear and anxiety maybe washes away

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** As you walk into a room that is ostensibly maybe a haven from all that.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:28]** An oasis of youth and innocence as there's plush toys and beads and baubles and a fusion fizz machine that when lit up is the only light in the room.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:33]** This artificial color sprayed across the floor and the wall.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:45]** So illuminated by this light, you do battle against this tiny Sheeran plush toy that has come to life.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** You insult.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** You shoot.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** You prod.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:58]** And ultimately, you are chopping into this toy, this cute toy, until it finally does some damage to Dr. Okay.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** Then here's...

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:08]** Feeling remorseful at destroying this caricature of his own race, you offer an olive branch of mercy.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:21]** And Rick, 19, cold and unforgiving, slams the creature against the wall, chops it in half, its arms outstretched as if it were going to accept.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** It's sharp, razor blade arms outreached as if it wants to hug you.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Yeah, come on, get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:38]** And the last sound that it makes before it crumbles into lifeless oblivion is the sound of, I love you, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:48]** Hello, darkness, my friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** Rick 19 is not persuaded by pleas of mercy.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** As the toy.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That's it.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Or love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Or love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** He's not persuaded by anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Slides against the wall.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** I'm going to move you guys over from our tongue-in-cheek landing page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:37]** two or rather i should say tongue on the floor body on the floor yeah let the bodies hit the floor we need that drop we should add that to our uh our drop list what's what's the name of our of our drop spreadsheet kev it's called uh not the drops we wanted the drops we needed it's not the drops you you needed but the drops you deserve yeah yeah that's great i forget now and one of the batman quote is you guys will catch me off guard


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** That's improv, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:47]** So, you don't even hear the sound of the toy as it falls just back into the pile of plush toys.

**[00:18:48 - 00:19:14]** that are there except now one is in half the rest don't move like this one did so now rick is standing against the wall dr k i think you were injured you're standing in the middle of the room nico you're standing next to the vending machine and here's is there correct so what do you guys want to do um here's is going to investigate this pile over here uh or the both of the piles

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Okay.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** Yes, I'd like to investigate as well.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** All right.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** So Dr. K hears.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:26]** You're going to start walking around looking at some of the piles that are, you know, some of them are crushed workstations.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:32]** And you're kicking through, again, little plastic beads and baubles and strings that were clearly made from something else.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** It's been destroyed.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** And Rick and Nico, what are you two doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:43]** Uh, Rick is going to look at the, there's three doors.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** There's one for the door we came into.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** It's a long room.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:52]** Um, there's so straight across, there's like an angular door, um, wall with his door.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:56]** And then to the right, there's two, there's a double door and then a single door.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:01]** So Rick is going to look at those three doors and just reminder, he does speak Aklo.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:10]** Um, so I'm going to roll perception check to see if I, I don't know, get any kind of information on what's behind each of these doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Okay, let's go through.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** I just want to see what each of you are doing and then we can go kind of and go through.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** So, Nico, what were you going to do?

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** I was going to loot the place.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** Okay, so you're also going around.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** So that's fine.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** So why don't we start with Dr. Okay and Here's.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** I have 17.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** 17.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** Ooh, I rolled an 18.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:35]** 18.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Wow, you just had to show up here like that.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Watch out because I'll beat you up.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** I'll push you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:45]** Into this pile of plush toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Into the pile of plush toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** This pile of plush toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:51 - 00:21:02]** So, I think Dr. O'Kane here, since you're over in the eastern part of the room, you do find something that looks...

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:31]** kind of odd I want both of you to actually give me a either engineering or mysticism check and as you're doing this I'll tell you I'll do mysticism you basically pick up this weird tangle of wires and crystal and it seems to be some sort of a device you're not quite sure what it is you can't quite make it out because it has little appendages sticking off of it and you're not quite sure what it is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** I got a 29.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** I rolled a 26 mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** 29, 26.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Yeah.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:42]** So as you're holding it, maybe just some part of it looked more whole than the rest of everything else around it.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:47]** And as you pick it up, you realize that has some sort of a leather on it.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:53]** And the rest is a metal brace that acts as the superstructure for this because it's a glove.

**[00:21:53 - 00:22:00]** And so the metal covers the back of the hand, and the leather is more of the inside, these metal fingers.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:15]** And as you put your hand into it and turn it over, maybe here's with your three fingers and Dr. O'Kays, you guys hold it up, you realize that it has a space in the back for what would be a spell gem.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:20]** And you do see this red kind of...

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:40]** misfigured gem that's sitting inside of it is it like damaged it's not damaged and maybe that's why dr okay you saw it too you saw that bit of red and you're like that's more brilliant than any other plastic you know weird thing here so instead you realize this is called an eldra carna

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:53]** It has these bright hues that you brush off the fingers and you realize that each of the fingers have these lines, these stripes in them that are purple and yellow and gold and vibrant green.

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:00]** And it is a device that is worn like a glove and you wire in a spell gem.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:05]** This spell gem is a spell gem of Magic Missile.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:12]** And it basically allows you to use the device as if it were a weapon with a spell thrower fusion.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:17]** So you can throw out your hand, cast whatever spell is in the spell gem.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:25]** And when you put it on, you are proficient with it for the purpose of using that.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** There are...

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:33]** You have magic missiles, don't you, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I do have magic missiles.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** There are other spells you can plug in there, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:41]** Yeah, and as you look, there are actually four others, Doctor.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** You notice that same vibrant color.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** Maybe one is pink, one is green.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** There are four other spells.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:56]** There's caustic conversion, microbot assault, overheat, and supercharged weapon.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:02]** And I don't know if you guys want to put this in our new little behind the scenes.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:06]** We have a new group equipment sheet.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** We can put that there.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** I can put that in later if you want.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** But that's what you find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** What is the name of the glove?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Eldra Carnum.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:26]** As a non-magic user, I am enticed by such a device, but I haven't the courage to wield it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Ah, perhaps.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Yeah, Doctor, okay.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** I don't know.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** What do you think?

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:43]** Well, I do have experience with these spells, and it's my role, so if you don't want it, I'll take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:50]** I mean, would it be of any use, tactically, to have multiple magic users or...

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** Are you guys talking loud enough for the others to hear?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** No.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** No.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** Oh, maybe not.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** Kelly's like, no, definitely no.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Isolate the competition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:13]** If I had the ability to hear what you were saying, I would suggest that possibly Nico would take the glove and give him the ability to use such magic.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** But I can't hear what you're saying.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** And he turns back around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** Are you guys on a different comm frequency?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Maybe, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:43]** we could share it i i think that'd be fair we could pass it around from time to time i mean it would be like if if you ran out of spells this lets you use one extra spell slot or how does how does it work i mean for here here's wise it yeah because he'll he'll run out of spells just because of the way spells work um but yeah like you don't need to be a caster to use it at all you

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** And I think like each gem has so many charges.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Yeah.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** How many about, John?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Per gem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Per gem?

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Great question.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** That I don't know the answer to.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Oh, it's based off each gem.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Yeah.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Like each spell gem is.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Yeah.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** And you found each of these spell gems laying there?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** Yes.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Damn, that's a big find.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** I can't spell Algecara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** How many gems?

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:06]** It's phonetic.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** Which is, funnily enough, not phonetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Yeah, how do you spell it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** P-H-O-E-N-E-T-S-E.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Wait, what?

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** You're talking about finesse.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** Yeah, I was just messing with you.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Thanks, John.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** But we've got that drop, right?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Sure, sure.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** I can cue that up.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** I found it.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** I guess I'll cue you if you really need to.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** There it is.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Thank you for that.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** I appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:34 - 00:27:02]** it's you got you basically have like the infinity yeah it's pretty neat that's exactly what i'm thinking i i don't know like i i really like it but um i'd understand if other people want to use it so it's cool yeah i think i think like you are a spellcaster you have all these abilities already it'd be better if somebody non-spellcaster used it so like i'll take it no i'm just kidding i don't i think i think nico should take it if anything


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:09]** I got enough tricks and stuff up my sleeves without doing the magic missile stuff.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Okay, I'll take it.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** I'm more along the lines of I just need better... I'll take it.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:19]** If something comes along that improves decks, I'm appreciative of strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** That's the way it's going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** What does Microbot Assault do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:27]** Yeah, show me all... Can I get a sheet on all these?

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** It's all in the core book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** It's better.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Sorry, man.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Got a game to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** Can I get the item in my thing and then all the other things?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Yeah.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** Isn't that going to be in my... Thanks, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** It should be in the Hero Lab.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** Can we jump over to Nico?

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:58]** So you're looking around trying to see what you can scrounge.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:20]** you see basically that there are a bunch of wires some semi-precious stones not as brilliant as the spell gems were and some other random crystals you can gather that all up takes about 10 minutes overall weighs about five bulk worth about 2500 upbs for crafting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:29]** Okay, so Nico's going to call out to the rest of the group and he's going to say, guys, I found a lot here.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** It's going to be pretty heavy for me to carry alone.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** Does anybody have any spare kind of room to carry this along with me?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** Because at the moment, this is going to encumber me.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** I'm going to be slowed down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Not anymore.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:48]** I have the Stormhammer, or Piers has the Stormhammer, and I'm full up pretty much at this point.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Uh, same.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Unfortunately.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** What is it that you found?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** I found crafting materials.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:04]** This is stuff that'll be useful in the long run when we're trying to makeshift a crafting device where we might be able to find some way to signal for help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** I have no interest in crafting anything until we get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:12]** This might be our only way off of wherever we're at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:17]** How is this stuff going to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:32]** Back at Orion Industries, I was able to come up with many a different technology that would be able to boost communications and weapon ranges to extensive lengths.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:40]** And Nico's going to roll a diplomacy check on everybody here just to kind of use his sales tactics here a little bit.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** What are you trying to do?

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** He's trying to convince us to carry E. Convince him to carry E. All right.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** And convince him that he knows what he's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** I'm going to say it feels like a DC.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** They seem, one, that they're already holding a lot.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** So I think a DC.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** I mean, I know you're really good at diplomacy.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** Wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:05]** Do we literally have to beat something to not carry something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** He has to beat it to try to convince us to kill him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** No, I know, but even then, that doesn't make sense.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** You don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** You should do what you want to.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:21]** I just wanted to give him a DC that would tell him whether he feels like he succeeded or not, and then you guys can roll with that however you want.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** I can tell you fails with Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** All right, well, it's DC 18.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** DC 18, I think, is a good number.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Fair point.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** To feel like you were confident.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** To feel like you sold it as best you could.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** I don't want to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** Natural 20 plus 9.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** I don't think that means that they'll do it.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** It doesn't guarantee that they're going to do it.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** But you sold it the best you could.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** That's what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:57]** He's so cunning and so salesman-y with his, you know, one sentence asking me to carry all this bulk that I still can't carry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:06]** If one person can carry one, if one person can carry, if the three of you guys can carry one bulk a piece, that would be more than enough.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** That would put me encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** I think it would put me encumbered too.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** There's like literally no room left in anyone's pockets to carry things without getting encumbered.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** You also already have a lot, Nico.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** You are very convincing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** You should craft a little baggage and then pull it behind you with all the stuff in it.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** Like a red rider, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** Did you find any wheels in there?

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** You also find... Nico?

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Fifteen of those.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** You count them up.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:42]** There are fifteen of those bug furry friend dolls.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** Those...

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** Each one can sell for about 10 credits, you think.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** They're kind of rare, because remember, they have the rare authentic Skittermander fur.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Voluntary, of course.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:56]** And if you were to find a collector, you could probably get 25 credits for each of them.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** You also find 32 sealed...

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:27]** fusion fizz cans all across the flavors of like leovara lush get a rocket blast all that stuff right and each one is only worth one credit but they provide you all the nutrition and moisture that you would need for the day so if you guys wanted to crack a cold one you could just feel like you weren't going to be exhausted i know you've got your culinary synthesizers but this is also an easy way to make sure that you don't drift into the exhausted or like the

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:32]** I forget what it is, but not eating and not drinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** But that's not even a mechanic that we're using, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:45]** If that's the case, John, then Nico is going to carry two bulk of the five bulk that you've suggested, and he wants to take the most valuable parts that he finds.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:48]** And if you want me to roll an engineering check on this, I'm more than willing to do so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** The total is going to be the same.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** So it's going to be about 500 UPBs.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:57]** So taking two bulk means that you're going to have 1,000 UPBs to either sell or use for crafting.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** All right.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:19]** that's fine here's what if you guys said i'm not going to eat or drink anything then i would be like great i'm going to roll that in i'm assuming that you guys have kind of said like you had these culinary synthesizers i'm not gonna unless you want to talk about and bring it up when when and if you rest and you're using it right then otherwise i'm going to assume that you're doing it

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Yeah, that's what I thought too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** We're just taking care of our daily needs.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Use the bathroom when we need stuff like that.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Yeah.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Yeah.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:33]** I'm going to take a 10-minute rest to use the bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Here's going to go pee.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** BRB.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:40]** Rick, you were going to look at the doors, right?

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** What's your percent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Yeah, I rolled an 11.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** On all three doors?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** Or should I do one for each door so I have a better chance of winning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Which one do you want to start with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** The one all the way to the left.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Okay.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** The straight ahead angled... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** You know that door and the door to the right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** The two single doors.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:08]** Both of those are different than other doors.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:15]** One, there's a bright stripe of alternating purple and black that outlines the exterior, right?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:24]** There are also four large toggle switches, two on each side that can lock the door from this side.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** But they're not locked from what you can tell right now.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** They don't seem like they would be in a typical conventional locked position.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:39]** And in the one that is on the left, there is a view screen.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:49]** You can't see much inside, except you can see that there is some sort of... It's a bit of a smaller door.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** It's maybe about three feet off the ground.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** You kind of look in.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** You can see that it is...

**[00:34:53 - 00:35:09]** a room the lights are flashing there just seem to be some sort of damage workstations there's some more damage inside you maybe see in the back there looks to be a couple shapes of large pedestals you're not quite sure what's going on there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** This is like a digital view screen or it's just like glassy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Glass.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Okay.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:24]** And the thing is that above it is some sort of creature of like a holographic image that's floating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Vroom, vroom, vroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:53]** right of the stylized biped with broad spiked shoulders and an armored head and a long tail and maybe dr okay you know what this is and i'm putting this in your journal now i'm allowing you guys to see it it's called the kyokor and it is a some sort of just creature it's a little odd that it's so that it's there i'm gonna see if i can show it on screen here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:13]** it's got like a dragon's face kind of yeah and like just big broad spiky shoulders like you said um this is but this is a hologram right so totally hologram if you want is it moving or is it like solid is it or like static it's static but the hologram still right it's it's projecting it

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** But it's not like a video feed or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Uh-uh.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Two of the things that I want to remind you guys of.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:27]** One, in this room, already, there is... There are green stains.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** across the room, kind of splattered.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** You're not sure what they are yet.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** And, Rick, if we want to investigate that in a second, we can.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:46]** Rick, I want to let you know that you can give me, if you want to know more about this hologram, you can give me a culture or a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** I don't think I have life science...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** I'll do culture.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** I'll assist with culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** I got a 20 for culture.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Did you assist?

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** I did.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** So I got 22 for culture.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Right?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** 22?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** It's plus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Yeah, plus two.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** 22.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Great.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** Yeah, you were... You're like, this has to be something with the greys.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** But it seems weird.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Like, I don't...

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** I'm looking in.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** I don't see anything there.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** You know, Kyogres are like big creatures.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** I don't know that that's quite what is in there.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** It seems odd.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:23]** And Dr. O'Kay is like, maybe it's not meant to be in there.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:29]** You realize that it's like a gray thought figure.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:34]** It's like a symbol that's meant to indicate this area's importance as a place of study.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:41]** So the actual sigil, the actual symbol of it is unimportant and probably unrelated.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:46]** But it's so unique that you could refer to it.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** And somebody would know what you're talking about without maybe knowing what you're talking about.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** It's like a monster crafting lab or something.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Maybe.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Maybe.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** Also could be totally unrelated because then you look over to the door to your right.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** Same door, four toggle switches, purple, black outline.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** The view screen is damaged.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** You can't see in there.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** The glass is cracked.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** There's another hologram, though.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:17]** And that hologram is of an aquatic creature, which is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:23]** Wait, you're saying these are like gray study rooms that are marked by these holograms?

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:30]** So like you would, one gray would communicate to another gray, like, oh, I'm in the football playing lizard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:44]** room sure and then another one might say oh i'm in i'm showing it to you guys now the dolphin well it's this like prehistoric creature with electricity i just added it it's called an oma they're these large creatures that are pretty cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** It's like a fishy whale with electricity.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Yeah.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Purple and blue.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** It looks pretty awesome.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Yeah.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** It's freaking cool.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** It's an OMA.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** Like a giant koi, electric koi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Yeah.

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:02]** And maybe here's as you're walking over, you do feel kind of a telepathic.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:30]** connection to them in the sense that they there is a there's a telepathic imprint on them so it's like you could refer to them telepathically right it's like saying you're you're you're saying i'm in the room with the oma or doing whatever or you could you could ping it kind of telepathically okay yeah but not the other figure right just this one both okay um now here's keeps it a secret


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:52]** does Rick see another door over there at all is it is it just like a single room which one either like they both seem like they're the again the one on the right you can't really see into it that much but maybe you can look and see they're both pretty large rooms

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Uh, and so Rick, Rick's like sensitive.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Are you doing the telepathically?

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Yeah.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:01]** Here's, here's, it's going to be like, so he feels like here's like scratching at his brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:16]** This, uh, these little figures, you can kind of like, there's some way of talking to them or using them to like tell other, probably other grays, you know, and they're telepathically where I'm at, what it does, stuff like that.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** I can't be sure, but it's related to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Understood.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** Do you think these rooms are worth exploring then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:37]** uh is there any way here's could find out some sort of like remnants or imprints telepathically of that kind of stuff um i i'm not quite sure i'm not gonna say no so maybe give me a i'm trying to think what that would be

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:59]** mysticism sure this is good i'll assist okay uh well i only rolled a nine unfortunately in spite of my high mysticism it's basically one you rolled a nine yeah i did assist one plus eight so it's 11 you got an 11 that's just good enough to know i'll i'll say this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:11]** They both seem like you are... The space that you're in now, the workstations were probably some sort of area, again, where you could do testing.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** You're probably in another testing area in general.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** The experiments here are just different.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** But the room that has the Kyokur on it... Mm-hmm.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:30]** You do think that there is probably... Wait, how do you spell kill care?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:36]** I just tried to spell it and Google Docs corrected it as kill care.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Kill care is apparently a word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** What is a kill care?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** I don't know.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** I'm going to Google it.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** I'm afraid to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Kyokor is K-Y-L-K-O-R.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Wait.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** I'm so bad at spelling stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:58]** K-Y... So, you can't get too much read from the room with the Kyokor.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:20]** but the room maybe you start to reach out and dr okay is maybe i don't know maybe he's saying like he's talking to you about just some different ways that you could picture this he's also trying to picture what's going on uh-huh makes sense the one with the oma not only

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:25]** Is there a telepathic ping from something inside the room?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** It feels like maybe there's a working computer in there.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** It's not been smashed.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** If you remember, in the first room with the bounder, there was some sort of a communications device.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:42:38 - 00:43:01]** you think that from your ping there's probably another one in there and it might be working but you're but it doesn't feel like it's like a huge thing it just feels like there's something in there that can communicate to somewhere else okay two things uh first how do you spell what was the other creature called oma o-m-a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Okay, that's an easy one.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** And secondly, Killcare is a beach in Australia.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** For anybody else.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** We love our fans.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Remember, I'm not going to do that.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Down Under, we love you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** But if you live in Australia, you've been there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** I want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** I've been to Australia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Wait, what, Will?

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Nothing, I just really want to go to Tassie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Yeah, me too.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Yeah?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Is that like an island with the Tasmanian devils?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** But they're extinct now.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** It is, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** Tasmania is a little island on the south side of Australia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Sounds fun.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** All right, let's go to Australia, guys.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** We'll save tours.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Coming to you soon.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Yeah, they have some conventions there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** They do.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** They have conventions in Australia, yes.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** I think Gen Con had one or something, or PAX, or I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** PAX, yeah, yeah, PAX.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** PAX.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Be cool to go to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Here's Tells the Group this, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** There's a computer in there, and I think it's another experiment laboratory.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:02]** We should probably check out the computer, but heads up, maybe next a paperclip will attack us or something.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** I don't know.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** Literally anything's game at this point.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Freaking heads up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** You had some thoughts, Nico?

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:14]** So Nico wanted to do a culture check on the Keogh course.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:20]** Roll your... So that's a 14 on the dice plus 10.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** That's 24.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:26]** He wants to know a little bit more on the ferocity of the Kyokors.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Okay.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:34]** There's something in the back of his head that he remembers something about them destroying the population of an entire planet.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Is John feeding you this, or did you Google something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:44]** Let's not go in the Kyokuro room, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** Kyokuros are colossal, by the way.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Like, size.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** Like, technical, mechanical size, colossal.

**[00:44:51 - 00:45:02]** I'm going to read you some of the Alien Archive, which you can see, because the artwork is super cool, and it's a super sweet thread in general.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:12]** It says Kyokurs are one of the most common types of colossi that rampage like a living apocalypse across the ruined planet Daimalko.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:21]** These mammoth bipedal alien horrors are large enough to take out an entire city block with a few sweeps of their hulking claws.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:28]** And in fact, this seems to be exactly what they evolved or were designed to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** It's Godzilla.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** I saw an image of it just now.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** It's basically Godzilla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Yeah, I was thinking that.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** It is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** Just going to pull out some cool phrases.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Enormous juggernauts.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Let's see.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:47]** Tiny glowing eyes peeking out from a cavernous gash.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Ooh, I like this.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:54]** It's also said that Kyokurs are capable of speech, but that no one alive has heard a Kyokur's voice.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** It's haunting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:02]** So, Nico Ryan is just... Upon remembering all this, he's gonna say...

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** I've got a bad feeling about this.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** You said it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** He's going to charge in first with his jump jets ready to go.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Here I go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** And he's going to follow up saying like, they're experimenting with Kyokors.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:17]** Have you ever, you guys heard about the awakening on Daimalko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Why does Nikko know so much?

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** But go ahead, Nikko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:21]** No, I never heard of it.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:27]** I heard stories during my tales on the Outer Rim and in the near worlds.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:36]** Just... The planet used to be full of life and had a vast and teeming ocean, and all of a sudden, in a single day, it all evaporated.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:48]** And these Kyokors, part of the Colossi, rose from the ground, and in the course of a single year...

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:55]** drove the entire population underground and nearly destroyed every living thing on the planet.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:02]** If they're experimenting with Kyokors, this thing might be bursting from the inside.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** It is just a hologram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** Which represents something else, though, right?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** I mean, this hologram is like a symbol for a larger thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** What do we find in the other room, though?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** The place was slashed up.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** The place was slashed up, and the structural integrity of the room itself was failing.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** That appeared to be a troll of some sort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Yeah, the Colossus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** I think we should still investigate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** There were, like, green slimes all over that room, too.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** There's green slimes in there, right, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Yeah, tell us more about the green stains in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yeah.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** Give me...

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** I don't know why I started really high with that.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:50]** Give me a, give me somebody a life science or medicine check and give yourself a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** I will assist on the medicine.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** I'll assist on the medicine check too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** I did not assist on the medicine check.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** So who's going to roll it?

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:04]** I rolled it for a 29.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** 29.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Who is assisting?

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** I'm assisting.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Let's go one at a time.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Nick, are you assisting?

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** Yes, I rolled a 10 cumulatively.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Okay, great.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** So plus two.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Rick, are you assisting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** I tried, and I had no luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Okay, so you don't know anything.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Dr. Okay, I'm just assuming you're an assistant.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Because you're a baller.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Or I could have just rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** I did roll a net.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** 18 for 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Hell yeah.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:35]** So both you and here's at the same time are like, this is absolutely troll blood.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:45]** And Dr. Okay, I think it's your assist gives you this information, which is that the blood is slightly radioactive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** Hey, guys, this isn't just some normal troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:56]** This guy's a little, how should I say it, radioactive.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** I don't know.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** He's beaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** That's good.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** Let's not go in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** Where was the stand at?

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** It's just all over the room?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Yeah, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** That's just all over the room.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** It has nothing to do with these doors.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** It's just all over the room that you are already in.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** What?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** Oh, hey.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** This is bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** It's slightly radioactive.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:26]** As a former ELT, I can tell you slight radiation is not a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** Is there any mechanical aspect of the slight radiation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** No.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:35]** No, but just the fact that there is a radioactive troll doesn't concern you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** The fact that this building is collapsing and we've been contained in a vessel.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Yeah, let's get out of here.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Exactly.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** But we may have to encounter this radioactive troll at some point as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:50]** I think we should start with the room with the computer in it, which is this one.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** The one on the right.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** The OMA.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Yeah.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** The OMA.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** We might be able to find our way out that way.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:01]** Plus, we can connect to whatever network they have going on and figure that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** I concur.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** But, John, did I learn anything about the double doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** The double doors, there are no view screens in them.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** they, you presume, probably just go on to another wing.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** Think of the double doors that were in the data foundry, right?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** They probably just lead up to another area.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** So, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** Are you guys ready to move forward?

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Ready.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** And Rick will step up to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** To which door?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Yep.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Going through this door.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Oma?

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Not this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Into Oma's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** Guys, let's let Chad open it up, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:43]** That room was the Kira Core, which is the giant... Kira Core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Oh, yes.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:55]** That was not the room that... The other room was the one that you pinged a working computer with, like, a telepathic... There's, like, a telepathic sense that you get from that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** All right.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Let's do it.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:59]** Chad, if you all agree, Chad's going to go open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Okay.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Rick will stand there.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:10]** He's got his artillery laser out and he's leaning up against the double doors so he can sense if there's anything coming from that side as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Okay.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:15]** He just drinks a purple soda and tells Chad to open the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:21]** The Grape Fanta is probably a joke, but there was a Grape Fusion Fizz and there was no cool name because Grape is just Grape.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** So there's no cool name for that one.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** It's just Grape.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** It's refreshing enough.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** As you walk out,

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:35]** you also, there's a faint ping of something else telepathic.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** And right at that time, Chad's like, no, right.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Great.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Uh, great.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** This is on gray.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:48]** Chad opens the door, presses the buttons.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Chad is around for what?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** An hour.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** Yeah.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** He's like around for an hour for each cast.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Okay, cool.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Takes a bite of the burrito.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** Takes a sip as well.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Hurry up, Chad.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Choose.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Come on.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Thanks, Matt.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Checking the surf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Chad.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Chad, open it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** And then looks at you.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** And then.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** All right, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** And then opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** God, Lord, Chad's so slow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Does he even watch Saturday Night Live?

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** I mean.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** It's Pete, what's his name?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Pete Davidson.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:23]** Pete Davidson does like a Chad character.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Amazing.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** Where he just always is like, okay.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** And just does stupid things.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** All right, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** Okay.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** I mean, Chad's not that dumb.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** He's smart.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** He's just kind of like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** He's a floating hand that does the same thing repeatedly until you tell him to do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** He does what I ask him to do very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** He's loyal, is what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** This door slides up.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** And as it slides up, it doesn't quite get all the way up.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:59]** There's probably something blocking in the cavity above.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:13]** but as it opens you feel just a bit of cool air as if this door has not been opened for a little while i'm gonna reveal it and this is what you guys see

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** It's a large room.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:23]** You see in the northern wall, the first thing that grabs your attention in this large room is there's a giant plate of blue metal.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:31]** And it displays an animated Oma that just like on the outside of the door, except much larger.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** And it's swimming in the blue screen, occasionally looking as if looking in the room again.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:41]** and its purple-blue electricity kind of cackles across.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** But there are dead patches in the screen from random damage, so it breaks your immersion.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:55]** As soon as you see the electricity and the fish swim through one, you realize this is just a large visual prop.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:58]** So then at the southern end of the room, you see a podium.

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** It's covered.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** There's a bunch of colored buttons and touchpads.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:11]** Near the eastern wall, there's a frame of gold and silver wires that reminds you of the one that was in the room with the founder.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:15]** Silver wires, there's hollows built into it like small cages.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:22]** And all these wires run into a machine in each of the cage where there's like a smoky crystal.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:31]** And there are two workstations, each with three desks and chairs that sit in the center and the northern part of the room.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:43]** And in the northern west corner is this raised section of tubes and wires and vapor clouded pipes, the whole array humming tsss.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** humming and occasionally hissing.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** And the ceiling cracked.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** Twisted metal panels bending down into the room.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** Rock and debris litters the floor.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:59]** The one thing that it stands out

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:21]** is in the center of the room there's a strange gold object in front of the two workstations seem to be two spiky rings that are almost touching each one you can just tell the lights flicker a little over but each time it does there's a ping there's like a reflection from this bunch of multicolored gems inside

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:28]** And you see these spider-like limbs and spikes sit from a soft blue orb in the center of the object.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** And these spider-like limbs kind of come out from underneath.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Some of the limbs look like they're for movement.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:41]** Other ones appear to be covered in syringes, little clamps, little handy tools, maybe like a little tube.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** Just looks like a weird little helper.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** It's not moving, just kind of sitting.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** What do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:54]** Um, here's, I'll send Chad in to investigate that thing in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Okay.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:00]** And Rick will proceed for any traps or, or item or hidden objects.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** That's 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:12]** Uh, can I do a mysticism check now with the door open to see if I can like kind of pinpoint where this psychic thing was coming from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Yeah.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** But since you don't have telepathy, it's going to be a bit tougher.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** Okay.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** Well, here's... Well, I can use... Yeah.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Yeah.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Here's... Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:26]** Sorry, Will, go ahead.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:26]** Go ahead, Will.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:34]** No, I'm just... I can only do mysticism in the sense that I can also do a life science...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:35 - 00:57:02]** check but i don't know that i'm skilled in mysticism because of that it was just for identifying creatures and like the regular life science stuff sorry what did you say you said that the workstation there's two workstations then there's the object in the middle of the room and then did you tell us what this thing to the far left is or straight across the room the far these three objects that is this machine it's humming there's a lot of hissing right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:07]** This blue thing is part of the screen.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:15]** It sticks out a little bit and it is essentially another large area where it can come into this hologram and swim in and then swim out.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** It's pretty neat.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:21]** This is a podium where you think that probably you can control the computers.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** This is that machine.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** Sorry, this communication.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:29]** Sorry, this is the machine with the smoky crystals reminds you of the communication machine.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** This is the hissing machine in the corner.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** You can give me an engineering check on that.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** This is the podium where you can control and there's probably the computer.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Here's you can ping.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:43]** Does the hissing machine look like the communication device from the other room?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Okay.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** No.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** The one in the corner looks like it might have been of a similar make.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Hears wants to do a couple things.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** First, what, like, Dr. O.K.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** was trying to do.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:56]** Hears is going to try to identify the source of the telepathy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** Okay.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:02]** So... And, Rick, you did a perception check that you don't... Rick is standing right in the doorway.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** You don't notice any traps.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** There are no traps.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:07]** What you do realize is that...

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:11]** There are also four toggles on this side, so you could lock the door from this side.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:16]** And you realize that you could also lock the door from the outside by pulling these toggles.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** So you could lock it from inside or outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** So we'll do 26 mysticism.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** 26 mysticism.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** And then he's also going to detect magic before sending Chad in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Detect magic.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Okay.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Yeah.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** And Dr. K, you were going to do the mysticism as well.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:34]** I can't actually do any sort of mysticism check.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:47]** I can only identify creatures that would normally be identified by a mysticism check using my life science ability because of my pious scientist Asharu granted option.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:48 - 00:59:07]** i'll say that you can assist here's though if you want sure i assist i think i get automatic success great so here's you got 28 okay yeah let's see so you're doing detect magic and you're trying to just see where the source of this telepathy was right yeah those two different things yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Okay.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:18]** One, the main source of telepathy seems to come from... One, the computer seems like it has that telepathic component.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** You can interact with it telepathically, right?

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:31]** You also sense that the machine in the corner, the communications device, is also some sort of telepathic device.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** And you get the sense that...

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:39]** you need to take a minute to work through it, probably through the computer.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** That's probably the best way to interact with it.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:46]** It seems pretty complex, but you can ping it, and I'm picturing kind of like radar.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** You can feel its presence.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:55]** You do feel a telepathic presence, almost a sentience coming from the object that's in the center of the room.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:00]** It seems neutral, but dormant, which is weird.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** And, yeah, go ahead.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** No, go ahead.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** I was just going to say your detect magic.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Yes, detect magic.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** If you're a GM and you know this room and you know stuff, let me know.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:16]** I don't think you really pull up anything with your detect magic per se.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** There's nothing.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:21]** If anything, there's more of a psychic telepathic presence than there's anything really...

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:37]** Although you do think that some of your, maybe your detect magic is blending in a little bit with your telepathy and this object in the center of the room has some sort of magic in it in the way that many hybrid items do, right?

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Could we do like an engineering job?

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** You could do an engineering check on that.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** You could also do an engineering check.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:47]** I know you were curious, Rick, about the machine in the corner, the one that's humming and hissing.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** Identify technology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:55]** At this point, Rick is still just concerned about anything that is a risk to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** Kind of jump out and kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** Yeah, so I see damaged stuff.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** Is there any indication, or is that just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:24]** flavor on the map uh the it doesn't seem like anything in here has the same like there's no green stains right there's probably none of this other blood seems like whatever this this room is a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:54]** you know there are some beams that are hanging down and some of the workstation stuff are damaged but it's not as bad and so that northern wall is like one giant screen and then like there's one section of it that's holographic where the thing can come out and swim around yeah and then otherwise it swims into the screen it's kind of a neat thing that's all and I'll only move 20 feet at a time but Rick Rick will strafe the wall keeping his gun up and like scanning the room as he makes his way over towards the pedestal okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:58]** And Dr. O'Kate, you were going to do a detect magic or sorry.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** Engineering identify technology.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** Okay.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** On the thing in the center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** I got a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** So 29 total.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** Okay.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** 27.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** 29 total.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:16]** Just look at something real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:16]** Okay.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Yeah, that's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:30]** It's probably some sort of a technological and magical creature, but it's in a dormant state.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:35]** And the telepathic ping you get from it, the profile of it.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** Is neutral.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:42]** And that doesn't seem to be just because it's in a dormant state.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:49]** It just seems to be like, even if something was sleeping and was maybe evil, I'm not saying detect alignment.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]** It's just, you, you have a sense that there's nothing here that is, uh,

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:57]** malicious about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** Okay.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** He just wants to send Chad in to go, like, touch it.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Okay.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** So Chad does that.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** He goes, like... All right.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Goes, like, right up to it.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** Okay.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** Touches it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** Rick, as you're coming up to the podium, give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:10]** Oh, God.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** This scares me.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Tiny Kraken dice.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** 15 plus... Tiny Kraken dice.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** Engineering is a 3, so I got 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** 18.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** You think...

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:30]** that this area is a laboratory because that humming and hissing machine you realize is an energy and heat sink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:37]** So... I think that this room is a laboratory because this device in the corner must be some kind of heat sink.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** He says over the intercoms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:42]** Yeah, it's pulling in all this excess energy, right?

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** So that way nothing concentrates in one area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** It's not damaged.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:50]** I'd like to do an engineering check on this item up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** Sorry, I'm not looking at the map.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:58]** The other corner?

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Did you walk in the room?

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Sorry.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** Yes.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** Okay.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** Dr. Care walked in the room, and you're walking up to, oh, the northwest corner.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]** So that is, you are pretty sure, some sort of a comms device.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** But again, you don't have telepathy.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]** So you're not feeling that comms connection.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:18]** But based on the way that the wires move out of the room.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:22]** Is telepathy different than any magic mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** It's often a racial trait, telepathy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:25]** Yeah, you're a telepathy.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** So here's a Nico.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** You're both standing outside the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:35]** Well, here's, it's going to go to the computer and try to ask it some questions and connect with the telepathically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Okay.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** And Rick is at the computer.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Nico's running.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:44]** Uh, Nico's going to not run and Nico's going to walk in and, um,

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:52]** He's just going to kind of be looking around and just trying to understand the scene that's kind of beforehand a little bit.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** Okay.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** It's definitely not something.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]** It's definitely something that unnerves him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Okay.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:04]** Hears, as you walk in and you're walking forward, are you two at the podium, Rick and Hears?

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:05]** Yes.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Okay.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Yes.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Okay.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:13]** So you realize that the podium is a working computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:18]** Yeah, here's just going to connect with it telepathically and touch it and stuff.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Yeah.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Telepathetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** Rick will take point in front of it.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** Yeah, and Nico's going to go up to the computer, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Okay.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** He's going to try to figure out.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** He's going to ask some things to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** So you guys are spreading across the room, and I realize that we need... Monsters!

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** No.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:38]** We need something for chat.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** Because we don't have anything for Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:41]** Something from Chad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:43]** What do you mean?

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:45]** A token for Chad?

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:47]** We need a Chad token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:53]** Wait, it's a guy on a surfboard with a gun?

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** Yeah, it came in 1977.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:55]** Why not?

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Where did you get this token from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** Just the depths of Roll20.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:02]** Okay.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** Annals of Roll20.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** He searched for Chad in Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** So chatty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** It's very chatty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** It is pretty chatty, man.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** You know what it's all about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:21]** So Chad walks up and Chad is... Chad doesn't seem to... Chad just keeps eating burrito and doesn't seem to have any... I don't know, man.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** It's not moving.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:30]** The blue ball, though, Chad tells you seems to be like some sort of like a plasma ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** You know?

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:37]** But it's not on yet, so there's like a blue energy coming out of it.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** I don't know, man.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** It's rad.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Can Chad do that?

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** Chad has some surprising things that you don't know about.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:44]** He doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** Chad's a man of the world.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Thanks, Chad.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:53]** Chad did major in some kind of physics, so there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Before he died?

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Became your servant thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:00]** It's a long story, Chad and I. Did you see Santa Barbara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** Exactly.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** That's exactly where he went, actually.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** The University of Castro Bell, Santa Barbara.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** That's what it is.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** So here's you connect to the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:16]** Nico's also going to be going with yours to kind of connect with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** Okay.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:18]** Hey.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** Move over.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** You guys hold hands while you're connecting?

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** That's the only way.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:23]** I can relate to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** That's the only way.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:27]** Nico's going to go, I have a bad feeling about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** Nico's going to go over to Harrison.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:33]** He's going to be like, all right, I'll let you take point on this, but if you f*** up, I'm taking over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:37]** You literally can't even do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** That's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Give it a try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Give it a try.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** Give it a try.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:41]** All right.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Here's his connected to it.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:46]** And he puts his like finger on Nico's head so he can hear what he's hearing.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** Okay.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Okay.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** A couple of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:49]** I like that.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** Like ET, you know.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:54]** One.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** You.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:57]** Two.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:01]** I need you to give me a. No.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:05]** Okay.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** A computer's check.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** Okay.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:08]** Sorry.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** Let me tell you this.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** It is a secure computer.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:15]** So you're going to need to make a DC if you want to see what's in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:17]** Pull up your hacking flowchart.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** John, do you want to do... We talked about this earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]** Do you want to do the new... I don't want to do the dynamic hacking yet.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:25]** That's a thing for another time.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** That's cool, and it's really great.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Thank you, Tech Revolution.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** I don't want to do that now.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Trust me.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:30]** It's cool.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** What is dynamic hacking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** You've got to read Tech Revolution.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** So...

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:42]** Actually, as you go to tap in, you think it's probably going to be a bit tough.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:45]** So I don't know if you want to give me a hack right now.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** A hack?

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Or just a computer's check?

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** What do you mean?

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:53]** To get past just a hack into the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** John, can I make a suggestion?

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]** Hold on.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:05]** Before we do this, seeing as though he's touching my forehead telepathically, so I hear what the computer's hearing and what he's hearing.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]** Right?

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]** Yeah.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:14]** Can I make the suggestion that he do a diversionary – make a diversion so that he can hack in there and I can roll that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** I don't understand.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** No, I think you would just assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** I just assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** That's just how that works.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:28]** Well, I have a plus 11 computer, so I think we're about the same, Nico and I. Well, Rick is going to move away from the computer if you guys are going to start hacking into us.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:28]** Okay.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Yes.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** Okay.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** Free.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** Okay.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:30]** I rolled a 27.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** Crushed it.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** And I'm assisting.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:33]** Yep.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:36]** So... Yep, that's an assist.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:40]** That's... Even with a roll, that's a 4 plus 11.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:40]** That's 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:45]** I mean, you can see, too, that the computer, like...

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:48]** And you don't have to do it telepathically.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** You can also type in.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:52]** But the telepathic way is just very common to it.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:55]** But for some reason, this one has some tactile buttons to it.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** Okay, so you crush it.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** You are able to get in.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:02]** Your mind pushes past whatever security is already in the computer.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:06]** You can actually get in past the login, past all of that.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:13]** You see that there are three modules here.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:16]** That are on the computer.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:34]** As you do that, as you're opening yourself up to the computer here, the presence of that thing in the center of the room awakens as well.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** Of course it does.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:47]** And Chad is looking at it, and Rick, you're standing over, and Dr. O'Keefe, both of you are flanking the creature from diagonally away, like in separate corners of the room.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:51]** The wheels, you hear...

**[01:10:51 - 01:11:01]** These gold wheels start to turn and they're catching more of the light and they're starting to reflect all these colors all around the floor around it.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:11]** And the blue, the blue light inside of it starts to glow and connect outside.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:35]** to the rings and so it seems like it's coursing electricity through it and it pushes itself up on these four arms that come out it pushes itself up and all of you in the room hear in your mind you simultaneously hear this voice that says


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:38]** Greetings, new test subjects.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:42]** I am the Monitor, and today is your lucky day.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:47]** I had a bad feeling about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:51]** It reminded me of that thing from Halo, the little floating guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** Not Cortana, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:59]** No, not Cortana, the guy who has knowledge of the ring and he's screwing you over secretly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** Screwing you over secretly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** Yeah, the little floating guy.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** I can't remember his name.
