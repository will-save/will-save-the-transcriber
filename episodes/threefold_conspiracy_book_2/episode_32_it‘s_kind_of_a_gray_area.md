## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:10]** After the group had opened the door, they quickly found themselves in the trappings of a decontamination chamber.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:17]** Seeking another way out through the opposite door, the group worked together to shut down the decontamination protocols.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:25]** Niko, frustrated, tried his dueling sword to smash his way through the decontamination turbines.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:33]** while Hears cleverly figured out how to trick the decontamination protocols into opening the door for our companions.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:36]** What they found on the other side, though, was troubling.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:42]** After encountering some toxic gas, they found three dead bodies.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** Who were these dead bodies?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:46]** How did they get here?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:49]** Have you guys ever been in that moment where you're like, man, I really want to go to sleep.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:59]** But then there's some other thing that's like, but do I weigh sleep against this thing?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** All the time.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** What's that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:08]** I don't think it's ever had that dramatic of a... You make it sound like, oh my god, I have to weigh these options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:12]** It's normally like... Every night is a battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:18]** No, well, I mean, we can look back at school and be like, oh, I have a deadline tomorrow that I need to stay up for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Seriously, though.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** That's about right, though.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** I think, like, John certainly stays up late for Will Save stuff.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Yeah, true.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** I can totally see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** That's happened before.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** That's happened many times.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** I've caught myself late at night doing other things.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Doing things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Other than sleep.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** That's so bad.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Other than sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** What's so good is that that could be anything.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** It could be releasing a bunch of balloons at the beach.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Texas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:48]** Making his own hydrogen collider, which is probably what I expect Will is up to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Working on a cow's own oven.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Taping a boom mic to a table.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Taping a boom mic to a table.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** He's pretty good at that.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** He could be doing that all night, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:59]** It looked like it was clamped and... It's all kinds of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** It's clamped, taped, and zip-tied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** I mean...

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:11]** At the end of the day, at nighttime is when my mind starts thinking about all the other stuff I need to do, so I will usually do something before I go to bed.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** I only go to bed until late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** I've caught myself up at four in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** I used to stay up all night playing video games.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:29]** If I was playing a video game, I could stay up playing it until two or three in the morning and be like, oh wait, I probably should go to sleep at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Yeah, I would do that too, but just wouldn't go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** And then you're like, oh, is that the sun?

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** I can't do that anymore.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I've definitely done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** I can't do it these days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I can't do it these days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** I probably still could because you just get distracted.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** I get so focused on the game.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** But I will say that I read.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** So that's my new thing.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** I go to bed early because I'm an old man.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** But then I try to turn off my phone and set it down.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** And then I'll read through a book.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:01]** And I try to get through at least five, ten pages without falling asleep.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Which isn't good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** I usually make it to halfway through one page.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** When I start that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** Bright daylight, standing up, half a page puts me to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** Nick, you've been conspicuously quiet this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Is there something you're not telling us?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** Fun fact, I'm a very high energy person.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** What?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** No.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** No way.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** No way.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Stop it.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** Stop it.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** Don't lie.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** So you guys must think that I've just, I got to be going all the time, right?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** All the time.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** All the time.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** False.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** False.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** False.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** I am either up or I am asleep.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** That's true.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** And I will go to bed at 1030.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** And if someone tries, wait, yeah, good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** So you sleep so much that you have so much energy the rest of the time.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** I've seen you almost asleep one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:56]** Yeah, there was one time that we were playing Star Wars Battlefront II.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** on, you know, like Xbox Live.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** And no joke, he's like, yeah, so I think I'm going to go over here.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** And then it just stops.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** And then I was like, uh, what?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** And then I finished the match, like 10 minutes.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** And then he's like, oh, hey, sorry, I fell asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** Just in the middle of the match, just like sitting at his couch.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** And he still won.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** He still won.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** He still got a higher score than me, of course.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** I fell asleep playing a first person shooter.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Let that sink in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** That's really impressive.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** Hey, so do you guys want to ask?

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** You guys are in this weird space.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:39]** You guys come in and your characters have gone through.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** You've gone through what seems to be some sort of space where you are.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** You know, decontaminated.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:50]** You go into some sort of lab hub where there are computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Little computers.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** They were little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Everything's like small, little.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** And I got to ask.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** Is everything like small or is everything short?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Because there's a difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** There is.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:09]** It's mostly short, but also on the smaller side, like three-fourth scale, maybe, let's call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** What fantasy, like a gnome-sized thing?

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** Sure.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Yes.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** But here's the thing.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** What are you guys at?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** There are two things I want to ask.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** One is, where are you guys at health-wise?

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** I'm good.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:27]** Because you've had a couple... Why do you ask, John?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Not all of you are good.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** You guys are taking damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** I need to know how badly I need to mess you guys up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** I think you guys took some damage fighting those robots at the top.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** I don't recall any of that.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** Some of you took some damage from the noxious air, a.k.a.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Nico.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Not me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Hold on, let me speak with my attorney here.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** I do not recall.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** That was a visual gag for everybody watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** Yeah, he turned to Kelly.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** I can barely see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:05]** As Nick's attorney, I'd like to not... Anything sort of visual doesn't apply to this case.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** It's just audio.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** All right?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** But the point is that...

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** Not all of you are at full health, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** I mean, I'm not at full health.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** No, no, but you're good.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Correction.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:23]** I'm at full health, but my stamina is not at 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** That must be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** And that's why I have Kelly as my lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** I do want to talk about this.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:40]** The whole use of stamina is actually compared to other unnamed TTRPGs.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:46]** I actually kind of like the idea of the stamina versus hit points and health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Star Wars has that.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** They got soak.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** Soak.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** Yeah.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** That's the term.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** It's like the armor.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Yeah.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** As the armor breaks down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Just how well can you take a hit?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Cool.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** Thanks for that Star Wars moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:03]** John is just foreshadowing and giving some space for me to say, yeah, I'm reading the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Will, especially, you're welcome.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** I'm looking at Will.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** I'm just...

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** I'm so happy to be talking about Star Wars.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** Let's just move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** Let's just talk about Revenge of the Sith.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Question number two.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:27]** Has anyone been thinking about what Professor Benjam said in that very last moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** When he was singing?

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** Well, sort of half singing.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** My heart will never go home.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** What did he say, pray tell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** My heart will never come...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I get what you're going with this.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** That was pretty good.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Go on.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Yeah.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** He sort of whispered that in his dying breath.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:46]** I mean, certainly.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** Here's thinks, well, obviously, he's probably a pirate.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:56]** B, he might have been involved in some way, being that he didn't reveal that to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:03]** Or he was just a robotic plant that was feeding off of our energies, because it's all just a simulation.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Nothing's real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** That's possible.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** I think Benjam was real.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** I hope so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:15]** What if I told you that everything that has existed up until this point in time

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** A simulation created by the Matrix.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, I'd say at this point I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** I caught on to that.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** That's exactly what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** All right.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** All right.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:35]** So we're in this room, and we have full health, and...

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Hold on.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:36]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** We are low on health, so that way he doesn't try to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Why do you ask that?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** Is it leading into what's going to happen right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:45]** And I say that perjuring myself before the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** There's something that I want to say.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** I want you guys to take a minute.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Let my words kind of sink in.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** Okay.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:05]** The formal dining room of the Sugesta has a commanding view of the sizable hull of the luxury star cruiser.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:26]** Multicolor light streams through the large bay window into the private space, bouncing off the dark castravillian wood table and reflecting from the white radiant walls, lighting up the faces of three individuals sitting around the table.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:33]** none of whom seem at all interested in the radiant drift spiraling just outside.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:39]** We see first a Shirin, face inscrutable.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:47]** Their demeanor in their luxurious robes is scientific and studious, eyes opaque, mouth neutral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** There's more than you're letting on, Marcus.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** What are you not telling us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:01]** Marcus's human fingers turn a small glass of a dark liquor in his hands.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:09]** His matching dark Absalom business fashion hinting at the quality of liquor in the glass.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:14]** His eyes finally look over to the colorful drift outside as he says,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Just drop it, Zenka.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** It's nothing concerning this.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Now, where will we come?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** He says as he downs the glass, looking at the Kasathan authority.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:36]** I believe we had just established that your line of work isn't always above the board of the directorate, Marcus, the captain says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** Neither does yours, Captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** Well, now, it's rude to insult an honest living.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:52]** Running the finest star cruiser where distinguished individuals such as yourself come to play means we need the best security aboard to back that up.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:59]** If I'm to ship a haul as large as you need, Zanker, I'll need the assurance of Marcus and his droids here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:06]** If I'm the one paying, I'm the one deciding, Zanker says with a flat tone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:13]** The captain quickly raises one of his upper hands in a gesture to his ear, indicating an interruption through his comm device.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:24]** Zanka and Marcus, it appears the two of you are needed in the upper dining area immediately and stands up, his right two hands inviting towards the door.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:30]** We'll finish this later, Marcus says, placing the glass gently on the table.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:35]** If we finish at all, Zanka directs back at him, walking out.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:41]** The white door slides open into a lavishly finished hallway.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:48]** The ambient light seems to come from everywhere at once, bouncing off of the clean, smooth look of the walls.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:58]** The pristine floor reflects gently as side running lights of many colors, reminiscent of the drift, guide the passengers and captain across the ship.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** And for a minute, all they hear are the footsteps of each other.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:11]** until they step up to the door of the upper dining hall, the cafeteria reserved for the luxury suite members.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:24]** The doors open into the sounds of young boys shouting and scenes of food flying, making the same pristine walls, marking them with reds, yellows, and greens from all kinds of food.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:37]** A few rows of tables and booths separate the adults from two young human boys and one young Sharon male, all ducking, bobbing, and weaving around the mid-air food.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** Boys, Marcus and Zanka say at the same time.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** The two look at each other.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** The laughing stops, the silent punctuated by several rolls hitting the nearby table.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Marcus continues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:58]** Gentlemen, I expect that for as much fun as you're having, that you'll be here tomorrow morning to help clean it up.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Looking at the captain and winking.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:08]** Plus the inconvenience of having to close the place, so perhaps helping to serve breakfast as well.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Yes, I think that's a great idea, Marcus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Good, good plan.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** The captain says as the immediate protests come from all the children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Wait, no, no, but I can't.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** No, no, we're not going to do that.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** No, no.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** ZZ, no, but what about the flight deck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:34]** We hear the voice of the young Sheeran as we watch him run down the aisle, one shoe leaving a strange blue liquid mark on the floor, squelching with every other step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:46]** While the flight deck will still be there, the crew needs to eat to make sure you don't fly off into the drift, Zanka says as she gently glides towards the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:54]** She and Marcus lock eyes and give each other a small, knowing smile and nod.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** We see the door open to somewhere new, a small bedroom of dark wood floors.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** The warm light of the drift streaming through a tinted shade and the spread of fresh new sheets on a bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** No hairy hollow vid tonight, you know.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** You'll need sleep to get up early.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** ZZ, I won't fall asleep without it.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** You know this.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:28]** Zenka pauses for a moment, considering, then says, I'll tell you something instead, my sweet.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:41]** When I have too much on my mind, I bring up a picture of the stars outside or look out at colors in the drift and try to count each one by one.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** You'll be surprised how many you can find.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Now, good night.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** And leaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:51]** The light from the main suite beyond the door fades as the door closes.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:58]** And he's left watching the play of colors just outside the ship.

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Red.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Deeper red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** Purple.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Yellow.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Blue.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Red again.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** White.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Red.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Blue.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** White.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Why isn't that white...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:43]** moving he sits up and looks closer it it just hangs like a distant lamp bulb green blue red no no that white is still there he sighs slumps downs turns and stares ahead and tries to close his eyes he's frustrated i i just want harry hollow fit i can't sleep now without it he thinks he looks the white light outside is gone of course


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:52]** He turns his head to close his eyes and sees a small, faint reflection of the drift in his open closet.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** Two reflections, actually.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** Close enough together to be reflecting off of eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:09]** Clear enough to be two completely black eyes staring at him from his closet.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** A voice pierces his thoughts, answering him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** Yes, you can sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:32]** And we come back to the lab hub that you guys are in.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** Let me move you guys over to roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** Was that a vision of what was here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Who could say?

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** That was creepy, that last part.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I'm definitely unnerved.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Yeah, me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Good.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** That was intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Yeah, that was.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** It was good storytelling, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Thanks.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:54]** Wait, so, I mean, John, close your ears.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** This is like private talk time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** You could also just message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:01]** I just want to kind of like dissect what we just heard.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Go ahead.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** I'm going to reconnect to Roll20 and take out my headphones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** So there were three people sitting on a Star Dreamer, well, on a Starliner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** But that's not what he called it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** He called it a different ship.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Did he say the name?

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** I didn't hear him say the name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Yeah.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** John said the name.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** It started with an S. It's the...

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Sugesta.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Sugesta, that's right.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** He never told us that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:31]** But so there were three people sitting in the dining room of the Sugesta looking out at the drift.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** One of them, I'm assuming, is Captain Rameem.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** I think it's just another captain.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** Mostly because the voice sounded like Captain Rameem.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** Unless it's just how all cathartic sounds are going to sound.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** But they call him Captain as well, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:54]** True, but I would be reticent to connect anything that we've done to the previous simulation that we've had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** No, but that's the thing.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:09]** So it was this Marcus is human, and then the Sheeran, I didn't catch the Sheeran's name, but this human and the Sheeran are talking to a Kasathan quote-unquote Captain about some kind of business deal.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:18]** Which would possibly be convincing people to get on a ship to bring them into a simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** Perhaps Kevin, but I think we took the red pill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Well, they were talking about a game, right?

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** There was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** One guy who... Do you guys want me to read that part again?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Yeah, please.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Yeah, John's recreating Saw now.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Yeah.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** Let the games begin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Let the games begin.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** Should I just read that whole part real quick?

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Yeah, if you please.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Uh, yeah, sure.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** There's more than you're letting on, Marcus.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** What are you not telling us?

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:53]** We see Marcus twisting a drink, and he says, Just drop it, Zenka.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** It's nothing concerning this.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Now, where were we, Captain?

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** Downs the drink, looks at the Kasathan.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:05]** Kasathan says, I believe we had just established that your line of work isn't always above the board of the Directorate, Marcus.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Neither does yours, Captain.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Well, now it's rude to insult an honest living.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:19]** Running the finest star cruiser where distinguished individuals such as yourself come to play means we need the best security aboard to back that up.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:28]** And if I'm to ship a haul as large as you need, Zenka, I'll need the assurance of Marcus and his droids here.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** That's pretty much... Oh, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** Hold on.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** I think... Hold on.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** I got a theory here.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** It's Westworld.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:41]** It's a little bit of Westworld combined with a little bit of the Matrix, Kev.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** I'm with you a little bit more now.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** So what I think is happening is the following.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:54]** I think maybe possibly Captain Ramin is the ultimate bad guy here.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** If not the ultimate, the semi-ultimate bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** And... Well, Ramin's just the workhorse.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** He's the one delivering these people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:08]** Yeah, well, I mean... He's not necessarily the messenger either, though.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** He's... Yeah.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** We definitely shoot this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** Well, he's already dead, from what we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** So, for all we know, I think it's a simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** And then these one or two other individuals.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:26]** I don't know what's real or what's fantasy, which it's all fantasy technically because it's a game.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:31]** We're playing a game inside of a game now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Inside of a game.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:37]** Those other two guys are like the game masters or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** The greatest game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** I feel like there's this old classic.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** What was that?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:55]** If you guys can remember the name of this classic book, but there was this old aristocrat that was an insane piece of work.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** He would actually give people a choice, and he would hunt people in real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** The greatest game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Yeah, the greatest game.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Thank you, John.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** The Greatest Game.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** He would hunt people, and he would hunt them, have them run away.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** If they escape, they escape for good.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** You're okay.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** But he would hunt them, and that's kind of where I feel worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** That's what it sounds like to me, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** And then there was the modern retelling of The Greatest Game in the hit musical Rent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** That's what that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** I haven't seen that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** I haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** I was like, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** I don't call that part of Rent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** There was that

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** comedy movie where that guy would hunt people.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** I forget who starred in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** It just came out though.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** There's hundreds of movies about hunting people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** I wouldn't say hundreds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** There's a lot of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** This is a big theme apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** You guys want to jump back in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** We're hunting people now?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Are we being hunted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** I feel like they paid to play.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:58]** Will gestured towards me as if I'm supposed to answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** Well, you did ask questions about my health, personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Yeah, let's roll persuasion on John.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Roll persuasion on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** And John has to roll deception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Yeah, maybe roll deception here.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I only rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I was kidding, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** Will is going to hear a lab looking curious.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** I am going to go, dude.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** Is it diplomacy or culture or bluff?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Diplomacy.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** 16.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** 20 for Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Wow, that's pretty good.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** So you guys are in this lab pub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** This dark space where the room... I don't think John did very well, and he's just ignoring the rules.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** ...is destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** I don't even... The room is destroyed.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:44]** We have Nico and Rick are standing outside in this small double-doored vestibule.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:49]** is inside, and if you recall, last time Nico runs in...

**[00:23:49 - 00:24:19]** finds this noxious air starts to take damage runs out hears seeing the blue light at the other end of this dark dark room the only light source runs in touches the control panel is able to turn on some sort of fan and then the air gets sucked out takes a deep breath and then looks down and sees three bodies motionless surrounding him near the

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** panel.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:24]** One seems to be lying against the panel.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:27]** One's right behind him sitting in a chair and the other one's on the other side of the panel.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Here's what he do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** I have a question about comms.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** I have a comm unit in my inventory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:50]** Do we have headsets in our... I think when you guys first, let's call it landed, moved in in these escape pods, you established communications with each other, right?

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Maybe.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:57]** Because you all made roles in order to make sure that you were able to communicate because you couldn't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:24]** touch any like nothing in the escape pod would respond to your command so you're like let me see if i can you know make sure that my comm unit is still working connect well that's my part of my question is because i'm reading on the comm unit stuff and like it says comm units function of comm units that function system-wide so there are certain comm units that do um it also says that it includes a calculator or flashlight on this room it's a side entertainment options

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:33]** A personal comm unit has a function as same other devices by spending credits equal to 110% of the additional device spread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** So are you going to play Minesweeper?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Of course.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Will, I didn't mean to cut you off.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** I just wanted to have, like, just talk one at a time.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** You were saying something?

**[00:25:43 - 00:26:05]** uh because you're standing in the back so i just don't remember rolling perception as i came into this room i feel like it was very abrupt when i came in you guys were in initiative order when as soon as nico went in you guys were like boom trying to figure this out and here's i think had a pretty high role and was just like you know what i'm going in wait let's rewind just a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:33]** nico walked into the room when nobody else was ready and so we were all like wait what's he doing and then of course he starts choking to death uh and we all backed up very quickly to save ourselves yeah so that's where we're at um so yeah rick will say in the comms like great job over there here's what what else do you see in there yeah here's is about to like telepathically do this anyway but since we have comms that's that's awesome so here's respawns


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** I find three bodies.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:42]** I don't know if they're dead or if they're... I kind of worry that they're undead.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** I hope they're dead.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** I'm going to check it out.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** I'll let you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:51]** Because fun fact, Kelly, the player, hates undead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** Yeah, zombies is like the one real fear that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Zombies freak me out too.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Will, don't capitalize on that at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** Yeah, don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:03]** Never.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** What kind of bodies do you see?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** Do you need our assistance?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Should we approach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** No, I stay there, seriously.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** And he's going to look at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:25]** And at the same time, Rick's going to walk forward and kind of step behind one of these desks with his artillery laser up and point him kind of in that direction, ready to defend him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** Nico's going to walk in behind Dr. O.K.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:34]** and Rick, dueling sword out and azimuth laser pistol drawn in different hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:47]** So, if you can picture it, dear listener, they are on the other side of the room behind a similar panel, but that's partially destroyed with debris around it.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Short panel.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** Here's is at the other short panel.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Yeah.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** So, here's...

**[00:27:52 - 00:28:02]** So, yeah, you couldn't really make out the light is, you know, it's still like the light from the screen seems to be pretty steady, especially now that you've set everything up.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** But the light at the other end of the room is, you know, flickering.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** So you can't really tell what the bodies are.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** You just see their general shape.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** So do you go up to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** But you can use your comms unit as a flashlight.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You want to turn on your flashlight?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:21]** It increases the level up to one step up to 15 foot cone.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:25]** Not that I need to do it because I have regular vision and dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Got it.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:34]** Here's just going to try first to make out what kind of race they are, what age they are, stuff like that.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** And make sure that they're truly dead.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** Before he does a flashlight because he doesn't want to trigger something.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** And then if that doesn't work, he'll use a flashlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Okay, so you get up to it.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Yeah, make a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** I will assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Because that's actually how you wake zombies.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** Can someone help me check out?

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Shining lights in their eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Like what these things are and if they're alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** So how does that work between Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** and Hears?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Hears just said what he did.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** I think I can see an outline from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Hears rolled a 23.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** Let me commune with Yara Esa and age you.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Yara Esa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:33]** all right so here's like relays what he's seen like the shape of their face their expression he looks for slight movements to see if they're breathing or whatever and you roll to 23 23 and then guys you assist which i just imagine as i'm reading it it's like here's your you're kind of saying something sounds familiar sounds familiar so this is what you see because as you get closer and closer i don't want to get closer

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** I don't want to get closer at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** But I do.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** I need to find out.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:40]** I just kind of lean in very carefully.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** Super careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Hold my breath.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:56]** So the thing is that you see these thin bodies that appear to be smaller than your average humanoid.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** Closer maybe to like a Yosuke or a human child.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** They're face down.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:20]** You know, on the ground, one's leaning into the console, so you can't see their face, but you can see that there's a large hole that exits the back of their heads.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:32]** And maybe as you kind of try and get a better angle, you look over to the one at your left, you see that they have this gray-blue skin, this patchwork with deep burns.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:44]** You kind of look at their limbs, and they have five fingers, five toes, but each digit is long and slender, much longer than a human.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:48]** And because you rolled well, you know that

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:59]** The burns probably come from that same caustic vapor.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:24]** except something much more potent some like caustic materials that were much more potent than any vapor that was in the room and i can tell you a bit more about the hole but i want to know a bit i think you're going to need to get a little closer if you want to see what their face looks like or anything else about them here's so here's what what is your status

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:45]** what are they they're dead and they're small and they have long fingers and each all three of them have five fingers yeah five five fingers from their feet you can tell you know five toes but they're just small creatures oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Rick is going to start approaching.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** Is this area clear?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Can he just climb over the rubble?

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:58]** He's going to walk to the left and kind of along the wall down this long, lengthy room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** As you're walking down the lengthy room, you notice that

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** because there's a door on either side, right?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:13]** And the door that you're in front of on, let's call it the bottom side, there is rubble in that five kind of foot radius right around it.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:19]** There's enough rubble blocking the door that for now, mechanically, it doesn't matter.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** You can like get over the rubble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** So the door itself is blocked as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** The door is blocked.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:31]** You guys could try and see later about what you want to do about that.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** But the door right now is somewhat blocked.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Are we still in an mission?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** We're not in an mission.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** You're not.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** We don't have enough stars to open the next door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:50]** Here's is going to look at their faces, but before he does, he's going to say to Doctor, okay, hey, Doctor, can you tell me more about how they died and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:50 - 00:33:15]** i could we could attempt perhaps if i got closer so you come closer it's safe come on over to cautiously move up where are these bodies if you look right there they're in like a triangle around here's here's a look here i'll ping him he's gonna check out the one uh behind this right opposite the screen here or is it here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** I'll roll a medicine check on one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Okay.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** You want to aid?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Yeah, is it medicine or?

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:33]** Well, so you can do medicine or life science, but the thing is that you pretty much just see the same thing he does, this hole in the back of the head, but you haven't pulled them up to see what their face looks like.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** I'll do a, I'll get up at very close.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Okay.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Okay.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** 19 on the medicine check.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** You know... Doctor, okay, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** 19 plus 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** An outrageous amount.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** 34.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** So, I'll say this.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:57]** You know that the hole comes from...

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** A cortex bomb.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** Oh, man.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:12]** Just this cybernetic augmentation that prevents interrogation after, you know, capture, after being self-destructed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** Well, that or somebody liquidated them from afar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:21]** Well, I mean, like, they, quote-unquote, they, like, whoever's in charge of this whole thing...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:34]** is is self-destructing the the simulation like you also know that if anybody were to cast like speak with dead wouldn't work because of this cortex bomb

**[00:34:35 - 00:35:01]** does anybody have any ball bearings for brains because you as your characters would know this i'm trying to make sure like because there are like magic components to things or physical components i'm trying to make sure that you know but i wouldn't be able to perform any sort of magic per se yeah not strong magic users i mean like here's for sure but like you know on the room then it's pretty much just you okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:05]** Here's just going to look at the face of the one opposite the screen.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Okay.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** I'm going to investigate these computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah, I'll work on that with you.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Okay, let's do this one by one.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:17]** So, Rick19, you got 24 for perception?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Yep.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** Okay, and then Nico and Dr.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** O.K., you kind of just start looking over the computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Yes.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** And here, did you say that you were rolling perception or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** Um, if I need to, to look at their face, then I will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Got it.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** Okay.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:45]** So maybe Dr. Okay, you're about to turn away as here's is like, all right, I'm just gonna reach over and try and push their body, move them over.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:57]** And as you touch them, the skin feels like rubber kind of, but like just a bunch of rubber, like neoprene, like you just push into it and it just kind of sinks fake and then comes back.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Not fake.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Just feels necessarily maybe just like rubber.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** It feels like skin of something.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:10]** And when you do and you push it, the body rolls over, flops back, doesn't move or anything.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:21]** But it's at that point that you're struck by two large black opaque eyes staring at you open.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:28]** Small slits act as nostrils above a small, thin mouth.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:39]** And you realize, once they flop back, that their heads are bulbous and pretty large for their small, wiry frame.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:46]** And Dr. O'Kate, just something about this is like, I... I...

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** I didn't think it was this, but it is this.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** This is what they look like on Roll20.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** They're called greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Yeah, thought so.

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:06]** So they look like your stereotypical 1940s alien.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Roswell.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** They're small, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:28]** they're small there's like a great a small gray is it alive or just we're seeing it doesn't move it doesn't do anything you would think that it was dead um i don't i don't you should click yeah okay hmm can i do a culture check on them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** All results pull up independently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Ooh, I am rolling well tonight.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** I got a 19 plus 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** 19 plus 2 is 21.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:45]** The information on the greys in the Infosphere is incredibly scarce.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** Scarce.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Scarce.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** Scarce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Scarce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Scarce.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** I think I'm going to name a future NPC Scarce.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Yay!

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** It sounds like that.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** But... Scarce.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** As you guys are thinking about it... Scarce.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Scarce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Scarce.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Scarce.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** Scarce.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** This is a podcast.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Imagination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** This is a podcast.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** So think about this.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** The information on them is scarce.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:27]** And while you can't necessarily connect to the infosphere right now, it does seem odd because maybe in the past when you're like, I just looked him up.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** They're just nothing.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** And the pack worlds and beyond is so connected.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:44]** Like you can find out a lot of information very quickly until you remember that maybe you heard it, maybe you read it once and then you could never find it again, which is weird.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:51]** But any information about them once posted almost immediately removed within minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** Really?

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** But I will also say this.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:10]** Because you rolled pretty well, Rick, you know another thing, and that is that they're well known for probably the most nightmarish thing ever.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:25]** is that they take and abduct victims, perform strange, unknown medical procedures on them, and, like, only a few people actively remember what happened, but...

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:32]** The rest have to go through some sort of like deep form of like hypnotic therapy to uncover these like nightmarish things.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:37]** And sometimes people just wake up and they have a mark.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:48]** Sometimes they remember like just the sense of like cold calculating feeling wash over them as they might be, you know, naked on a table or something.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** And then that's all that they remember.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** And then they wake up.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:55]** And these accounts, again, are few and far between.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:55 - 00:40:00]** This room that we're in is like the control room for the simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** And if you've ever seen the X-Files, that's how I'm feeling right now.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** It's like X-Files.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** I mean, this means like the Starfinder universe is our universe, maybe.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Indeed.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** Not really, but they have our grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** There's overlap.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** There's overlap.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** So there are three gray bodies.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:26]** Here, there's a door to the north, and there's a door partially obscured by rubble to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** I'd like to closely examine their bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** I'm unnerved by this.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** I mean, we are standing in the control room.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** What does Rick19 say?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Well, Rick, I don't know.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Kevin's talking first.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** We're standing in the control room of the simulation that we just broke out of, essentially.

**[00:40:46 - 00:41:05]** um and it's run by greys who looks like i don't know my perception does my perception look as if like this room was destroyed through like self-destructive means or great question great question give me um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Engineering.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** Or if you have physical science, you could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Wait, do you want all of us to roll for that or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** If you guys want to, that's fine.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** But I feel like Rick19 was the one who had that question.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Also, let's not forget, Nico, you wanted to go look at the computers.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:24]** So maybe you're hearing all this as you're starting to go to the computers, yeah?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Yeah.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Okay, so we'll get to that in a minute.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Sorry, Rick, go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Okay, so you want me to roll engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Yeah, roll engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** Oh, I got 16 for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** That is, spoiler, just exactly what you needed.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Yes!

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:47]** You can tell that the damage here, likely caused by...

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:55]** some sort of bombardment rather than like a direct assault, like in the room.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:07]** And as that, as you realize that once again, the ground like kind of shakes, maybe a couple of rocks fall again.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** Everything seems a little unstable.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:17]** Hughes is going to help Nico check out the computer and see if we can find any other information about what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** And Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** I initially, like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Dr. OK initially wanted to do it.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** Nico, I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:32]** I did initially want to look at the computers, but now I'm actually really intrigued by these grays, and I want to investigate them more, but I don't want to sidetrack it.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** So we should just do the computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** We can do that in a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Okay.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** One more question about the rubble stuff.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:43]** Is the rubble by the door, does it look like it's falling from the roof, or is that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:57]** Yeah, the rubble by the door looks like it's somewhat from the roof, maybe a couple things from the wall, but it just seems like all over there are beams that support some sort of structure have fallen, and then a lot of rock has fallen as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** But you can't, like, see anything past the ceiling or the wall, right?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Like, you can't, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:07]** There's only two doors, one to the north and one to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** And then the double doors that you all came in behind you.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:15]** So then Rick is going to come and like casually start clearing off this rubble here.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Okay.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** But he's keeping his hand on his rifle and an eye on the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** Okay, so there's a lot there.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:28]** So if you're going to keep one hand, like, full with your rifle... He's just kind of wasting time at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:29]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** Okay, so you just start doing it.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** That's fine.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** That's fine.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** And as you do this, Dr.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:39]** O.K., you... Sorry, Nico and Hears, you guys go up to the computer.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** You guys are like, all right, Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** is looking down at these bodies, trying to put things together...

**[00:43:45 - 00:44:10]** pull from his like recollection you start hearing the sounds of rick 19 just trying to kick some things aside and the two you go up and you look at each other and you look down at this computer and you're like all right uh this is like the only thing that we have here to try and figure out some more stuff so why don't you give me a well first you go up you try and like do do do

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Try and go into it.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:27]** And when you use it at first, maybe you're baffled because some of those similar symbols that you saw on the escape pods and maybe some of the doors, but they're different now, those are flashing.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** And you realize that you can't quite get in.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** But maybe give me a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** I rolled a 25.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** They were ready to roll that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Yeah, they were like, 26.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** 26?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** I got a 16.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:44]** So who is doing the, like?

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** He will do it.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** I'll aid.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Here's going.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Dr. K is aiding.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Nico's aiding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** I mean, I succeed on the aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** Okay, so that's a 29, right?

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:12]** damn good job as as you start to kind of touch like and it starts to respond each time that you press something maybe something lights up that's red and then you press it and then something's green and the more that you do it the more that i want to look at these bodies while it's happening

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Everything.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** That's fine.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Everything here is kind of zones out.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:23]** You like your brain is just filled suddenly with the computer.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:30]** It feels a little bit like you can intuit in your mind's eye how to work the computer.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:35]** And you realize that like less and less do you need your your fingers and you can kind of almost think that.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:40]** And even though you can't read the symbols, it's like you suddenly just know what they mean.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** And it seems like it's just a property of the computer.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** That's just how the computer works.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** It can kind of like telepathically kind of move into your mind.

**[00:45:51 - 00:46:05]** You see, as you go through, on there are four secure data modules.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:36]** there's one that seems to be have something to do with some sort of like they all in general seem to have to do with some sort of testing or rather three of them seem like they're some sort of testing you this is where the limit of your understanding because you're not quite there although what language do you speak um one second i speak uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:53]** abyssal celestial common draconic Aoxian Kasatha Shirin Yusuke Dr. Oki speaks Akloian or Aklo Dr. Oki speaks Aklo this is good Rick also speaks Aklo but he's kicking rocks

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** He's kicking rocks.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:04]** You see one that, so once maybe Dr. K is like looking and saying words and kind of sounding them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** Yeah, no, no, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** That's good.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** You kind of pick it up.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** You're like, oh, one.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** One of these is on testing.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Huzzah.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** It seems to be some sort of weapon.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** One of them seems to be on some sort of frequency testing.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** One of them seems to be some sort of biological testing.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:32]** And then the fourth one seems to be a higher security data module.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Can we try again on that?

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:39]** That one seems to say more about... It reads more of decontamination in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** Can we try again on the fourth module?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** So each of these has a separate firewall.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** Some of them are going to need root access to get into.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** So if you guys want to try and get in, that's fine.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** There's four attempts.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** So we have to succeed four times in a row before...

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** To get all of them, but the more secure one is going to be tougher.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:12]** But the thing is that because you rolled so well, you also know that this computer has this thing where if you fail by five or more to get in, it will start erasing modules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Well, damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Well, it's worth a try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:27]** or we get some information and then try because we can get lower level information without doing this like sort of death throws or is it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:33]** Well, each one is behind a firewall, so failing the firewall checks will start, will erase it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** For all the firewalls in total, if you fail five for any of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:43]** The fourth module has... Three are like one layer of secure data module.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:47]** The fourth one is a higher layer of... Has multiple layers.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** No, sorry.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** I shouldn't say higher layer.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** It's more secure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:59]** So, okay, we have weapon testing, frequency testing, biological testing, and the fourth one is a data module that's more secure that deals with what topic?

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Decontamination.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Decontamination.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:07]** Well, if we're going to do this... So, I think Nico's thinking he wants to hack this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, same.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:15]** Nico, do you feel very confident or just confident?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** I feel very confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:23]** I'm going to inject him with a booster for a plus two enhancement to skill checks.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Okay.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Nice.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** All right.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** For like, I mean.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** For computers?

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** It just says skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** I don't know if this really counts.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:35]** Yeah, computers is a skill check because it's under skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** Plus two enhancement bonus.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Aids a creature in one manner or another.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** It affects for a number of rounds.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** What do you guys say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** How does that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** That's a good idea, Dr. Okay.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Do you want something to help?

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** And then I'll also aid.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** I'm going to help out too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** So Nika's going to go over to here.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** She's going to be like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:52 - 00:50:07]** I got this I just rub his shoulders with this like you know cream that's sticky but it feels good it makes you feel like maybe like your brains are firing a little bit better


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** You know what?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:16]** Under normal circumstances, I feel this is pretty weird, but seeing as though you just rubbed B12 cream all over my shoulders here.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Let's go.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Yeah.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:31]** And then I'm going to use my polymath ability to automatically succeed in assisting.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Shit.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** And I think Nick just bought the farm.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:40]** Nat 20 plus 13 plus whatever you guys assist.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** And I successfully assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** That makes it 15, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Nice hack in there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** So you got a nat 20 plus 13 plus 15.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** And then what did yours thing add?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** I gave him a plus two on his skill checks.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Got it.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** And then I also succeeded in an assist.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:00]** Yeah, same.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** Rick pauses a bajillion, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** And gives a thumbs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:11]** And then goes back to... We unlock all the modules at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Rare praise from the murder bots.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Thank you, Rick19.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** Okay, so what is the number?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** So I think the number is what?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** 20 plus 17?

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** So 37.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** 37, okay.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Which one are you trying to unlock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** Um... The fourth one, yeah, the fourth one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** Okay, so you go...

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** And everything just like zones in.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:48]** And that same feeling of like a telekinetic, telepathic connection happens with a computer where you're moving, but you're thinking and you're not sure which one's coming first.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Right.

**[00:51:50 - 00:52:13]** and as you go to go into that module you like find a way back you start going through you and and you're about to do it and and and and you like you see the way through and you press enter and then it erases say what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Wait, so did you get all that information?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** You get a natural 20.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** This is the best you can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Plus we assisted both.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** So that was 33 plus us both assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** And we failed by five or more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** What the actual... What?

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** See, here's is just flabbergasted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** He's just like, I'll say this.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** 20 is the best that you can do.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:43]** And the two things that are tough is that you realize that one of these needs root access.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** It's probably that one.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** And root access is a lot harder to get.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** And you didn't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** All right, look, let's try another module.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** They're less secure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Hacking is stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** But I will say this.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:06]** Because you did so well on that, I will let you roll that over into another one.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** I've never put any points into computers, ever.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Because you got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** That's so stupid.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:23]** Every time I've tried hacking, I've done super well, and you've been like, no, I'm going to step on your dreams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:43]** listen we you went for the far like you went for the thing at your suggestion i don't know you're the one in charge i'm sorry can you can you rewind us so so like if they would have done how do you get root access any of the other boxes what did we need to score we needed 40 is that what you said


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** You would need at least five plus 37.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** We need 42 because we failed by five or more.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** At least that much.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** I mean, if you look, getting root access.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** It's probably like 50.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** You have to be pretty good.

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:00]** And if you're just doing this right now with an unfamiliar thing that you're trying to work through, root access is tough.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:04]** But you can roll it over into another module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** All right, we'll do module three with the 37.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Did the grays move or anything?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** They haven't moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Nico's going to be like this.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** We're going to go for number three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** That's biological.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Biological testing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Yeah, we're going to go for number three.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** And Nico's just going to be like, he's going to be typing at three.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** He's going to be like, damn it.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** I can't believe what I just saw.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** I almost had it.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** I got some bad news, guys.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Module number four has been deleted.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:46]** I mean, I think I just might have gotten access on number three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** I take back my thumbs up.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Shut up, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** I didn't do anything to help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** I gave you a thumbs up.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** That means good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Go back to your scrap pile.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Just ignore him.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Just go for the third module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** So you do the biological one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** That's number three, right?

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Module number three?

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Yeah.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Okay.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:14]** So it seems like that module opens fairly easily.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** You needed at least DC-25 to get into that one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:25]** Now, when the firewall comes down, you're able to access information from that one.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** And it seems like one of the these.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:38]** One of the rooms around here is this room where they're doing some sort of biological testing.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:43]** But there's also this component of magic.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:54]** And it seems like as you pour through, they're trying to summon creatures, but also combine technology and quantum mechanics into the summoning.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** And this maybe makes sense to you, Hears.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:06]** And it seems like they have been successful at summoning and controlling smaller monsters that are like maybe you.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** There are no like what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Like maybe like starfish shaped.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:16]** So more things that are like demonic monsters.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** Like asteroid lice?

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Asteroid lice are not demonic.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Things that are extra planar.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Things that are evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** Could we figure out if they were successfully controlling them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** It seems like they were.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** It seems like they were successful in summoning them.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Manipulating them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:46]** But the primary focus is on summoning and capturing them, it seems like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:50]** Nico's going to look over and hear something like... This could be a fiendish weapon.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** He's going to be like, can anybody make sense of this?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:58]** I mean, I understand some of this, but magic stuff's going way over my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:05]** I understand how it's theoretically possible, but I never thought it could be... I never thought I'd see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Could I use my...

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** What do they do?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:12]** This would be something normally identified by mysticism.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** Okay.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Yeah.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Right?

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** Sure.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** That's fine.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:33]** I'll use my pious scientist ability to call upon the wisdom of your Issa and discern through my life science check what mystic powers be at work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:42]** You notice that there's a particular emphasis from the thing is that this data is half telepathic, half like a lot of stuff.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** So tell me what your role is and I'll tell you more what you know on your mysticism.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Check.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Check.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Check.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Check.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** That is 29.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** 29.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Baller.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:03]** Again, as you slot in the sense of, like, maybe your fingers are moving you through the logs.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:07]** Maybe it's your mind reading and anticipating where you're going to look.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** So then it puts the text right in front of it.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** It, like, knows what you want to see.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:17]** And you start realizing that there's this emphasis on trolls.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:21]** And there is something happened there.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:46]** recently that seemed like it was a bit beyond their grasp like an experiment that they kept trying to do over and over and it failed or didn't quite go maybe like they wanted perhaps they summoned something that they didn't quite understand about rug of moya


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** It just means that whatever they summon, we're gonna have to fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Probably.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** We've gotten loose here.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Could we figure out what that is that got out of control?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:18]** uh yeah it it seems like that was when they were starting to focus on trolls it seems like they went through a lot of other demonic creatures trying to do things and it seems like there was something where they were able to take trolls and manipulate them and pull them in somehow and it's just the pink hair and yep exactly blue hair yeah that's it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** Can't stop feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:24]** So here's what I'd really like to get his hands on.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** How they were able to do some of this before it got out of control.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Can we get that information from this?

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:33]** Maybe scrape it off and be like, cool, this is maybe something we could try in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Yeah.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:42]** If you want to start to pull more of that, I'm going to say that you're going to need to try and like pull the module and take it with you or take a lot of time to get it off this.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:46]** So this is you working through data and there's a lot of data in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** So I could physically pull the module out.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** I have a high engineering.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** We could try it if that's what we need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** I think it is possible.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:57]** Let me check the core rulebook and make sure because there are some things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:07]** Nico was going to ask later about what parts from the computer and the salvage here that he could actually take and try to build a better data pad for his device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** I want to make sure there's still two other modules you can hack into, right?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Also...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:15]** Yeah, we should hack into those first before we try to pull it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Is this also a simulation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Yeah, just layers of simulation.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** That would suck.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** But I could see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** Oh, you think, Will, you think this is a simulation within a simulation within a simulation?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** The threefold conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Well, try it again.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:37]** The fourth level one would have been like, oh yeah, this is all a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** These greys seem suspicious.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]** The greys and trolls, that's, yeah, those two things are something I didn't expect to find in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** I did not expect this in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** So what are you guys thinking?

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:57]** Do you want to try and, like, as this is happening, the ground again shakes.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** Rick, maybe you're starting to actually make a little bit of dent on...

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** on this rubble.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** It's starting to kind of come clear a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:10]** Rick's actually going to set down his artillery laser and start actually moving the rubble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Okay.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:21]** So, Nico's going to, after really getting in with that computer there for a couple seconds, he's going to step back away a little bit, just a little shakily.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** His hand's going to go up to his face.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** That computer just seemed like it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:57]** bonded with your neural network i know it feels like you and the computer one it kind of feels good it feels great to be able to like see truly see the information rick is that how you are all the time we can't even communicate with the outside can we


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** Is it just memory?

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** Do the memories just flash in your head?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** Like, how do you see it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:30]** an android is that what it's like where things just flash i would have to ask you the same thing about how you see as a human nico i'm i'm just curious how androids see the world like i'm i'm genuinely curious i see the world through my eyes uh as for flashbacks i i may or may not have had a few visions induced by certain events


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:40]** What happened over here was we interacted with the device, and all of a sudden the computer intuited what we wanted to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:45]** I cannot say that I have any kind of experience with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Nico looks away.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** He's a little disappointed.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:56]** He looks away a little disappointed a little bit, but his attention is very much kind of...

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** Stuplified might be the best word for it.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** Stuplified of the computer over there.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:06]** He's kind of a little in awe and in wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:23]** Yeah, I mean, as you maybe like reach down and the three of you that have used the computer, as you like maybe grab your comm unit, it feels so silly to like touch a comm unit, you know, to like use a tactile feeling to use this technology.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:26]** You're like, why can't it be like the computer?

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** Yeah.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** you know, why can't you just intuit it?

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** And it does it.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:36]** Is there something special with that computer or is this just, they were just doing so well that it, it was felt that way.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** It seems like it's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:47]** It seems like, yeah, it seems like it's, it's part of this technology and I'm, I'm going to harken back to, I think it was Rick.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:50]** You had the culture, Rick, you had the culture check, right?

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Yeah.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** You guys have just had a lot of crushing checks tonight, which is great.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** And, and,

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:20]** i will say that one of the things that you realize is that like there is not much about gray technology really but you do know that what you've heard is that like they can do some pretty outlandish things like that's that's why there's no information on it it's because they have such high technology they can just yeah and like again they don't want you to know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:47]** you go try and find something and you're like I was just on the site I can't I was just here you like see a report as Rick starts like clearing away the final set of rubble near the store and he looks at you guys he says are you finished playing with the computers yet I just want to say that the greys are nothing to mess around with what little information that they have on them they are very dangerous creatures


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:55]** Indeed, but they're not as dangerous as Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Wow, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Good timing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:03]** We should hack the other two, and then I want to try to pull this module.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** Okay, let's burn through it.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:08]** So give me your computer checks.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** So Nico, a little bit more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** I can attempt to assist.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Okay.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** Nico, a little bit kind of greedily this time because he looks a little addicted.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** Yeah.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:42]** uh that's a 12 plus 11 that's 23 plus whatever the assists were i assist okay i assist it's a dc 10 right or is it 15 it's dc 10 to assist to aid yeah so that's what 27 so which one did you want to try and look at number two which one was number two number two is uh frequency okay research

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:49]** So it seems like you do go in, Nico, and just like the last time, you're like, oh, I know what to do.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:56]** As soon as you slot in, that euphoria kind of rushes through your brain, hits all the receptors that you were thinking of, and you're like, yeah, I know.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** I know what to do.

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** You slide in.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** It comes up.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** And once again, you see a lot of data.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** You're in.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** You're past the firewall.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:11]** You see a lot of data that seems to be some sort of testing of...

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** What's a good way to call it?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** What's the word?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:16]** Like a lab experiment?

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:20]** Yeah, it seems to be... Probing?

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:30]** It seems like this is a lot of research on infrasound, which is like incredibly low frequencies.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:34]** Seems like it was some sort of technology, not quite clear.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:35]** Sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** For the brown note?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:40]** I don't know what that means.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Do you know what the brown note?

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** Never heard of the brown note?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** No.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:46]** You want to explain it?

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** Kevin's got this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:51]** Oh, it's the frequency that forces the human body to defecate.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Yes.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Okay.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:54]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:00]** It seems like there was a lot of... I'm surprised John didn't know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** Same here.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** It was a South Park thing, right?

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** No, it was The League.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** The League?

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** Okay.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:09]** I think South Park also covered... I think so, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** I think you're right.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** I'll say this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:15]** You can tell from... Again, you would need to spend a lot of time to go through all this.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:20]** It seems like this is... They were testing it on live subjects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:21]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:25]** And you said, what kind of frequency was it?

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** That might get messy.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Infrasound.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** Infrasound.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:29]** It might get messy, indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Infrasound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:38]** So, I mean, and Nico's going to say as he does, it's like, this is what finding the truth feels like.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Count me in.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:42]** Feels good, doesn't it?

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:46]** You have no, well, actually, you do have a slight idea.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:46]** I have an idea.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** You do.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:52]** I kind of want to bring this computer home, to be honest.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** I want to know how to make this.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:56]** Okay, that's really interesting.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** What about that first module?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** Let's go for it.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** Let's go for it.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:04]** Another Nat 20.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** Let's go.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:06]** It's 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** Can I look and see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:11]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** I just so happen to have a chance cube.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** Yeah.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:17]** It's literally a chance cube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** It's impressive.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:18]** This is impressive.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** I don't mean to interrupt you guys.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:25]** This is like the role play and the great roles and stuff.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:30]** But Mythbusters did an actual episode on the brown note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:59]** is it real I'm sure it's not okay this is amazing all right we need to watch this as a group I think it was probably like unconfirmed or plausible one of those impossible yeah I don't know yeah infrasound again these are things that you're like I have heard of infrasound I didn't think it was real I have heard of like summoning and magic and technology didn't think it was real the brown note you're like that's fucking real

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:06]** Nico, this time it is just, again, 20 on a skill check is the best that you can do.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:13]** And the past times that you've been hacking, maybe after that first time when everything erased, you're like, I need to change the way I'm doing this.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** And then boom, boom, boom.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:15]** You just nail them.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:19]** And then with here's and Dr. Okay, with your help.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** And then especially with this one, you're like, I got it.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:30]** This is data about some sort of testing of a weapon that,

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:37]** And the weapon seems to be something that.

**[01:09:38 - 01:10:04]** can shapeshift and words like astrozoan ping up cells ping up and it seems like it's testing of some sort of creation of a weapon that can polymorph that can change and and have a couple different states depending on the users like will and what is like programmed into it again you've never heard of a weapon that can do this before

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:08]** And I will add, also being tested on live subjects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:09]** Oh, my.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:10]** Wow.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:16]** Nico's going to be like, this is way more advanced than anything we were working on at Orion Industries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:16]** Barbarism.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** I want it.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:20]** Only fit for Greys.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** This is some really illegal stuff here.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** I would never touch this.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** Even my father wouldn't have touched this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:34]** They are clearly moving beyond any sort of moral ethics to test some of these things, right?

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:38]** As you put it together, you're like, that would never fly in the pack of worlds.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:59]** The other thing is that you realize that these logs, the way that the conduit and everything runs, and the way that the computer realizes, it's kind of like if you've played Cyberpunk 2077 and you go into the, what's it called, the loopbacks where you can watch memories.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:07]** The screen kind of overlays in your mind's eye and you realize that this data is coming from information that's nearby.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** Oh.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:14]** What, the data in the computer is being sourced from other areas nearby?

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** It's all correlating there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** Yeah, it's not like this is being beamed in from somewhere.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** This is all your land ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** All the experiments happened here, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]** All in the same room.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:27]** They are nearby, yeah.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** In the same room?

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** In nearby rooms.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:34]** No, this is throughout the ship or whatever this apparatus is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:36]** I'm just being very clear on this, though.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:42]** Niko would know that the information is coming from other parts of the ship, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** It's coming from nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:47]** It's coming from nearby, but in other parts of the ship, not in this room.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** We don't even know we're in a ship or not.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** Not in this room.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** That's the part that I will echo.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** So Niko is going to say...

**[01:11:54 - 01:12:04]** Well, if the Greys live up to their reputation, it's pretty safe to say no, that if there's one of them left alive, they probably know we're in here, and they probably know we found their secrets.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** That's true, and that's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:08]** The ground rumbles again.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:11]** Here's wants to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:13]** Wait, the ground has been rumbling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]** Yeah, this whole time since you landed.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** Oh, the whole time, ever since, yeah.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:20]** The whole time since you landed, things will randomly rumble.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:21]** Okay.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** And move.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:24]** It feels like the place is a little unstable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Yeah.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:34]** Here's wants to hack it, but before he does... Okay, so the first attempt would be, let's try to get it programmatically, try to get it from this software or whatever.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Yeah.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:37]** And failing that, try to pull the actual module.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:39]** But if we try to hack it...

**[01:12:39 - 01:13:01]** further to get more information on how to do these things ourselves is that going to if we miss the the check is it good is it going to erase the module well i have another i have another way to know that from our investigation can we download the data onto our data pads you can't download the data there are four modules right so there are four modules well you got three and one one is erased


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:06]** So we can grab one of them already and just try to incorporate it, correct?

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** If we wanted to, theoretically, Module 4.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Yes.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:09]** It's been deleted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** So here's the thing.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:19]** Downloading the data would either take you a long time to figure out how to do, because this technology, again, is like...

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:49]** interfering with your brain like you're not sure that you can just like plug in a USB and just pull it off it's not that straightforward but taking the modules out possible but I'm going to tell you just like I apologize if I didn't before again root access means like this is fucking difficult to get into right pulling the module out will just require an achievable but high DC because you realize that it's going to take time

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:55]** And you're going to need to like go through the like the files are literally in the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:55 - 01:14:00]** But either way, is it going to take as much time to like pull, to download?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:04]** It's going to take probably, you can't download it.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:06]** Like your comm device would not be able to handle this much data.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:12]** So we can't digest in some way how to do the things that they're doing without taking out these modules.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** That's the only way forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** Right.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:19]** And also keep in mind that this is stuff that's like an entire research into this.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:22]** It's not like you could just be like, oh, I'll just do it in my room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:24]** This would be like a university research system.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Like a supercomputer almost.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** Yeah, sounds like it.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:27]** Like city-sized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** Are you done over there?

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** We need to get moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:32]** No, no, no.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:33]** We're not done.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]** This is super valuable information.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:38]** And I think in order to...

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** I kind of want to use it.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** I don't know how you feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** The ground is shaking all around us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** The ground is shaking.

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:44]** Time's running short, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:45]** Let's pull down.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:49]** I'm not so comfortable to be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:54]** Just give me some time to pull the modules if you guys can help me out.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** I really think we could use this.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** Let's get it out.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:57]** Let's try.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:59]** It's going to be hard, but let's try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:06]** John, if we didn't care about the information so much,

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:10]** Would that lower the DC at all to incorporate into any of our own technological devices?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:12]** That's a good question.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:21]** Like, basically, if you just want to pull the USB drive out without ejecting it is kind of what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:26]** If we just wanted to pull it out to just basically use the computer as salvage for our own means.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:28]** Because we already know the information.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:29]** It's going to take a long time.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:32]** And to be honest, we really can't plug it in anywhere else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:32]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:34]** I mean, you could try and pull some things out of it.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:36]** But I'll say this.

**[01:15:36 - 01:16:00]** if if you guys are going to try and pull out all three and or salvage stuff to find stuff that's usable i'm gonna i'm gonna like start rolling some dice because i don't want to be the one to say no but i'm gonna give you the like i think we need to get out of here quickly where the exit but john like can if we for example pull the weapons module or the weapon research module could we make a weapon like that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:01]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:05]** Because I think that, like... It's too far forward.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** It's like, this is technology.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:11]** It would be like, well, so here's the thing.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** One, here's the thing.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:14]** Here's the thing.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** The thing.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:15]** Okay.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:20]** One, I'm just going to reiterate, the data is coming from places nearby.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:22]** Okay.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:29]** And then two, this would be like you finding a flash drive that was like, so this is the way to build a time machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:29]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** That's what I'm looking to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]** This is the way to build a time machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:35]** Let that sink in for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:41]** Whether that was achievable by you is completely up to you.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:42]** Are there plans in there?

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:44]** Could you try and piece them together?

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:44]** Yes.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** How long would that take?

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** I don't know.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:48]** We can figure that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:52]** Nico's going to look over at here and say, look, I don't think we're going to be able to take the data with us.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** We've been able to glean as much as we can from it.

**[01:16:55 - 01:17:01]** Let's just try to salvage whatever we can and try to increase our own technological resources while diminishing theirs.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:03]** Why don't you salvage one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:06]** I like to get out of this situation alive.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:07]** I don't care about the information.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:11]** And he moves the last bit of the rocks and he says, I have a feeling we should go this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:14]** And Nico, Nico's going to stay at the computer.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:17]** He's going to try and take out the fourth module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** Okay.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:19]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:20]** All right.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:26]** Niko's also going to ask, hey, you want to be a pirate and help me out here?

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:29]** I'm going to try to take out this fourth module, the one that's already been deleted.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:31]** That's only for scrap, right?

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** It's not just for scrap.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:35]** It's for trying to incorporate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:37]** My plan is to take the module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:40]** I'm going to try to build a super computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** I'd say it's like 10 or 15 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** 15 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]** You guys are talking.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** You're figuring it out.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** You're trying to do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:53]** Here's is going to still try to pull the damn weapons module.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:55]** Because while they're doing this, we can try that.

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:56]** Let's do this one at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:57]** Oh, fuck.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:03]** That fourth module really hates me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** Natural one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** Yeah, plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:07]** So this is the plus thing.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:11]** The plus side of skills is that it's not an automatic failure.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:12]** It's just probably the worst that you could do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:13]** Yeah.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:15]** So I got a plus nine, so it's a ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:19]** You pull it out, and then it just doesn't work.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** It won't pull out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:51]** all right nico's gonna be like let's try it again it's a it's it's it's a paperweight okay let's try it again and he's gonna what are you trying to do he's gonna try uh rip out the biological one number three do you guys help him yeah for sure um i assist i it's a 25 25 i do not assist okay so plus two right or is it it's plus two yeah

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:52]** So 27?

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:53]** Yeah.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:55]** What did you roll, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:57]** I rolled a natural 16 plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** Natural 16 plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:00]** Wait, is that plus 2 still going for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:24]** it wouldn't it would have worn off yeah i think it would have worn off and out because you guys have been going through you like it took you time to pour over this data trying to figure it out so you had a 23 no plus 9 i did that without your bonus right so plus 16 plus 9 is 25 plus 2 27 yeah you do pull it out

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:30]** It doesn't become a paperweight and shut down, but it does seem like you ejected it pretty quickly.

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:32]** So I'm just telling you the DC is 30.

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:36]** So it's possible to pull it out and have it be ready to go.

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** And you're like, all right, cool.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:41]** But you're going to need to repair it in order to...

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:42]** Get any data off of it.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:49]** What state that is, I will be honest, the state that the data is in, I'll probably do a percentile dice to see how much is there.

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:53]** Probably going to be a lot of it since you were really close to DC 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:54 - 01:19:58]** Well, if you didn't care about the data and you just wanted the module just for your own upgrade purposes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:59]** You have the module.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:03]** You need to repair it, I think, to pretty much get through it, but you could take some time to repair it.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:04]** You might need to take it somewhere.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:11]** But again, you are literally, think about it this way, you are pulling gray technology out of a gray computer.

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:13]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:17]** Also, does my data pad, would that even have the power supply even to run the module?


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:17]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** We can figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]** Yeah, I think it's an off-air conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:26]** Here's just going to quickly pull the weapons one, and then we'll get the hell out of here.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** Anyone want to help me out?

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** I'll assist you.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:29]** Help me out with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:30]** Thanks.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:31]** Ah, damn it.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** Success on the assist.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:35]** It's just a nine, though.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:37]** Nine plus...

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:40]** You had your modifiers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:42]** That was with my modifier.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** Oh, shit.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** Well, he's got an 11, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:45]** He's got an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:47]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** Alright, last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:49]** Last module, then we're out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:50]** Let's get this one.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:50]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** Kevin fell asleep.

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:53]** 19.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:53]** Plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Plus assist.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:56]** Plus 2.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:56]** That's 21.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:57]** Fail.

**[01:20:58 - 01:20:59]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:00]** Blackjack.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** You pull it out.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:02]** Hold on.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:03]** You pull it out.

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:06]** The lights go out and then come back on.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:13]** It's in the state of the other one where it's going to need some repair, but it is not a paperweight.

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:14]** So you have two modules.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:15]** Both need repair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:44]** fascinating stuff really great radio rick so as this is happening rick i imagine you just the rocks are completely cleared um but he does want to look at the doors he has a feeling he wants to go south but like is there anything on the door to indicate what's behind it uh what do you mean is there any symbols any you know instructions and reminder i can read aclo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:47]** There are no instructions on the door.

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:49]** It's just a door, a blank door.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:50]** Are both doors blank?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:54]** Yeah, both doors appear to be blank.

**[01:21:54 - 01:21:58]** Okay, then he's going to glance over at the others and say, are you ready to go?

**[01:21:58 - 01:22:03]** And he's going to lift up his laser over his shoulder and reach for the door.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:05]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:09]** John, is there anything else in this room we can pick up just easily?

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:11]** Not like rolling any checks for her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:38]** no you would need to spend time to salvage anything i'm going to look at this body real quick okay so you look at the body which you told me a long time ago yeah and damn i was gonna try and sync up my events with his what would it be what are you trying to do uh would just be perception like search the body for any identifiable things search the body for identifiable things that is the question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:40 - 01:23:09]** pierced disguise search I don't know search this is interesting 24 on one of the grays in some sort of weird pouch that's like maybe it's grafted onto them maybe you're not quite sure probably honestly it seems like they have like like some sort of clothes that you didn't think would be pockets but then you're like oh there's a pocket here you find this strange metal

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:16]** And when you look at it, you're like, this has to be some sort of maybe like key card or something.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:18]** And that's all that you find.

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:20]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]** Is it the similar metal as the relic?

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:22]** Ah, good question.

**[01:23:22 - 01:23:25]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:50]** here's uh-huh i'm gonna take it out you hold it out is it i'm gonna you know keep my chemilizer standby for my custom micro lab i'm gonna just be like behold okay so you're going through that out of the corner of his eye you're like looking through whatever it is meant to do it's malfunctioning it's not working quite right can i repair it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:50 - 01:24:04]** maybe but you also have no idea what this technology is okay so it will take some time also while he's doing his experiment can i do a brief inspection of the room see if there's any other like valuable electronics give me a quick perception check okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:26]** here's as you as he pulls it up you realize that like there like something happens and you just pull out the thing that rolu gave you and as you move it towards it it like flickers and then comes back

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:32]** It's like picking up something and then not really responding.

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:33]** It like flickers blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:33 - 01:24:35]** Like a radiant power source or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:38]** Control a field, perhaps.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:41]** Is it just the thing that Rolu gave me that's flashing?

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:42]** Or is that other thing flashing too?

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:44]** The thing that Dr. Okay picked up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:45]** No, that's not flashing.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:47]** It's just the thing that Rolu gave you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:47 - 01:24:49]** Uh... Rolu was a gray?

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:51]** He was a secret gray.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:54]** Or he was working with grays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:56]** He acquired this at the very least.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:57]** And, um...

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:04]** Okay, so here's like brings out the relic and like compares the way it looks and feels to what Dr. Okay has.

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:06]** The metal feels very similar.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:11]** Okay, so the damn grace might have made this.

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:11]** Fierce bites it.

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:13]** He feels it with his mandibles.

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:15]** It feels kind of similar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:20]** Nico, I'm going to roll a percentile dice and we can off air talk about what you found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:22]** Oh, I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** Okay.

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:24]** For perception.

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:25]** Cool.

**[01:25:25 - 01:25:26]** So you're doing this.

**[01:25:26 - 01:25:29]** Nico's walking around trying to find some things to salvage.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:30]** You're holding this thing.

**[01:25:31 - 01:25:35]** Rick, did you just walk into the southern door?

**[01:25:35 - 01:25:36]** I pushed the door open.

**[01:25:36 - 01:25:38]** You pushed the door open.

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:44]** And as you push the door open, the door does seem to be... Unlocked.

**[01:25:47 - 01:25:53]** And when you push it open, I'm going to reveal something here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:56]** I got to remind you, I have my gun in my hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:58]** Thank you for the reminder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:59 - 01:26:02]** It's cocked and ready to let go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:04]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:26:04 - 01:26:09]** I don't trust anybody except for maybe the three people in the room with me.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:10]** That's fine.

**[01:26:10 - 01:26:11]** Solid.

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:15]** Maybe to barely trust them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:16]** Yeah.

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:20]** It's always the ones who are the least trustworthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:22]** Indeed.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:24]** Democracy hath spoken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:25 - 01:26:25]** It has.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:30]** You go and you open the door.

**[01:26:32 - 01:26:38]** And as you open it, there's this sense of, like, this, like, purple light.

**[01:26:39 - 01:26:46]** And then you see before you this blue light that seems to be emanating from the space in front of you.

**[01:26:48 - 01:26:49]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:51]** What?

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:51]** !


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:56]** Took us long enough.

**[01:26:56 - 01:26:58]** Took you guys all session to go through.

**[01:26:59 - 01:26:59]** But it's good.

**[01:26:59 - 01:27:02]** You guys did a lot of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:02 - 01:27:02]** That was good.

**[01:27:02 - 01:27:04]** I mean, thank God Dr. O'Keefe looked for that.

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:06]** That's, like, huge for years.

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:07]** Yep.

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:08]** Oof.
