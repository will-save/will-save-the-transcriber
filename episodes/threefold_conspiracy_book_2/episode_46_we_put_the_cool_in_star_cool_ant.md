## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Previously on Will Save... The fellow's fiendish friend was dealt a wallop of a dollop, but our crew fails to find answers to the doll's demonic intents.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:15]** But do manage to find some toys really do fit like a glove...

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:19]** or a glistening gem-down gauntlet of magical fury and El Dracarnum.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:31]** And their spirits aren't encumbered by the lack of Red Rider wagons for Niko's hull, as Hears looks beyond the fusion fizz and slime to reflect on some Kyoker holographic imagery.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:40]** And oh my goodness, it's a koi-like creature inspiring a search for a telepathic console behind door number two.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:47]** But having entered, will their next encounter be a walk on a slightly radioactive beach?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:55]** Or are they not the only devils they ought to oh my monitor in this Monty Hall problem of unknown horrors?

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:59]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:53]** Listen, guys, the important thing is that I then, well, I put butter on it and it slid right off.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:58]** So that's all that you need to be concerned about.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** That's what she said?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Quite a story, I gotta say.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** Yeah, I don't know if butter would be my first choice.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** I mean, look, it has great properties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** Like canola oil or olive oil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Or baby oil?

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:18]** Given that whole story that you just told us, though, I feel like butter, as far as lubricating things, is probably not the right thing.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** Because, you know, it's tasty and stuff.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** That's the problem in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** And it worked.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** It worked.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** That's the thing.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** It worked.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Okay.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:31]** So, well, and with that, let's go ahead and record episode 46.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** I think we're already recording.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Oh, we are.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** All right.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** Well, since there's no way to edit and post, I guess this will have to stay in.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Welcome to episode 46.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Kev's on his fourth beer.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** We're going to have a good time.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Is it four?

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** It is four.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** Don't eat nothing but a good time.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** No judgment.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** To the office chair.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** I've never seen you drink so much while we've been recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:59]** Ain't nothing but nothing but a good time.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** And it don't get better than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Nick Belcher, everyone.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** Nick Belcher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:08]** If your voice wasn't so angelic, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** You would put butter on it and slather it on?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, make it taste better.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** Slather it off all night, buddy.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** I just want to roll back and say, did you say you were four seats to the office chair?

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** That's what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Yeah, that's great.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** It's fantastic.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:32]** All right, so I think that we should talk about something.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:56]** that especially given last episode i was going to jump into the talk about some shop talk and typically we don't shop talk right at the top we chill talk it's getting serious real fast it's getting super serial unless there's something i don't know if i'm ready for this level of commitment is that what we want to talk about because we can talk about that instead

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** That can be our opening salvo of a banter conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** It just seems like we're moving so fast, and I'd like us to slow down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** That's fine.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** Will looks like he's ready to play.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I can see it in his eyes.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Yes.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** Or discuss whatever, I mean.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Okay, well, so here's what I'm thinking.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:20]** What are your theories about where you are now?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** What are your characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** I thought you were asking where I am in life.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I feel okay.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** We're recording a podcast.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** I feel good about it.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]** I really enjoy hanging out with my friends on Saturday evenings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Yeah.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** Even remotely, it's still good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** I don't like this room.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:47]** I think we should just leave the monitor to itself.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** We don't technically know if it's going to attack us.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** I don't technically know much about it, but I know enough to not like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:04]** I like, I think this whole segment is, is like, are each of our characters sitting in a room, like staring, like just talking to the camera, like on modern family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** Oh, I didn't feel comfortable.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** So I left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** That's good.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** I might be more use outside.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:23]** It is true that you can't be useful outside of a room that's has an enemy in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** So it's true.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** That's true.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** You can lock the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:31]** Well, what we were going to say was that as I was reading that last time, Dr. K moved his token outside of the room.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** He was in the room, and as I was doing it, he's like, I don't have it up.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I have my one note up.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** No, thank you.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Classic.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Sneaky.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** Thank you.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Anyone else?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Not even this room, just the whole place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:49]** I mean, this could be the control place, or it could be another test place, to be honest.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** Every room we're going into has some new weird thing that's attacking us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** So, I mean, let's take it from the beginning here.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** Book one, we thought we were boarding the Chimera.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** And we came from clearly an organic place.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Unless everything we've gone through has been a simulation.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:17]** In which case, we are on a facility where clearly they can administer a whole series of tests in a large atmosphere.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** So we are probably not in a ship.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** Though we could be.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** It's not out of the realm of possibility.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** But I think it's more likely that we are on some sort of planet.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Most likely...

**[00:06:30 - 00:07:00]** moon where the grace can hold some sort of installation and clearly something's getting really messed up yeah yeah that's kind of my thought of where we're at our objective i think just as players is we got to find our way to the cheese and the cheese is finding a way to we're finding the cheese is either an ally or a means of signaling for an ally they call us rats yeah we're lab rats right now lab rats it makes a little different i guess yep

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** We're lab rats right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:09]** So Rick is sitting in this room with a flat color background, staring at the camera, a little nervous.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:17]** He's looking down, fiddling his thumbs, and he looks up and he goes, I am still not certain of where we are.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** We are definitely being held inside of this facility.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** I do believe the facility is some kind of...

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:50]** research ground for the grays which i hope to escape with my life um and possibly save these other three but other than that i i just want to get home to my family and he looks back down at his thumbs a sentimental synth keyboard plays modern family theme song yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Should we jump back in?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Yeah.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Let's play.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Very somber.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Let's play.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Let's play.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:09]** So these two rooms, the room you were just in, again, and the room you're in now, different tone than where you were before.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:18]** The past wing that you were in, a lot of heavy moral and ethical questions in some of the testing that they were doing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:24]** Here, I don't know, it seems a little lighthearted in the room that you were in before with the fusion fizz.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:27]** Until we had to fight this monitor thing.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** Well, that's in the new room that you're in now.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** But think about the interesting things in the new room.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** One, another working computer.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** You've only had two.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:43]** The first one, you found detailed modules on experiments around and something else.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** The next one in the data foundry, it locked up.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** You couldn't access it.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** The Fusion Fizz machine didn't have anything in it.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** This computer is the third computer you found that you've been able to access.

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:02]** And you did see that there were three modules that were on that computer.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:09]** But right as you saw that was when... The monitor struck.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** The monitor struck.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Well, instead, the monitor rings.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Again, it's this...

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** You had already sensed that it was some sort of a creature.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** There was a presence there, right?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:26]** And I'm going to go ahead and, as I'm talking, I'm going to bring you guys into World 20.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:35]** Because you sensed that there was a presence, but you also sensed that there was something about it that was dormant.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:40]** So it woke up when you accessed the computer.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:52]** And maybe right as you woke up, you and maybe you alone realized that maybe it was dormant on purpose as if it was awake when it was dormant.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:56]** And it didn't do anything.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:04]** And right at that moment, the rings start to turn.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** And the electricity cackles out from this plasma.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:12]** And four spider-like legs...

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:21]** push up and like shoot out, push up that this ball of plasma and spinning rings.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:27]** And again, as, as they're starting to sprint to spin, it's shooting out this colored light all around you.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:32]** And maybe Rick, you remember because you speak at low.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:36]** That when you're walking by, you notice some Aklo runes on it.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** But you couldn't really tell.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** You were more focused on the computer.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** You're like, there's some writing.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** I think that's Aklo.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** I don't know.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** So gems writing on these golden rings that are spinning.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** I'm going to show you on World 20 right now.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** I'm going to bring it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** Whoa.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** It's like a spider bot, man.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** This thing is not.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** This looks dangerous.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** Rick shoots him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:04]** Those little glowing objects, are they kind of like the shards that we found in the other room, Joe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** They're not spell gems.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Okay, good.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** But they do appear to be some gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:12]** For the listener, it's like a quadruped robot.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** So it's got like four legs.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:20]** Then it has like these little arms and claws sticking out from underneath that, like some kind of like octopus thing.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:31]** And it all connects into this glowing blue orb with two saw blade discs hovering around it that have glowing gems on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** If you've seen Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, it looks like a buzz droid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:39]** And if you've seen Dinotopia, it looks like every horrible machine-like thing in that.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Or read the books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** It's like if the Infinity Gauntlet was a saw blade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Agreed, yeah.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** It has like these glowing Infinity Blade style gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Fun stuff.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Is it still neutral?

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Is it still neutral?

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Yeah.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:02]** So it is still neutral because as you feel the presence come awake, it feels neutral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** It feels inquisitive.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Chad is very grateful that it's still neutral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:10]** You guys can't control Chad, the surfer Chad, by the way.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** What?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** I can control him?

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Yes, I can.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** No, you can't.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:15]** No.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Look at him go.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Hands off.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:20]** That should only be here's his control.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Get away from Chad.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** I just thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Chad, there's the surfer with an AK-47.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Hang ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Chad, hang ten.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** Yeah, he's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** So the voice you hear in your heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** Greetings, new test subjects.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** I am the monitor.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** And today is your lucky day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** And these two rings slow down.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** They spin.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** And the spider-like appendages go somewhere.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** You can see right through the creature, but they go somewhere.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** Rotate.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Pivot.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Swing.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** And then one arm sticks up.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** With a middle finger.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** And it's holding a cred stick.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** And you hear...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** First test is ready.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** First subject, if you please, present yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** Here's tells Chad to present himself.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:26]** Chad grabs the crunch stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** You can tell that it's not recognizing Chad.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** It's only recognizing you four.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** Nika's going to be like, oh, that didn't work.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** All right.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Well, Nico, you don't know that.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Only hears felt that.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Oh, okay.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** That it's only, like, it doesn't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Nico, wait.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** But here's just touching Nico's head and communicating telepathically.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Oh, yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Sorry.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Yep.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Forgot about that.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** So Nico's like, well, that didn't work.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:00]** And he looks over at Hears, and he's kind of saying in his head, like, all right, here goes nothing.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** And he's just kind of walk up to the center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:10]** And as that happens, Rick slowly raises his artillery laser up and aims it right at this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** And Dr. K comes back in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** And Nico's got a blaster and his dueling sword.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** He's got his asthma blazer pistol and dueling sword in his hand.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Greetings, first subject.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Please, take the object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** And what object are we talking about here?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** This is all in your head.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** All of you can hear this.

**[00:14:34 - 00:15:03]** this the cred stick it's gonna turn into like saw or something all right nico's gonna put away his dueling sword hold on to his blaster pistol and he's gonna take the cred stick pick up the cred stick this is a hunger game in your head or just squid games you hear yeah right it is please connect the cred stick to your device nico takes the cred stick and connects it to his data pad


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:08]** As you're connecting it, you feel like a little prick.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** You're like, ah, what was that?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** You look.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** There's like a little pointy end at the end of the cred stick.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** And it drew a little blood.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** Weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** As you plug it in.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** And Nico's going to be like, ah, what the?

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** What kind of games are you trying to play on me here?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** The thing just pricked me.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** What kind of cred stick does that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** This is all part of the first test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** First test my a**.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:41]** As the monitor says that, your device recognizes the credit stick.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** And you see 10,000 credits on your screen.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** On the credit stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Heyo!

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Look who's rolling in money here.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Hey guys, I just got 10,000 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** What was the cost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Yet to be determined.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** I hope it's not an arm or a leg.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** He's probably going to want something in return.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Watch out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** All right.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** Nico's going to look back at the device, and he's going to see what's popping up on his data pad, aside from the 10,000 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** You just see 10,000 credits.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** You could roll a computer's check to see if there's anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** He'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Okay.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** So that's a 12 plus 11 for a 23.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** 23.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:28]** The DC was 25.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:33]** So you don't know what, but it's doing something in the background.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** I'm, I'm quote unquote, failing forward.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** You can tell that there's something else.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** There's some other subroutine that's happening.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** When you put the crest again, you don't know what that is yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:47]** So Nico's going to look at the things like, all right, what's the big idea?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** I don't know what you're doing, but you're doing something level.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** I'm not a test subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:00]** As you say that, something about the way that you connected with the computers originally.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:06]** Nico was so almost addicted to that feeling in your head.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:14]** And as you look at the monitor, your vision kind of tunnels for a second.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** And it's almost as if...

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:29]** you get this affinity for sensing cryptic data structures and also creature genetics.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:37]** And for the rest of this book, you will have a plus two insight bonus to identify creatures, checks to recall knowledge and computers checks.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** You also need to make a reflex safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** To instant death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** I'm making a deal with the devil, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Hold on.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Dirty die.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** All right.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:59]** That's 13 plus 7 for 20.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** 7.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** Right as you start to feel that... Wait, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** You said 13 plus 7.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** 13 plus 7.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Plus 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Okay.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Because you said 7.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** Right as you... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** That would be bad.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** 20 means that you notice this.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** Your vision untunnels for a second.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** And you realize that the...

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:36]** Credstick is getting very hot and so hot that your thumb was on it as you were holding your pad and you take one point of fire damage as it gets so hot that it...

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:43]** It seems to curl and melt up, and your comm device stops registering it, and the 10,000 credits disappear.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** Your comm device is fine.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** The credit stick falls to the ground and is totally burnt.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:55]** And as it falls down, you all hear in your head, Thank you, first test subject.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** The first test is complete.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Second subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:25]** more arms turn turns up nico you see a fusion fizz cam in the little claws of this thing and it says second test subject please present yourself nico says i have questions what are your questions first test subject what are these experiments that you are performing on us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:29]** These are the experiments that I am programmed to perform.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Today is your lucky day.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** Second test subject, please present yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Device.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** What is your function today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:45]** My function is to present you your lucky day with these tests.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Second test subject, please present yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** And one leg steps forward.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** I like this thing, actually.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:00]** Nico's going to take a page from Tom Cruise and he's going to say, what the hell am I doing here?

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** You hear in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:08]** I can assure you, new test subjects, that these tests are harmless.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** But you must take the second test.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** What is their purpose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** Niko's going to step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** What is your name?

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** My name is the monitor.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** Monitor, what is your purpose of these tests?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** My purpose is to give mute test subjects the test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** What is the purpose of these tests?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** The purpose of these tests is... Pauses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** Second test subject, please present yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** Another leg steps forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:46]** Yeah, sense motive.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:52]** He also wants to talk to the computer to figure out what this is in more detail, if possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** Okay, give me your sense motive checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** That's 21 for Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** I got a 21 also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Yeah, we're all 21s.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** Dang, y'all crushing the 21 club.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:24]** i want to be part of the club yeah yeah you can drink their drinks all together except for the monitor pulls out three more alcoholic drinks no uh it's holding a fusion fizz cam a couple things one you sense that it was again it's still neutral the pause was less of a

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:55]** obfuscation trying to hide it doesn't and more of a trying to inquire an answer and then not getting like not finding an answer in time like it timed out and then just went back right so so you could ask again if you wanted to here's you do realize that with the computers check there are three modules you look you think about it more and you realize that one of the modules seems to have data on

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** Experiments, right?

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:04]** One of the modules seems to be a connection to the comm device.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:12]** And another module seems to be a communication to the monitor.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:18]** And as you realize that, you think, actually, I could probably...

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:31]** try and make a check in the same way that using a computer's check to command or send commands to the monitor, I could try telepathically to send commands to the monitor.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:53]** would that produce any other because he couldn't retrieve any other other information so it wouldn't necessarily help us like figure out what his purpose is though if i do that right it seems like the purpose of the test you could ask again it might have a different answer it might not you could ask more about the test sending or sending a command to the monitor okay

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:09]** is different in the sense that you can send it a command and you get the sense that it is clearly programmed in one way, in that if you send a command and it aligns with, in general, what it is programmed to do, it will do that.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** If it's not, mechanically, you will give it a condition.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:21]** As you are changing, you are messing with some of the logic behind it.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Yeah, it makes sense.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** So here's wants to do two things just real quick.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:30]** He wants to look up the results of those experiments from that experiment results module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** So those modules all have firewall of them.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** I would expect nothing less from, you know, a great computer.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** So you can do that.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** I will just tell you it will be DC 27, but that's also to command.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** And there's also going to be a DC 27, right?

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** You have to roll one for each module.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** Or you could try and command it with just sending telepathic commands.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:02]** That would allow you to use bluff, diplomacy, or intimidate instead of computers if you want to do that.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Nico's assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Nico's assisting and he succeeds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Okay.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** You haven't even decided what he's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** In any one of those skills, I succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** Nick, I want to role play it.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** So I'm going to roll back your success.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:20]** We'll assume that you do it, but like we got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:24]** If anyone wants to help out, they're welcome to with a computer's check.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** I can assist with computers.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Thank you.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** So what is the command that you're going to give it?

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Well, I don't want to give it a command yet.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** I'll probably do that telepathically.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:37]** I'm trying to break into the results of the experiments module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** So the experiments themselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** How those turned out.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Okay.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** So did Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** Do you have anything to help me with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** Yes, I think I can help her out here.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** This thing probably does something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** He successfully does some stuff.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:05]** So he does a 24, which with Nick and Will turns out to be at least a 27, so 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** Nick, did you roll a computer to aid?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Yep.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Okay, so it's 28.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** He just rolled something.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:15]** There are a couple bits of information here.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:23]** This lab is focused on research and development.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:46]** for projects not yet ready for extensive testing which makes sense when you think about it the infrastructure here is more is a bit smaller whereas where you were before each of those rooms were designed for that experiment this seems like it's a flexible room could be used for any number of experiments currently the monitors here

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** This is called laboratory OMA.

**[00:25:51 - 00:26:04]** Again, this idea that you're referring to the place with this sigil, and maybe you realize that's done as a precaution for privacy.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** In case anybody were to overhear, you can just say laboratory OMA.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** A gray could just say that, and they would know where it was.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:16]** Curiously, you do see a couple things.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:23]** You see a couple names that the results are not there, but there's a detailed experiment.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** There's detailed work on four experiments.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:30]** One is called Project ACS Gamma CredStick Gene Tracker.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** And you think that's probably what Nico just had.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:40]** Another one is called Project FF Alpha Chiller.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** And you think there's a fusion fizz can.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Again, there's no results.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** So that's why you saw mixed results with Nico.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** Nico was hurt, but also has some cool things for the rest of the book.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** You also have another one called Project P.S.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:05]** Epsilon Radiant Denton Chitin Psychotropic.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** One more time?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Project P.S.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:13]** Epsilon Dash That's me.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:23]** Dash Radiant Denton D-E-N-T-I-N Slash Chitin C-H-I-T-I-N Somebody type this in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** I am.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** I am.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Repeat that chitin part again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** What was it?

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:30]** Denton slash chitin psychotropic.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:34]** So radiant denton, like teeth psychotropic?

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** Radiant.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Yeah.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Radiant is one word.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** Denton slash chitin psychotropic.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** How do you spell chitin?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** There's one more.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** C-H-I-T-I-N.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** There's one more.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** It's called Project P-G.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** These are all letters.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** F-F-P-S-P-G.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:55]** Project P-G Zeta Dash Shade Walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Oh, that sounds cool.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** I wonder what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** Sounds like some stealth there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Yeah, that sounds awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** So, again, no.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** There's just some information about what it will do.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** One presents you with a cred stick.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** One presents you with a fuse-infused can.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:17]** One presents you with what appears to be a brush.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** And there's some sort of a liquid that is applied to the brush.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:27]** Then there is also a one appears to give you sunglasses.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** They're all...

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** culturally relevant.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** The sunglasses are Pinely brand, which you know is a super high-end brand.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Ray-Bans, very well made.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:48]** The brush appears to be a photon shine tooth and carapace polish travel applicator.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** That's the name that you see.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:56]** And again, it appears that the application or use of these instigates effects.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** The research is to figure out

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** What are those effects?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:04]** However, there's something else that you notice as you're going through.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:10]** Maybe you are reading these as one last folder, one last email.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:15]** Click on it.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:21]** Looking at some of the dates of some great correspondence, which I don't know what great correspondence would be like.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Dear so-and-so.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:23]** Arrogant.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** It's all telepathic.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** Talking to each other.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:34]** Looking at some of the communication, the gray slack, you realize that... Great discord.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** The great discord.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:43]** Dates suggest that projects here have been put on hold.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** And you think, maybe that's why this room hasn't... Seemed like the air was a little cleaner.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** No one's really been in here for a bit.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:57]** Projects here have been put on hold to allow for a focus on the Chimera project.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Oh, damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Okay.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** And that's it.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** And that's all that you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:07]** Is there any way we can, like, try to ascertain more about the Chimera Project?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Not on this computer.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** There's nothing else here.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** There are two other modules.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** One to connect to the comm device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** Am I seeing this right?

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** This project that we were a part of, you think?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:30]** As you connect, the monitor goes, second test subject, please present yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Another foot moves forward.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** At least he's walking slowly.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** We might be able to get enough of this done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Which person is it walking towards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** It's just walking forward because Nico moved back, right?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** I'm not looking at roll 20.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** It's walking in our general direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Yeah.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Well, we're all spread out.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** So it's walking towards the group of three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** So it's probably going to start walking towards Rick.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** I don't want to pop fizz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Oh, no, that's good.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** No, no, you should just distract him for a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:02]** Yeah, as it walks around the computer, Rick is going to slowly move away from it.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Just kite it.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Kite it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** Also, just going to say for all the audio listeners, Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** just keeps moving around the room.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:21]** is just jumping around, just trying to not... And as it steps forward again, splitting the difference between Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:27]** and Rick, and then as it does, you do hear in your heads...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:53]** the same voice but you do hear this is a warning second test is ready second subject please present yourself monitor do you understand that this building is collapsing and we need to get out of here second test subject please present yourself nico's gonna say to rick 19 he's gonna i don't think that's gonna work i think he's only programmed for one type of reception right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:58]** Here's telepathically says he's going to try like monitor pause protocol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Okay.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:05]** So you're going to send a, a command to the monitor, right?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Telepathically.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Okay.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:15]** And I need you to make a, with what, what skill diplomacy or intimidate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** I can aid.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Yeah.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** I don't think you can aid because you're not telepathically adding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** All right.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** I could give him, hey, you should say something nice.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Just diplomacy, right?

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** What do you say?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** To Hears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:37]** Hears is like, we really want to help you out with your experiments a lot.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** We're going to be really good test subjects.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:47]** We just need to prepare ourselves because we want to be in prime physical and emotional condition so that you can properly record the results.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** We want the best results for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:33:07]** another step comes towards yours since it's talking to you and it says this is your final warning second test subject please present yourself the second test is ready what's the second test again it's holding a fusion fizz can


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:13]** Rick just kind of says out loud to everyone, like, we should vacate the room and lock the door.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** It's not worth fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:19]** Nico's going to say, no, I don't think so.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Okay.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:28]** Nico's going to say, I think we should trust this thing.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** I mean, this is the first thing that hasn't immediately attacked us.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** And yeah, okay, burn me a little bit.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:38]** I mean, I feel, I don't know.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:50]** more aware it's weird you do yeah it's cool it's weird i i feel like i've been feeling the way when i was originally touching those computers it was just it was crazy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** I don't know.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Rick is also walking towards the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:56]** Yeah, Rick is, like, nodding at you as he, like, strafes.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Like, pointing at this thing.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** He's like, I am not a test subject.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** I am getting out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** I'm definitely not a test subject, too.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** I feel like FF Alpha Chiller is the least attractive of these.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** I don't want to be the second one.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** The shades sound kind of cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Here's... Do you send a...

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** If you want to send a command to do a different test, I'll let you do that.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Or you can send it to pause.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** I was going to say that.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** But I just tried to send it to pause, but you wouldn't let me do it.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** So I guess I'm not able to do it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Wait, no.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** I didn't say you couldn't do it.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:34]** I just said Dr. OK can't age you because Dr. OK doesn't have telepathy.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** You have telepathy.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** You can send a command to the monitor.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:40]** I asked you, do you want to do Diplomacy, Bluff, or Intimidate?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** And I didn't know which one you wanted to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** Oh, I did... It was Diplomacy, and it was a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Oh, 15.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Okay.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Maybe I super missed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** No, I didn't say it.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** I just... I thought... Never mind.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** I thought we were just going with Flavor instead of Rolls for some reason all of a sudden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Nope.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** There's a Roll.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** That's why.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** It's because you have to up with these, so you don't have to use computers if you don't want.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** You can use something else.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** The 15, it seems to register it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** And...

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:14]** it said to pause, but then it, it, that was right before it then stepped forward and said, this is your final morning.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** So it didn't listen.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:21]** You didn't, you didn't beat a high enough DC to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** I suggest we leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** Rick, I've never known you to be a scaredy pants.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:35]** I don't think this, while this thing uses the word test subjects, I felt nothing but augmented fear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:52]** by the test that i received i would urge you to engage your diplomacy pro i would urge you to engage your diplomacy uh protocols for the listener kelly is holding his face in his hands


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:55]** Okay, it's literally because it is a difficult decision.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** That's why.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:03]** It's hard because I think it'd be kind of cool to check this shit out, but I don't want to fight something else again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** You can send other commands.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:12]** It doesn't seem like it's taking no for an answer, but you can send other commands to... I would like the psychedelic one.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I'll volunteer.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Okay.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** I'm going to say that you say that out loud, and you're thinking, and it's picking it up.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** And it...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:50]** swings back in the fusion fizz can disappears and it says third test subject your test and i'm gonna take whatever it gives that i'm gonna throw in the chemilizer as you pick it up it produces a brush and there's a paste the brush hums kind of like a sonic air the paste oozes up into the bristles you see it come up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** This is a popular, you recognize it immediately.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** Again, it's a Photon Shine Tooth and Carapace Polish Travel Applicator.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** It's an on-the-go polish and brush.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** You put a little bit in the chemilizer.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:08]** As you do, the monitor in your brain goes...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:13]** Please apply to your teeth or to your epidermis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** What?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Because that's the whole point.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** The point is like you've seen this before.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** It's a toothbrush or you can brush carapace.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** It's like on the go.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** It's like a travel brush.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:31]** When you put it in the chemilizer, you realize that the pastes are actually made of nanites.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:36]** and it's radiating some sort of strange electromagnetic wave.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:42]** It doesn't seem harmful, but it does seem odd.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I don't think you know what a paste is.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** You haven't seen a paste like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:47 - 00:38:02]** So I have a plus four circumstance bonus to engineering, mysticism, physical science checks to identify an unknown drug, medicinal poison, or other chemical substance that wouldn't... Can I roll for it, or can I just see what this is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** That got you to know that there are nanites in the paste.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Okay.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:10]** This otherwise seems just like a typical shine, toothpaste, travel thing.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:13]** I don't have teeth, so I'll just put it on my skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Excellent.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Thicker for my kin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Rub it on your skin.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:36]** soft it does feel soft and maybe now that you know the nanites are there then you do feel it feels like when you put salt

**[00:38:36 - 00:39:05]** candy what's that rock candy in your mouth and it pops right pop rocks pop rocks yeah that does not sound like a good thing but and I don't know if I want that on my skin but it's energizing it away I'm sure that's fine couple things you do realize that it feels so good that you just feel very loose and you're actually going to take for an hour

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:10]** you have a minus two penalty to will saves and sense motive checks.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:21]** And for the rest of the adventure, if you fail a will save or a sense motive checks, you will feel that same minus two for 10 minutes.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** But,

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** You do feel really great.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:31]** And you're like, that part of my skin does look really good.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** And you kind of focus on it and you're like, it's like a badge.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Yeah.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:43]** Because now for the rest of the book, you get a plus two circumstance bonus to charisma based checks and enchantment spell save DCs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** I hate this one now.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:50]** I thought it was going to be along the lines of my biohacker.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** But let's continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:55]** And with that, you need to make a reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Oh, my God.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Come on.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Savage, John.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Savage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Sorry, buddy.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Eight.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:10]** You take... It's a little unclear in the book here.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** Two points of acid damage.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** As you realize that while you were feeling that...

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:20]** The nanites were actually disintegrating the brush, and it started to come down onto your tentacle.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** And the brush was starting to disintegrate.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** You drop it.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** That tentacle just falls off.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** That's a little extreme.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** But the brush is disintegrating.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Okay.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** And as that happens... I take two.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** You take two points of acid damage.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:42]** The arm slides back in, and then once again produces the fusion fist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** Second test subject.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** The second test is ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** That was the second one.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** Do you know how to count, Robit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** I am programmed to deliver four tests in order.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** You took, you requested, sorry, the third test.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** You are the third test subject.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Technically the second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** Here's telepathically... I have no intentions of taking this test.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** It takes a step over towards yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:20]** Here's telepathically tells it, monitor, disclose perks and side effects of remaining tests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:24]** Disclose the side effects of the remaining tests?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** The perks and side effects, yeah.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Make whatever check.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Nah, it didn't pass.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** It's like an 8 diplomacy.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** I'm not really diplomatic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** That's fine.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** You actually realized that

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** you actually realize that it probably doesn't know them.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** That's why they're experiments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** And it, and it says, I do not know the outcomes of these tests.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** My protocol is to deliver the test.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Second test subject.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Your test is ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:57]** Here says to the monitor, produce, produce, um, uh, number four and I'll take it.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** The sunglasses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Is it a shade walking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Yeah.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** I want to check that out.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** It's a sweet pair of sunglasses.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Alright.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** They look black.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:14]** And the lenses have the hollow film.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** So it's like multicolored depending on how the light hits it.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Chad's looking at it.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** He's like, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Chad is jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** I totally agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:30]** Here's, those would really help when I'm surfing and the sun's in my eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** We'll talk about it, Chad.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** We'll talk about it.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** Here's goes up and takes them.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Okay.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** You take them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:43]** Fourth test subject, please mount or hold the lenses to your eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** All right.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** He does that.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Okay.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Hold it up.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:51]** You're blind, but you can hear really well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** It's a possibility.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** I'm scared for you, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Everything turns.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** It's like inverted.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** All the colors switch.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** And as a result, you suddenly feel like you see structures that weren't there.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** And you're so off.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** You're so thrown off by this other world.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** And for some reason, the rest of the world around the sunglasses, you cannot see.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:27]** And instead, you see this purple and pink hyper structures moving in ways that you don't understand.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Bending, twisting things.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:38]** And for a brief second, your mind registers that you're looking at like a hypothetical fifth dimension.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:44]** And you were looking at it for at least 30 seconds.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:54]** And when that happens, you realize that if you wanted to move across the room, you could just move.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** And maybe you look and you think to yourself...

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** That Omo looks really cool.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** And you're standing at the southern edge of the corner.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:07]** Nico, you're standing right next to... Here's... Walked up to the monitor.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Between Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** and Nico.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** And you all just see... Here's go... And disappear.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** And then... Flash.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** And he's across the room.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** That's awesome.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** So, you can move through another dimension to, like, cut time.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** Or, like, space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Yeah.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** You just teleport...

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** to any unoccupied space.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** It's a move action.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** However, you need to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Will save!

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Will save!

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** What's gonna happen?

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:42]** It's a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:57]** 16, you, for a second, that blip overwhelms your telepathic and psychically connected brain as this hyper perception just floods your senses and you are swimming.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** You almost took damage.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:06]** And at that time, maybe it's been about 30 seconds and you all are wondering how he teleported.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:11]** And you suddenly, it's as if the sunglasses move away from your face.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:19]** And to everyone else, it looks like the sunglasses are becoming that same hyper dimension, pink, purple.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** And you all think, is that the fifth dimension?

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** And then they disappear.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:32]** And the last thing you see here is that they are now in the fifth dimension and they are lost forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:50]** But for the rest of the adventure, when you roll a natural one on an attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw while in combat, you will have the ability to teleport, but you will also have for like once, right?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:57]** Like as a move action, you will then be able to do that, but you will have the potential to take damage from being overwhelmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Damn.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:05]** Wait, so I can only teleport if I roll a natural one on an attack roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:11]** If you roll a natural one on an attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw while in combat, here's the stipulation.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** While in combat with a significant opponent, which typically means not just like a peon.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:22]** The point is that if you're doing something, then your mind will flash back to that hyperperception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:28]** And then I can control where I will appear, or will I just randomly appear somewhere else telepathically?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Or to teleport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** I would think that you can control, and it's probably just going to be for one round.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** And it's only for the rest of this book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:40]** It's a very cool power that I can use in very, very rare situations.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** It's very random.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** In a very rare situation, I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** It's a one-off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Yeah, indeed.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Um...

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** They look cool, though.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** So, that was a fun experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** I have a question.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** You're super unlucky twice against a significant opponent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** Were the glasses, like, large and bug-shaped?

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:05]** Because, like, here's his eyes are much bigger than the rest of ours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** No.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** They were just normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Normal.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** So, you just, like, put them on, like, the front of your nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Yeah.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** Yeah.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Just on the brim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** He fell on his... He fell on the nose of your scroll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:27]** It comes back, the monitor rotates, the spinning gold rings rotate over in Rick's dimension, and it says, Second test subject, your test is ready.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** And it takes, walks 10 feet over towards you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** I have no intention of taking this test.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** I think we should all leave the room and lock it in here.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Rick!

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Take it easy.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** I will not be convinced to be a test subject, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** And he's going to walk towards the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** This is your final warning.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** You need to take the test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** Rick, I suggest you leave the room.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Nico's going to say to Rick...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Rick, you're seriously going to sit there and try to tell me this?

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:01]** Like, I'm walking out the room as this thing says warning, last warning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** Nico's going to just implore Rick.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Yo, let's not fight this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Here's his leaving.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Here's his getting the f*** out.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** You all need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** No, he was left.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** You can't just do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** No, you were right here when I said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Truth be told.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** You sped up the take initiative because I was leaving probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** This is Rick19's fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** Just saying.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Oh yeah, it's my fault.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:33]** It's absolutely my fault that I didn't take this random test that was going to give you some kind of damage.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** Right, uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Alright, let's go in order.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Dr.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** O.K., what is your initiative?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** I rolled an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** That gives me a 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Or 19 total.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Sorry.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Rolled 18 on the die.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** 19 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Okay.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** All righty.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Nico.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** That's a 12 for me.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** 12?

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:58]** Yep.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Okay.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Rick, 19.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** 18.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** 18.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Who did I not hear?

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** 10.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** 10.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** All right.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** All right.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** It is going to be Dr.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** O.K.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** 's turn first.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** What would you like to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Hey, hey, monitor guy.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** Can I just take that fourth test?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Or it just has to be four separate subjects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** You hear back, you are the third test subject.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** No, but I'll be the fourth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Or the second.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** Whatever.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:40]** If you want to roll a check here to convince it to do that, you can try.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** I will allow you to do that.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** All on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** Okay.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** I'm standing right in front of it, by the way.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** That's fine.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** So I feel like you could confuse it to do that.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** And if I die, I die.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** Dr. K, do you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** I'm willingly being a subject.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Okay, Rick19.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** That's my thing.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** Your turn.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** You caused this, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** I caused this.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:15]** I gave everybody ample time to get out of the fucking room.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** I warned everybody I was not going to be involved in this.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Get out of the room.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** And you guys all stood there.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Oh, I don't know, Rick.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** You guys should try it.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Get out of here.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** I should just step out and close the door.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:32]** Rick steps out and closes the door.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:37]** No, Rick is going to hold an action until something violent happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Until what?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** What's the trigger?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** Until the creature does something violent.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Okay.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Nico, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** What are you doing?

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Nico's going to hold an action.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Actually, no, he's not.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** He's going to ask here's.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** He's going to say here's.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Get over here.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** I need your telepathic skills.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** Can you touch my forehead, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Let me see if I can make it there.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** I can.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** I just don't want to like.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** All right.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Yeah, I'm next to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Well, you can't move right now.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Here's not your turn.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Oh, yeah, it's not my turn.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Nico, do you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** Nico will just do total defense in case this creature comes after him.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Okay, nice move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** There you go.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** What do you want to do?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:24]** I'll tell you that it's a DC 18 if you want to send that command to the monitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** Okay.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:29]** To give it to Dr. Okay instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Yeah, it has to be a lucky roll.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** Let's see how that goes.

**[00:51:32 - 00:52:01]** i'd say it didn't make it so um here's walks over to nico or runs i should say but you sent it telepathically i did okay you walk over to nico maybe on the other side of nico i have enough movement for that by the way because of my extra thing yeah like um and what do you do does he incur an attack of opportunity technically but i'm gonna say that the monitor doesn't take it so you walk over to nico and what do you do here's just like i don't know why but like whispers that it's like what do you want nico's gonna respond back and was like touch my forehead and

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Alright, here's does this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Alright, I want to be in telepathic communication with this thing.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** What do you want to say?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Don't be dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Don't be dumb.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** And don't say it right now because you already took your turn.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Alright.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:22]** Dr. K, I'm going to roll a chance die because the command was similar enough.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** It just goes against the idea that each test subject should be different.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** I'm going to roll a chance die to see if he got through even though he didn't make it.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** So 50% above...

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** He will turn to you and do it.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Below.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** He will keep going after Rick.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Yeah, got the right die.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** That is a 60.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:45]** So it turns to you, Doctor, okay?

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** And it says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Second test subject.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Sorry.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Third test subject.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Sorry.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** Sorry.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Second test subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** As it's like reframing the way it's thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** Here, your second test is ready.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** And then... Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:14]** And you see a Fusion Fizz cam in front of you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Drink it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** I drink it?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** What?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Do you reach over to pick it up?

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** Yeah.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:26]** You pick it up, and in your head, you hear, Please open the can and enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** I do that.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** And as you open it up...

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** As you bring it up, you see that it's a flavor that you never got.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:41]** Everyone always wanted this flavor, and they only released a limited release of it.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** You just didn't get it.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** It's called Star Coolant.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** It's a rare flavor.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:51]** It's just supposed to be super energetic and relaxing all at the same time.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:55]** And I'm going to take us out of initiative order for a second because you have now tricked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:01]** I still have a feeling we're going to have to fight this thing either way, even if we did all these tests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Your skeptical nature gets the best of you, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** It does.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Do you want to put it into your chemilizer?

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** I will give you a bit more information.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Great.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:17]** Because your chemilizer already picked that up last time, you realize that there are also nanites in this fusion fizz.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** And what's interesting is that when you grabbed it, it's room temperature.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Makes sense.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Wasn't chilled.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:27]** But it says on the side, new and improved self-chilling technology.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:32]** And as you pop it open...

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** It's like the ones that carbonate themselves as soon as you open it.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** There's this thick vapor that pours out.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** It smells very overpowering of fruit.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:46]** And the can becomes chilled in your tentacle.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:56]** And you realize that you have something that... Again, this is also psychotropic.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** You will get a bonus...

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:04]** to your will saves and saving throws against fatigue and exhaustion.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** But... For the rest of the book.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:20]** But for the rest of the hour, you're also going to have a slight penalty to attack rolls, perceptions, and anything that takes more than a standard action for you to complete.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** If I drink this.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** If you drink it.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** And since you're not drinking it...

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** Or if you don't drink it, the monitor will say something.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** So what do you do?

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** I'm going to pretend to drink it.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** Can I do a sleight of hand check?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** You need to make a sleight of hand check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Okay.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:44]** So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, oh, this looks very refreshing.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:49]** And then I'm going to use my chemilizer.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:58]** And I have all these like sort of oily tentacles across my body and these sort of crevices around my neck and, you know, where my mouth hole might be.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:03]** And I'm going to like lean back.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:18]** and sort of obfuscate my view, but I'm just going to be pretending like I'm... And then I'm going to turn maybe and just show one very presented side, but it's really just going to be pouring into this little chemilizer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** And I rolled a natty 19 plus 11 on my sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** Will doesn't fail.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** Will doesn't fail.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:38]** As it's pouring, you think, this would probably taste good if I took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Yes, so delicious.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** Yes, monitor, it's so great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** As you're doing that, make a reflex save and give yourself a plus two.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:53]** Because you are totally in control of the can and any manipulation around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** I actually rolled a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** You rolled a three.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:04]** If you had gotten it, I would have said that you dropped it just as you realized that the remaining nanites are eating away the can.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** Because you're looking at the monitor and you're pouring it and you're like, this is great.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** But because you rolled a three, you're going to take one point of acidity.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** Oh, okay.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Ouch!

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** Why does it got a sting, Monitor?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:22]** And it falls... To the ground.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:29]** You think... These nanites are something that the Greys... It's a wing of research.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Clearly.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Because there's nanites in two of these experiments.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** But you don't have any of the effects from actually taking it.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** It falls to the ground.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** You all are out of initiative order.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** And the Monitor... Says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:48]** Thank you for your compliance, test subjects.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Have a great day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Power's back down.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Yeah, great work, test subjects.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** And Rick lowers his gun and walks out the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:11]** Nico's going to look over at Dr. O'Kane here, and he's going to be thinking, he's going to say out loud, like, what's his problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:14]** I could guess.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** I don't need to.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:22]** I think he's very conscious about his body, what he puts in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** He's an android.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** He's literally a machine.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** I understand where he's coming from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:34]** I mean, I wouldn't want anything gunking up my oily parts.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** And then I just sort of slither off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** Mika's gonna say, I don't have any oily parts.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:43]** I got organic parts, which are more fragile than mechanical parts.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** And I got to say... I'm not in the room.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** I don't know.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** He's just talking to himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** The camera zooms in on Nico.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** And we zoom out.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** And he's like, guys.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** Is there anything I can do with the communicator?

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** You want to go back in and see if you can?

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** This thing right on top left.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** You need to control it with the computer module.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** So you need to break into that computer module to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** All right.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** I'll just do that real quick.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** I'll take 20 maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Well... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Nico assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:15]** I don't think you can take 20 on computer checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** That depends.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** That depends.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:24]** So I think you could take 20 on a hacking check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** I succeed the DC anyway.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** But yeah, it's good to know this.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** You succeed it as if you weren't taking 20?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** I mean, I got a 28.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** Plus, like, Nick's thing.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** It was 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** Now I just want to know for me.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** Yeah, no, I want to know, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** I'm trying to look.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:50]** Take 20 says, when you have plenty of time to devote to a skills task and that task has no adverse effect upon failure.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:56]** So if it is a hack with a failure thing, the GM might rule that you could take 20 on the skill check.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** It's similar to taking 10.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:02]** Taking 20 means you are making multiple attempts at the task until you get it right.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:06]** It also assumes that you are failing many times before you succeed.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** Taking 20 typically takes 20 times as long as attempting a single check.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** It would usually take two minutes.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** So, yeah.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:21]** If the hack failure would have been some kind of trap, then you cannot take 20 on it.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Okay.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Yeah.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:25]** But that's up to the GM to tell you whether or not you can do it.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:25]** Makes sense.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:25]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Cool.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Thank you.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Well done, Kev.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Very nice.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Thank you.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:35]** I don't think you can take 20 on this, but you already nailed the check because you're trying to access a secure firewall module.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** But you did access it.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:46]** This is a comm unit that has been built specifically for Grace.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** And it's pretty big.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:57]** They've essentially constructed these telepathic comms that are tuned to their thought patterns.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** You've never seen anything like this.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]** This would be a very deep black market, gray market channel comm.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:12]** in order to even know that somebody had heard of somebody else that had maybe found one that they thought was it.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:28]** And you realize that it only connects to receivers that also have a gray commune, which then would let the receiver know of a message coming in.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** Now you could also use mind link.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:35]** If you didn't have telepathy, it's the same effect.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:56]** And this, again, because the grays are so good at manipulating technology, this is powerful enough that it could communicate with any other gray comm unit over an entire planet from this one unit.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** Nick, hold on.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:02]** The other thing is that you think...

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:06]** Well, let me see if there are any other comm units around.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:14]** And I'll just tell you that you ping two other comm units somewhere in the vicinity of where you are now.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** At least two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:21]** So Niko looks over at Hirz and says, do we want to see if we can find the other comm units?

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:32]** If this thing's capable of reaching out to any other thing across the planet, one, it suggests that we are actually on a planet and not on a spaceship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** You don't know that from what he said.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** It just has the capability to do that.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** It's not an indication of where it is going.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** It's an indication of what it could do.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Okay.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:45]** I'm just going to clarify that because I don't want that to... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** So Niko's...

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Also, were you touching Gears during this?

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Is this why you know this?

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:56]** Yeah, because we're still having that weird moment where he's touching my forehead.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:57]** Okay.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** It's not weird, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:59 - 01:02:59]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** It's a good moment.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Gears, what do you think?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:16]** Well, I mean, that's cool to know for maybe some future stuff, but can't really do anything with it at the moment besides alert our presence, which would not be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:24]** If I can find a workbench or have some time to work on this, I might be able to get us some working comms for us where we might be able to figure out a little bit more about things.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** Maybe do some remote hacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:31]** I'm just going to say that in order to get this out, it would be like a huge construction level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** Yeah, you're worried about carrying freaking...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:35 - 01:04:02]** stuff in the pastor room man you want to carry this around it's like two refrigerators worth at least and i will say that the technology will just take a while like it would take a long time to go through it i'm not trying to say you can't you can maybe take a crystal or something to that would benefit you later this is a piece or a portion of it uh but you've never seen technology like this especially not that would that you can communicate with telepic telepathically


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:09]** Well, Nico wants to see what he can scavenge from the computer terminal itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** The computer terminal?

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** Or the comms device?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** The comms device, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Okay, it's a working comms device.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:20]** So I'm going to say that to pull something out that you want, it would probably be DC-20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** Engineering.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** I'll assist with that.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:25]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]** 11 or higher, 11 or higher.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Yes!

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** 18.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** On the die.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** Plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** You are able to get... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:41]** Plus 9.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** 27, 29.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** Okay.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:44]** 28, 30?

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** 30.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** No, 29.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:51]** You are able to get one of the crystals out of it.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** And as you're doing this, the comms device goes down.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:56]** You're taking away components of it.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** It goes down.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:05]** You are able to grab a crystal, one of the smoky fog like crystals that are inside.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:13]** And you're also able to grab a few of these silver and gold wires that are part of it and just make a quick note.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:15]** I think it went like this.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** I think it went like this.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:20]** Quick schematic that you put into your comps.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** That's it.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:27]** That will mechanically later on, any sort of investigation into this will give you some insight.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:32]** It might give you a chance to explain to somebody, this is how I think it worked.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** It would take some time.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** They could maybe make it yourself.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Yeah.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** And that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:37]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** All right, cool.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** What's this thing on the far right before we go?

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** I'm just trying to remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** I can't think of it.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** That's the heat sink.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** That's the heat sink.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Okay.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:48]** Rick, Dr. Okay, here's Nico.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Here's Nico.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** You guys are walking past the monitor.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:51]** It's powered down.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:52]** Yeah.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** What do you guys do?

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:57]** I'm assuming you're going back into the room with the vending machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:03]** Well, before here's goes away, Nico's going to be like, so are you going to like stop touching my forehead here?

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:12]** Like, I know I asked you to do it, but I mean, I mean, there's no more reason to touch my very, very ungrateful, very ungrateful.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** Here's the shame, man.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:18]** It's just, it's not every day where you ask someone on purpose to touch your forehead.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** Like at least see where I'm coming from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:25]** Here's your size, size and shakes his head and walks out the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** I don't deal with telepaths on a daily basis, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** A bit too much for you, huh?

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** Maybe I'll take it easy the second time.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** You can't handle it.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** Hey, come on.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:48]** As you two enter the room, Rick is going to just say out loud, like, is there any reason to enter this other room before we head forward?

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Or should we just try to get off of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** I think we should just try to get out.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Try to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:54]** Done.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:58]** He pulls out his dueling sword and like, let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:59 - 01:06:59]** All right.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** Rick Scott has his gun up facing the double doors.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:06]** He's pointing down that hallway and waiting for somebody to... Chad, you want to take this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:07]** Hey, man.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Yeah.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** Hey, hey.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:14]** About that... Uh-huh.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** About that thing I... What did I ask you about?

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:17]** What?

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:18]** I wanted it.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** I wanted something of yours.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** The glasses.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** Never mind.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Dude, those look so rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** Yeah, Chad, after this, I'll let you borrow them.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** For real.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Yeah, we're good.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:34]** Goes over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** Didn't you lose them to the fifth dimension?

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Wait, did I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Oh, I forgot.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** God dang it.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** You did lose them to the fifth dimension.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** Chad will forget.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:44]** It's fine.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:47]** Yeah, it's all right.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** All right.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:52]** You go through, and you're going to go and open that door.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** Yeah, Chad does.

**[01:07:54 - 01:08:04]** That door is unlocked as Chad walks up and punches it with his burrito that he still hasn't finished.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:13]** Don't rush me, man.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:19]** I would take a second to point out, if I'm playing a video game or something, I would explore absolutely every room.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:19]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:25]** But, like, Rick... I'm trying to play Rick's mind, and, like, Rick just wants to get out of here.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Well, I would too.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:32]** Plus, like, plus in a video game, you could save and restart and not have your character die, but that's not the case here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** That's right.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** And that's why Starfinder's great.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:42]** The door... Both metaphysically and in the game.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Yeah.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:50]** It's opened, and you see... I'm not going to reveal it just yet, but you see a long hallway...

**[01:08:53 - 01:09:19]** lights are flickering there's another vibration in the ground as you realize that the hallway is probably at least 6200 feet it looks like as the lights flicker you can see to the right another hallway juts off you can see at least two more sets of double doors on the left far down the hallway and

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:28]** You can't quite tell, but it also, there are two additional hallways on the right, one in the middle and one at the far end, and you can't quite see down at the far end.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:40]** The ceilings are flickering, casting shadows everywhere as there's disjointed infrastructure, beams, wiring, hanging down.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** What do you want to do?

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** reveal it as we're talking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:53]** Nico wants to do an engineering check to kind of see what these wires were supposed to be doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:57]** I'll just tell you they're just wires that are part of the facility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:05]** I guess Nico's wondering if there's any kind of life support systems that are gone or... You don't think so.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:10]** That there's cooling gone or if there's any toxic gas.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Give me a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:33]** engineering check then because that's more along the lines of like traps and stuff like that okay so that's gonna be a 12 okay 12 doesn't seem like it seems like it's stable atmosphere you breathe in the air again it seems the same as the air that you're in now that you're breathing now so nika's gonna go here

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Nico steps up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:35]** Rick follows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** Rick19 steps up.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** Here's Dr. Okay.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:43]** He just tells Chad to just kind of go out forward because he can trigger traps just in case there is one.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:48]** He goes to the... Sorry, so what is Chad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:50]** Let's bring Chad... Yeah, let's bring Chad back.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:50]** Okay.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:52]** All right.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** Dr. K steps forward.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** Chad is an unseen servant, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:55]** Unseen servant.

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:57]** So can he tell you what he sees?

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** Is he like a scout?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:03]** That is a really good... I was wondering that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:05]** Or what was Barnus called?

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** A familiar?

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** Is he similar to a familiar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:15]** That's a really good... It's also probably been... You don't have too much time left with Chad before you need to recap.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:15]** True, true.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** That's my guess.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** So... Yeah.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:18]** Yeah.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:44]** let's visit that in a second because as you step into the hallway there's a weird sensation here's you're not in the hallway you're still back in the other room but something in the back of your mind again the telepathy something now that the doors are open there's like a weird consistent rhythmic sensation

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:45]** in the back of your head.

**[01:11:46 - 01:12:11]** You almost brush it off because looking down at the end of the hallway, there is a weird sense of static electricity as you start to feel your skin tingle as if the very air around you was beginning to crackle with static energy.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:19]** Rick, your robotic senses feel like they're misfiring slightly, as if you were almost intoxicated.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Your eyes can't focus.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:24]** Doctor, okay, your skin feels dry and crackly.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:32]** Here's your antennae stick up straight on end, and Nico, the back of your neck, the hairs stick up, and you shiver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:35]** Nico's gonna say, Rick, get back.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Get back now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** Don't move.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:38]** Yet.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:43]** Because 30 feet down the hallway, before you

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:58]** Three points of green light begin vibrating and appearing in front of you, growing larger.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:07]** Like there's a rip in quantum space-time until there's this loud snap that occurs.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:14]** And you start to see three odd shapes move out of the space where the light once was.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:19]** Something's apparating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** Something's ripping through dimension.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:23]** It's not just apparating.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** Someone's tearing through something that they shouldn't be.
