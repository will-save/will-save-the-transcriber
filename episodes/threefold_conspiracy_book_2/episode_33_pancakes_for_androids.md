**[00:00:00 - 00:00:05]** Last time on We'll Save, Greys.

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:13]** These creatures are known for their extremely advanced technology and cultural secrecy.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:25]** Our group found themselves in the technological ruins of three dead Greys, while they continued to find out more about their current environment.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:40]** A search into the databanks revealed that the Greys had been experimenting with demonic summoning and manipulation, infrasonic experiments, biological experiments, and polymorphic weapons.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** What lies in store for our adventurers?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** I'm there.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** I'm not there yet.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Can we have a live report?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** I think it's great.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** It is.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** We'll say.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:58]** We're going on scene with Kevin Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** That's all the cars going around the loop.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Gen Con driver, Kevin Decker.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** How is it out there on the track, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:12]** Oh wow, it was so crazy, it was so fast, going around in circles and everything else, but now that we're here, I'm so excited, I'm gonna get in there and I'm gonna play so many games!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:18]** And we're going back live to the track, Delta Green is coming in ahead of Call of Cthulhu, who will win in this year's Gen Con?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** I think everybody loses in Delta Green, that's the rule, right?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** Oh yeah, that's right, so Delta Green car automatically loses.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** It just explodes right at the flag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:30]** It's gonna be like a four hour game and you have to be dead by the end of it, like, that's the rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** I hear it's scary.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Very scary.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** It could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** But this is a good question for our fans.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** Anybody listening, if you're listening this week, as this episode drops, are you going to be at Gen Con?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** And if you are, hit us up on social media.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** We want to know.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** And then you can look for us there.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** You know what we look like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:55]** Well, we don't... I mean... Maybe if our IT guy gets on it and puts our pictures up on the website.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** Maybe we had some pictures to put up.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I've asked many times.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** This might be the fact that we need pictures.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** I mean, our social media links, our accounts are linked.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** We have pictures up already online.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Here is the thing, though.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:40]** You need to, like, we will post what we'll be wearing and we'll have some, you know, we'll save gear.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** You guys played Dominion?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** Shirt.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** And if you see that, then come talk to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It's a cool car game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Yeah, I do want to play Dominion.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** But if you see that hat while you're there, just be like, hey, I don't know who you are.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** I was told to talk to you if you have this hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** Wait, which hat?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** The Will Save hat.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Oh, the Will Save hat.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** I'll say this.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:06]** If I'm wearing a Will Save hat and somebody walks up and they can roll a natural 20 on the first roll without a loaded dice, I might get in the hat.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** How are you going to detect?

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** I might even sign it.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:13]** My signature might be worth... Fuck you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Are you going to murder them and then take your hat back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Kev, come on.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** You guys ruined all the fun.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Yes, we ruined all the fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:29]** Wholesome good time giving away good stuff.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** And you're like, you're going to murder him afterwards?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** These are quality hats, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** They're going to see me in the hat and be like, no, fuck that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** This sounds like an agency.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** It reminds me of Three's Company theme, though.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** Gotta knock on the door.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** I'll be waiting for you.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** That's a perfect theme for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** You're just waiting on the other side of the door.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** And then at the very end, Nick shoots them and says, you're a liability.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** That's what happens.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Stepbrothers 2008.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** You're a liability.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Well, let's clarify.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Kev's not the murder bot.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** Kevin has never killed anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** Directly.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** Ever.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** I have never been involved in a murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** It's a fact.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Like in real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:15]** That's exactly what somebody who has been involved in a murder would say on a podcast.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** That's exactly what somebody would say.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:21]** And this is the moment that we cross over with true crime podcasts.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** So if you want a true crime podcast, message us.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:28]** Because we are now a case study for you.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** In which we were harboring a murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** Yeah, Kevin, like, everything you just said, that's very normal.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** It's normal for people not to kill other people.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** Like, so that's something that a non-human would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** I don't know, man.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** I grew up in Hood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Did you?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Where?

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Which Hood was this?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** The Shadow Puppet Hood?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Rialto.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Rialto?

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** Where Shadow Puppets are currency.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** You mean, like, oh, yeah.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:53]** You had to, like, do Shadow Puppets to, like, get your drugs and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Like Kobayashi.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I mean, you're really good at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** You saved the town.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:08]** I feel like that would be a cool comic if a shadow puppet monster came to take over Rialto and the only person who could save them was young Kevin Decker with his shadow puppet skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** And he had to do a shadow puppet shadow standoff with Kobayashi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:17]** You did the hand signals and then the shadow puppet became real?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** I could cast shadow puppets.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** That would be your superpower.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** As long as I held my hand in the right shape.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** So if you disabled my hands, then I'd be out of luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Hey, so question.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** What's going to be your wake-up time for Gen Con?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** I'm feeling a good, clean 7 a.m.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:37]** maybe workout and then somehow get off whatever hangover I have and then just show up on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** 7 a.m.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** is probably about the time I'll wake up.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** 7 a.m.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Eastern time.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** Got it.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** So 6?

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** Yeah, for me, which is going to be 8 for you guys.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** I'm not going to room with you at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** I'm rooming with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** I got my own room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** So I'm waking up at 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** I forgot that Dr. O.K.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** gets his own room.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** gets his own room.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** He goes back to sleep.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** I'm going to get up at 8 maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:07]** Well, actually, it depends on the type of year because Indianapolis does not do daylight savings.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Fun fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** Well, will we be there?

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Don't throw glitches into the system.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** No, no, no.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Is September 16th?

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Now I have to know.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** Is that this week after we... Because it's go forward, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:25]** This is high math and I just want to roll dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** Indiana now observes DST.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Since when?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** What's DST?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** There's only two states, right?

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** Arizona and Indiana.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** Wait, how long has Indiana actually observed daylight savings?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** As of April 2nd, 2006.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Rough.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** That's a long time, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** It's been like over a decade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Yes.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** It's a while, man.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** That's before they ever, I don't know, what did Indiana do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** What's their claim to fame?

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Oh, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** Bobby Knight, the Hoosiers, Reggie...

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** And before Hoosiers.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Before Reggie Miller.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Before Hoosiers.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Actually, around the end of Reggie Miller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** What about you, Kelly?

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I mean, probably eight.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** I mean, unless there's a reason that I need to be up earlier, then I'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** Whatever.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** We're getting up.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** We're going to Gen Con.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** It's going to be a great time.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Bam.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Bam.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Mimosas.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Mimosas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:20]** I don't know what that means, but... I like your beer point.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** You wanted to know what I'm going to be doing at five in the morning?

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Drinking mimosas.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** Damn straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Actually, hold on.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** I have a little caveat on that.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** In college, I invented this drink.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** John knows it.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** He might have had it.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** It's called the Bluegrass.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** It's a drink that I invented.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** It is J&B Scotch Whiskey.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** amaretto, sweet and lime juice, and blue curacao with a little bit of cinnamon in there.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:55]** You will get so messed up, you won't even know you were messed up because the flavors are so nice, sweet, and a little bit sour, it completely washes away the J&B Scotch Whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** That sounds great.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** You should make some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** I'll try it.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** You should be a spokesperson for J&B.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Why J&B specifically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** It's because of what I had on hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:08]** I used to call my college cocktail invention a haterade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:34]** instead of a screwdriver which was vodka and orange juice i would do um sailor jerry's and orange juice i like sailor jerry's a spanner wrench nice so haterade sounds but if you ask a bartender for a spanner wrench they're like it's literally whatever fruit you got laying around like sangria yep with powdered gatorade and everclear and it's delicious we called that skip and go naked


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Skipping on naked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** Yeah, skip and go naked.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** It was lemonade, Bud Light, and vodka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Called an Irish shipwreck?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** I've heard about that.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** I don't know what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** I've heard of an Irish shipwreck.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** I don't know what an Irish car bomb is.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** I've heard of the Irish shipwreck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:55]** Yeah, I didn't know that it wasn't a drink per se.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** It's very niche, apparently.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** But if you know about it, tell us.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:04]** It's like a whiskey sour, but you have a Luxardo cherry syrup in there.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** So it's like super berry whiskey sour.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** And it has to be like an Irish whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Fun fact about me.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** I actually went to bartending school for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** So did I. What?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Did you go to ABC?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Yeah.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** Yeah.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** I would say ABC.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** What?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** ABC.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:28]** This is another stepbrother reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:32]** I actually have the ABC bartending manual in my office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** You got to make six drinks in nine minutes?

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** No, you do way more than that.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Nine drinks in six minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Is that the one that's in Hawthorne?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** There's a chain of them.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** They're actually all over the U.S.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I went to the one in the south.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Do you know what, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** There is one above the In-N-Out on Venice Boulevard.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** But I didn't go to that one.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** I went to the one in Pasadena.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** And then I worked at Wolfgang Puck for like three years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Will does have a very interesting history.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:04]** But we will get into that next episode when we talk about most interesting jobs that you've had.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** Excluding playing on a TTRPG actual play podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:14]** Excluding commanding a nuclear submarine's nuclear power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** That's the only job I've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I wonder who that could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:21]** I don't know if that's the most interesting job I've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Let's talk about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** So last episode, you guys decided to go through...

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:44]** This hub of computers and thought, all right, after all this noxious air has left this space and here's bravely put forth his life, ran in and sucked out all that noxious air.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:49]** You all have found three bodies who you found out to be greys.

**[00:11:50 - 00:12:01]** These short creatures with long limbs, long fingers, large heads, opaque black eyes, slit-like nose and mouth.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:08]** Dead with some sort of hole exploded in the back of their head.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:14]** You also find computer modules.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Four of them.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:20]** One of them required pretty high access.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Couldn't quite get it.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:30]** The other three, you find out, are related to some sorts of experiments that are probably...

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:54]** nearby seems like they're connected to computers nearby one of them seems to be about some sort of frequency of like infrasound with a low frequency sound one of them is about some sort of biological testing and then one of them seems to be about some sort of weapon testing some sort of weapon that seems to be able to mutate

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:00]** And with that, in this lab that is clearly ruined, the ground is shaking.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** The lights are flickering.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:10]** This seems like an unstable place in which beams, ceiling tiles, rock, electricity seems to be sparking everywhere.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** There is a door to the north and a door to the south.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:20]** And the door to the south was covered in rubble.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** And you should refresh your World 20.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Well, because I've moved you over.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:41]** The door to the south had a lot of rubble in front of it, and while the computers were being successfully and unsuccessfully hacked, Rick single-handedly murdered the rubble.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Yeah.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Get out of here.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** And pulled it out of the way.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Had to be done, man.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** Had to be done.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:54]** And I believe it was Mr. Rick19 who opened the door to the hallway to the south.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** You saw a blue light coming out through the door.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** I'm going to reveal it here.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:09]** And as part of this blue light, you see that as you look in, maybe you don't quite peek in all the way, but you can see that the room extends to the left and to the right.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** It seems to be like a corridor.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Is the wall, like, right ahead of me?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** So the wall ahead of you...

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:25]** has this, like, blue patterns on it that seem to be these, like, complex circuit-like diagrams on that wall.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:36]** And on the other side of that wall, you can see that just barely you can make out two doors, one to your left and one to your right.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:43]** And there seem to be a lot of panels, tubes, strangely shaped metal boxes, and thick cables cover everything.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** That wall.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:48]** The ceiling, you can tell it's the same dull gray stone.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:56]** And there seems to be cracks and dust drifting down from the fissures in the stone.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** What do you do?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** Rick19 is the only person standing in front of this doorway.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Here's Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** and... I'm... Yep.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Dr.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** O.K.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** 's still...

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** We searched the bodies of the greys.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** We found that metal trinket thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:16]** You found what appears to be some sort of a card, but it's malfunctioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:22]** Rick's going to roll perception to see if he can recognize anything down the hallway, specifically creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:31]** Can Dr. Okay look for anything in the room where this card would fit?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Sure, but let's get to that in a sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:33]** Rick?

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** I rolled 14 plus 6 for 20.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** For 20, okay.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:51]** Yeah, maybe there was something interesting about the way that the panels or the blue lines that are iridescent blue kind of radiating off, right?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** There's only one light source in here, as you can see.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** You can't really see too much unless you go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:08]** I picture, like, Rick has his gun up, his big artillery laser up on his shoulder, and he's kind of, like, peeking in and, like, you know, torquing his body into it so he has the gun pointed in the direction he's looking.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** Yeah.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** But he's not, like, stepping into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Got it.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** But he's just kind of leaning over the threshold, looking in.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** Yeah.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** So he'd be able to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Trying to see gun first.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** But I don't want to move my character down there because there's, like, a trap or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:22]** Well, so with your perception, you notice that the door seems to be fine.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** You don't think that there's any laser beam or any sort of trap.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** Across the threshold of the door.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** You didn't activate anything by opening the door.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Okay.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** But as you look over, you kind of put two and two together.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:47]** And it looks like the blue lines seem to land on these two hatches that you didn't really notice before that are next to the doors.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** And they're kind of concealed because they're flush against the wall.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** But you're like, I think that's a hatch door.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** that I could open.

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:00]** Like it seems to be some sort of, you know, panel that I can somehow Jimmy open or pull open somehow across the way from you.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:13]** What did you, I would say, give me maybe a, either an engineering or a physical science check, uh, to see if you know what that would fit in, what that card would fit in.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** 24, 24.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** Pretty.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** You're fairly confident.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** This is some sort of a key card for a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** Okay.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** But there's no, like, doesn't seem like king on it or anything like that.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** That would indicate like, oh, it's for this store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:50]** no and from the doors that you've seen it doesn't seem like like key card acceptors yeah like the the two doors in the in the hub that you're still in they don't need that key card got it some door needs it but not one right here wonder where this leads me behind you rick and i teen has opened the door and is peering in what are the three of you who are still still not there dude


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:58]** Eiko is still kind of, like, buried into whatever technology he's getting from the computer here and whatever he's scavenging.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Okay.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:03]** Also, and he's really caught up on the feeling he got on the computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** But the chamber is shaking, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Occasionally, it's like you feel like... The ground shifts.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** The ground shifts.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** A couple pebbles or things from the ceiling or the wall fall.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Clearly, something's happening somewhere.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** A tremor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** I'm getting nervous about this.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Break 19, do you say anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Do I hear him say that?

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** He's like 25 feet away, whispering.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** No, he's like 15 feet away.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:31]** Do you guys like that this is going on here?

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** No, I don't.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** I am trying to get us out of this area as quickly as possible.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Yeah, let's get the F out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Whatever, guys.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** That's why I opened the door all by myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I'll come back.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** I was trying to find this key card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I'm coming, Rick.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** I'm going to help you with the door, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Yeah, I will help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** There's not a door over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** There's a door to the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** There's a door to the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:22]** door directly behind us i think we should open them one by one though for obvious yeah so rick is gonna march into the room uh almost like 10 10 feet forward and up against the other wall and and check down with both corridors again as far as he can see okay were you doing anything about those patches those panels not yet no he's just he's just making sure there's nothing in here that's gonna attack us okay plus he doesn't have the the no at all to open things does anyone want to give me a culture yeah check or a engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** I do have culture.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** I'll roll, I guess.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Fuck.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** 14 on culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** Well, I got a 9 in engineering.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** That's pretty sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:36]** 9 in engineering, 14 on culture.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** You said 17, Dr. K?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** 17.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** On... Culture.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Got it.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** Hmm.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** So... Sorry, actually, 18.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** 18.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** I read it wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:47 - 00:20:01]** You're pretty sure that the way that these diagram circuits move, the blue lines move, it seems like they're kind of an unlabeled map of...

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** The secondary systems that are in this room, right?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:14]** So all the panels, the tubes, the boxes on the wall, those are these secondary systems that seem to be supporting what's ever in these two doors beyond.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** They seem to be damaged.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** And it seems like these diagrams are a diagram of how that works.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** It's kind of hard to figure it out, though.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** So the diagram is across the whole wall.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** It's the whole wall.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:35]** It's like the equipment is on the wall and the diagram of how it works is like right above it in blue.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** But to try and figure it out would probably take a while.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** It's pretty complex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** And what's at the end of these hallways?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** They just keep going and going and going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** It's just a door at each side of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** There's a door on the opposite wall.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** It's a 10 by probably 60 foot hallway.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** The short walls on each side are just a flat wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** So there's a door right to my right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** And a door to your left.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Okay.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** And then behind you is Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** And at the end of the hallways, it butts off to nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Just a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:12]** So Rick is going to turn to the other... He's kind of already facing them, and he sees these two doors, and he's going to say...

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** This hallway is clear.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:20]** Do you want to proceed ahead, or should we go check the other hallway, the other door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** I think I see something over there.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:27]** Like he points at this purple glowing thing at the end of one end of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** That's just a light.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** Oh, okay.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** It's the same light that's been before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** It's really pretty.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** I'm a bug.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** I like lights.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** Lamp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Brother.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** Lamp.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Someone hold me back.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Please.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** It's like Wreck-It Ralph.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Wreck-It Ralph.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:48]** So, but you probably do see, Rick did probably look at the panels that are in the wall.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** So there are those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** Oh, well, let's try to open them or something.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** I'm down.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Here's goes to open one of the panels.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Okay.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** It's these like things here, right, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** No, those are doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Those are doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Yeah.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** It's right on the inside of each door.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** That you see that.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:11]** So Rick's actually going to step out and into the room behind where Nico's still hanging out.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Okay.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** What?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** Why?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** So you guys can get to these panels and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** Do we want to try and, what are these panels?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** They're flush panels against the wall.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** They seem like they're concealed.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** They're meant to be concealed, but Rick noticed them.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** I will try to open one of them.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** Same here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:33]** But can I detect if there's like a trap or booby trap?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** Absolutely.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** You want to do the same?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Yes.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Nico, what are you thinking while this is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** 27.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** Nice.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** So Nico's kind of lost in thought over there.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:47]** He's just kind of really having a euphoric experience over here with the technology.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** It's kind of changing him.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** It's kind of, he's saying, it's just so simple.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** It's so appealing.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** He's looking at hypergeometry.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** He's losing his mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:08]** Picture that meme with all the math numbers and shapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:11]** Everything's possible if you have family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Stepbrothers 2006.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** 2008.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Stepbrothers.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** That's the part where Vin Diesel comes in.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** So, Dr.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** O.K., you don't notice any... Booby traps?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** Any traps on the thing.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Did you do a perception check, too?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I did, but it was only like nine.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** You don't think that there's any traps either, so.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Yeah.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** I don't think that at least.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** You're distracted by the light.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Super confident.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:46]** You kind of both run your tentacle or finger across the seam, trying to reach, feel down where you can kind of get something in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** All right.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** That sound is too good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** Yeah, that was good.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Looks like there's no traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:03]** I pictured Dr. Okay running his finger one way and then he was running his finger the other.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:10]** And then they touch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** Just feel that little static shock.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Woof.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Woof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Yes.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** I've never seen you in this light before, Doctor.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** That purple light.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:27]** That flickering purple light in an unstable place.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** That's good.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** So you kind of pull out the panel.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** And inside there's one shelf.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** So there's something up here and something down here.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:44]** The thing on top of the shelf seems to be this box that you can tell immediately.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** It's transparent.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:48]** It's 500 UPBs.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Nice!

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Damn!

**[00:24:50 - 00:25:13]** which have we seen before what we have not talked about this universal polymer base polymer base you can use it to build your your starship up not that we have starship but we might someday we can use this i think yeah they're pretty interchangeable with credits right so like think of them as like very very tiny multi-function components like i'm trying to think of

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:34]** what that would be like if you had a bunch of really tiny maybe raspberry pies or something where like it could do anything that you want it to it's maybe like maybe the size of a grain of rice and it's like it's like an ultimate nano yeah but ship controller mechanism


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:39]** It's more like modular adaptation of physical things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Any technology.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** You could even put it in a data pad, if I'm not mistaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Right, John?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** You can do a lot of stuff with it.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** And that's why it's so popular is because across technologies, across cultures, across trade hubs.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** It's like Dogecoin.

**[00:25:49 - 00:26:10]** yeah it's like you could use it for anything but the thing is that it's like it's it's really popular too because unlike cred sticks like it you know it's pretty it has utility it's pretty untraceable okay so i like untraceable yeah think about this the value of a packed world's credit is based on the economic utility of a single upb


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:14]** So we have 500 UPVs inside of a box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** Yeah, and it's about 500 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** How difficult is this box to open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Well, no, no.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** It's not in the box.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** It is the box.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:29]** The files are in the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:32]** So that's all that's behind these bolt panels?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** So the bottom...

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:42]** Kind of built into the wall is a Mark II culinary synthesizer from the Armory.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Thank you, Paizo, from the Starfinder Armory.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** It's a pretty sweet book.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** And it does exactly what it says it does.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** It synthesizes culinary stuff.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:58]** It synthesizes culinary stuff as I stall and look for it.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:02]** So a culinary synthesizer, think of it as a small cube.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** There's a hatch on one side.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Here's the thing.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:12]** The UPBs are used to create the price of the meal that you want with a culinary synthesizer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Boo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Fuck that.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** It uses UPBs to create the meal that you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** How much UPBs does it cost to make just one pancake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** It's whatever the cost of one pancake is in UPB.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** I'm asking you, what is the cost of one pancake?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Probably less than one UPB.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** I hope so.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** So you can get at least 500 out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** I want 500 pancakes for one UPV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Here's the thing.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** This culinary synthesizer is built into the wall.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:37]** If you guys want to try and pull it out without messing it up, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** I just want the goods.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** I don't really see what the point of it is.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** I don't really see it being too useful, the culinary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Wait, how big is it?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** It sounds pretty useful.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** We could try to rip it out.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** I'm an android.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** I don't really eat a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** Apparently you just want pancakes.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** We can help you get that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** There's one in each.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Smoke and a flamp jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Smoking a flapjack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** Smoking a pancake.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Smoking a pancake.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Smoking a flapjack.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** Stepbrothers.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** Flapjack and a sausage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** All right, can we come back to the game?

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Yes.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:18]** So each hatch has 500 of these UPVs.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Each hatch.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** 200.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** Sorry.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** How many hatches are there?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Two 500s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Yes.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Okay, we have two.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Each hatch has 500 UPBs.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** One of them has culinary synthesizer.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** So that's all the cabinets in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** So we got a G of these UPBs.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** A grand.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** Dope.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** A Benjamin.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Wait, no, not a Benjamin.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** A Benny is only... Ten Benz.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Ten Benz.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Ten Benz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Benny Benjamin?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** You asshole.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** We don't have Benzies.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Let's try to take it off the... You want to take it off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Yeah, we don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Yeah, let's take it off.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Okay.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Whoever's going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:58]** I have a... I'm quite skilled.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** I have plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** I will roll to assist.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** I'm rolling really low today.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** I only got a ten.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** To do it or to assist?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Well, to assist.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** So plus two.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Yeah, plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** I'm going to need it.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Rick does not assist.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** 13 on the die.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** So you got a 15.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** No, I got a 21.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** So 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** That's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Yeah, you're actually able to pry it out.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:25]** It takes you... It doesn't take that long at all.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** It takes about 20 seconds.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** You're able to find the clamps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:33]** No, if I just take this little part here, I think, yeah, it'll come apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** Rick is like, I think you should probably... Wait, does that make pancakes?

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Would you be making pancakes?

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** Making pancakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** The pancake arc.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** The pancake arc.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** That's actually the name of the book, too.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** I knew it!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** All the titles are going to be pancake-based.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** Pancake.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Yeah, that's how we're going to do it.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** All flapjack.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Nick is not amused.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** All right, so what do you guys want to do?

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** You have this culinary synthesizer.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** You have 1,000 UPBs.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** You're standing in this hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** You're ground shaking.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** What are you thinking?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Is there anything else?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Are there any doors in this hallway?

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Just the hatch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:12]** No, there are the two doors right there.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Oh.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** Yeah, there's a door to your left and a door to your right in the middle of the walls.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** What kind of door are they?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** Seems to be like a single panel flat metal door.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:43]** here's just gonna check out the one on the lower right okay he's gonna follow sneak question mark about this i guess still i'm gonna have my weapons drawn give me a stealth roll here's ah geez it's it's an eight it's an eight okay yeah you walk up and you kind of trip on some rubble that's on the ground as you come up uh rick what are you thinking and uh nico what are you thinking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** Making pancakes, making pancakes.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** I was waiting for you to go.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** I was waiting on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** I was waiting on you to go.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** All right.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:59]** So Rick's going to step back out and say, hold on one minute.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** I think we should check on Nico.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** And then he's going to turn back and be like, are you okay?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Are you coming?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** It's so simple.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Nico.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Nico, are you?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** And he's going to walk over to Nico and grab his shoulder.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Nico, are you okay?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** What has gotten into you?

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:24]** I just, that was, what was I doing?

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:34]** Rick's going to look into his eyes and he's going to take out his comm unit, which acts as a flashlight, and he's going to just shine it across his eyeballs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:40]** Nico's just going to react kind of little, what are you doing?

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** I was just sitting down at the computer here to hack into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** I'm just making sure you're okay.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** You seemed dazed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:55]** I mean, I still got to hack into this, but I mean... We had finished that several minutes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Nico, we're moving on.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** We need to get out of here before this place collapses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Nico, come with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Did I succeed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Rick's just going to walk away.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** He doesn't know if you succeeded or not.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** He wasn't involved in that.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** He was kicking rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:32]** nico's now literally just standing there alone a little bit just kind of like and as rick gets the door he's gonna turn back and say come on nico now very slowly he's just gonna be he's gonna walk over he's like this is some trip dr okay here's do you want to proceed or should we clear out the other doorway proceed i want to check these doors out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** Where are we going to proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** There's another... There are two doors to the south on the wall where you're standing.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** But then there's also the door across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** Oh yeah, let's just check these ones real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Copy that.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Move ahead.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** I'll take the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Well, we can just breach one at a time.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** Just in case.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** For what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** I don't know.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** What if you open the door and there's a giant monster in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Well, yeah, fair enough.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** If it's like the large room, I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** So who's doing what?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:05]** So Rick is going to go stand by the other door with his gun ready.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:10]** The door's closed, and he's going to wait for Dr. Oki to open the door on his side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** I thought here's what's going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** You two are together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** I was stacking up behind here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:19]** Nico's going to look over at Rick19.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** He's going to be like, why do you have your gun out?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** Where have you been for the last four days?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** That's exactly my point.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:32]** We don't even know if we're on this ship right now, if this is just some bad trip.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** I'm not convinced.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** I have no idea where I am.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:40]** Apparently, I have no memory of where I was the last 20 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** You, of all people, were the closest to death.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** Do you not remember the Barkest almost eating you alive?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** Of course I remember that, but I still don't know if...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** that happen or this is some messed up experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:54]** Whatever the case may be, it was real enough at the time.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Correct?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** I guess.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** Whatever trip you were having, I'm not going to let it risk my life.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Do you understand me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Whoa, hold on there.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** Hey, easy there, Rick.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** It's all good, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** We've been through a lot.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** Everybody's looking out for each other.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** You're fine, man.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Just take out your gun.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Just take it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:19]** Just take out the gun and point it in a safe direction.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** Until we need you to point it at an unsafe thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:51]** nico's gonna start chuckling to himself and he's just gonna be he's gonna be do you need a boost here's under any other circumstance that would be the most threatening thing in the world yet somehow you find a way to make humor of it that being said though i can't help but feel just out of it did i did apparently it's been a long time did i actually do something to that computer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** You and I hacked it, and we had mixed success, but we took out some of the modules.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Now we have them with us.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** All right, so now we're trying to go through here and open these doors and figure out what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:10]** There are more pressing issues, but it does concern me, you know, as a doctor.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Not your physician, obviously.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** I don't want to be your, you know.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** He's not liable.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Your PCP.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:24]** Yeah, but, you know, you should definitely follow up with your primary and, you know, take it easy.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** But for now, we need you to be in the fight.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Is that going to be okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** I think I can manage.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:36]** And Nico's just going to take out his pistol, but the pistol in his hand is just going to feel a little bit heavier than his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Dang.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** What is that about?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** He got weaker?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** He's lost strength?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** No, it's... Lost resolve, maybe.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:53]** Have you guys ever experienced that feeling where it's just kind of like you feel out of it, and even objects that you usually carry with such strength and vigor, you pick it up.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** It just feels a little bit heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** You're talking about a totem and an inception?

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** I know what you mean.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** You're like no longer quick fire?

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Is that what you're telling us?

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** Are you lost in a dream within a dream?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Slightly lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Take out your totem and spin it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** Good stuff.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** This is great.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:15]** And now we have sufficient tension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Sufficient tension.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** So what's this move here?

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** You've got Rick standing in front of the door to the bottom left, and here he's standing in front of the door to the bottom right.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Nico.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** What's the plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** Go stack up behind Rick, and we can breach these doors together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** Well, here's what wanted to stealthily open it, but he rolled a low roll, so he didn't do that.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** But I guess he opened it while doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Okay, so you open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** Nico's also going to take out his dueling sword and have it in his other hand.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Leisurely.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Leisurely.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** And then he's going to whisper over to Rick19,

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** I don't mean anything by taking this sword out, all right?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Don't feel threatened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** Whatever you say, sedate shot.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:56]** I'm just looking up synonyms for slow down.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** Sloth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** I like the way this is.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:07]** Yeah, but I really like this party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** I got some good things going.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:13]** No, out of all seriousness, like Rick will say, like, just stay behind me and don't shoot me in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Thank you for the vote of confidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** Rick, bottom left door, standing in front.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Nico behind him.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Here's bottom right door.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Point of order.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** The door is open.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Oh, shit.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:29]** Yeah, I should have prepared in time.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** Oh, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:52]** gonna say we're actually teamed up wrong okay because yeah i see what you're saying so for for our listeners nick and rick are on one side of the map and dr okay and here's on the other side of the map here's can supercharge rick's weapon well here's can supercharge anybody's weapon right but there's no real benefit to supercharging my weapon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:10]** no it still adds the same d6 so how many is it 46 46 oh it'll add 46 to your weapon like it does that to any weapon it's not supercharged his uh death sticks it'll i think it's supercharged it can do melee as well correct what's up it can do melee weapons too right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** I will have to check that out.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** I will check that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** In any case, I think we're misbalanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** I agree.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** We are not in an optimal setting.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** But it's fine.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Move ahead.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Door's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Door's open.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** It's too late now.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** It looks like it'll do melee weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** The door's open.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I don't know why it didn't... There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Just the one door open.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Right.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Rick has not opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Here's open the door.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** And inside, you can see one purple light in the ceiling.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Oh, God.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Illuminates the disarray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Rick's getting distracted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** In this room.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Workstations here have been wrecked.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Cubicles damaged.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Chairs broken, overturned.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** And terminals smashed.

**[00:38:51 - 00:39:20]** as well broken glass is scattered across the floor from shattered transparent cylinders that form a jagged line down the lab center each has the twisted remains of a robotic arm attached to the ceiling above it and smashed and mangled electronics connect the arms to the bottom three of the cylinders have misshapen fleshy lumps in them

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:34]** And glistening, like, puce goo containing strips of weird skin form streaks across much of the floor and the south wall across from the door.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** There's streaks of goo.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:47]** You can see here from that light there that it looks to be kind of green and then has this weird brown-reddish tint to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:47 - 00:40:11]** grass can i um i'm gonna step in you step in and observe and can i do a life science check to see like i'll assist with that i was thinking the same thing rick is looking at you two for any kind of indication of whether or not he should move in uh you can we're sufficiently spooked this i i don't know what this is i think this is where they were growing people creatures


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** Is it one large room, or are there two separate rooms, do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** There's two separate rooms, for sure.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:21]** Between the two, like, your room that you're stacked up on, right?

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Yeah, I don't see anything to the right.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:27]** You don't see, like, there's a wall there before you see the door, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** So Rick will move over and follow you into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:37]** I got a 28 on life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** To identify these remains.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** And I assist for 30, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** As Rick moves, he kind of just slaps Nico on the shoulder.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** I guess recall knowledge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:57]** You're trying to do that for the lumps that are in the broken glass containers in the middle, or the weird goo that is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** Life science to identify aberrations, animals, humanoids, monsters, things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** But not the things in the container, like the thing that's the goo on the walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It's not an ooze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:13]** So the thing on the wall seems like... I'm going to roll this over because I would have... Do you want me to just roll twice?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** No, I was thinking...

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** They seem like they come from, because that's a pretty high roll.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:25]** You recognize this with the information that maybe you got from the modules.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:33]** This seems like it's some sort of maybe troll flesh, but it's a goo, which is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:41]** Would I know anything about the machinery or the, what is this lab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:47]** It's where they were creating the mind-controlled trolls from the demon world or whatever they were trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** Give me... So, well, here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** That's crazy.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** Give me a... What's the description we found that we have in our notes?

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Notes, notes, notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:02]** Give me either a perception... Yeah, give me a perception check.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** And anyone else in the room who wants to give me a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** 22.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:11]** They were talking about summoning creatures, and there was an emphasis on trolls and demonic creatures.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:15]** Something happened recently that was a bit beyond their grasp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** This reminds me of Paragus from KOTOR 2.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** I haven't played that in so long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I haven't played the second one.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Yeah, I played the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** It's such a good game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Were they, like, cloning something?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** No, it's like an abandoned mining station.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** You're just wandering around.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:33]** You're like a half-naked Jedi wandering around, just kind of like...

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Where is everybody?

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Why is everybody gone?

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:40]** You just keep on finding recordings after recordings of some massive event that happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** It feels like some of the Fallout vaults.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** There's a lot of things.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** Was it Island of Dr. Monroe or something?

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** I forget the name of that book.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** There was also a movie and a game.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Dr. Zhivago?

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:05]** No, it was Dr. M. It started with an M, but he had an island of experiments and people landed on it.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:11]** It was kind of the basis for the first... Oh, John, what was that game that we played?

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** The shooter games.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Prime... Primeval?

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** No.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Resident Evil?

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** No.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** No, the, like, first-person shooter that I came over and played.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Wolfenstein?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Duke Nukem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Primal something?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** Quake 2?

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Far Cry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Far Cry.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** That's the one.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:28]** The first Far Cry was based off of the island of Dr. Monroe or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** So, with your perception check, you see some things.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** First of all, all the goo...

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:55]** on that south wall seems to run up to some sort of like a suppression like a like a fire suppression system pipe that's maybe only an inch in diameter there's no nozzle though on the pipe and as you're kind of looking at it it's probably dr okay give me a survival check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** I have high survival.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Can I join him?

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Sure.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** I'm kind of looking around.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** My survival is a plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** So are you assisting?

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** I have a 14 so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** I got a 10 with my plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** So that assists.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** That passed.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Does it pass?

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** 10, 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Nice.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** I rolled so low.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** No, no, no, because it's plus one, right?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** Plus two.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Plus two, so 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** 16.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** I can use my bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** To assist, I can use my bonus, right?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** I rolled a four plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Yeah, you got a 10, so it's plus 16.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** And I got a 10.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** Cool.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** So you made it just barely.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** All right.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** Just barely.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** You can tell that whatever made this smear went into the pipe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** That's what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Didn't come out of it.

**[00:44:39 - 00:45:02]** Further, maybe, Rick, this is where your assist comes in, is because you're looking and you're like, these broken glass containers, it seems like while there are parts of it where there's still some sort of fleshy lumps inside that you can see here, it seems like those smears came from some of these containers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Someone was breaking in, not breaking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:10]** No, I think that the case is that whatever was in these containers broke out and traveled through that pipeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** How big is that pipeline?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** An inch.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** An inch in diameter.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Big enough for a demonic troll.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** An inch in diameter, you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** Maybe it's some demonic astrozoan.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** It could be an astrozoan, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:27]** Well, astrozoans we confirmed can't go smaller than a foot-by-foot vent.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Hybrid, I don't know.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** That's creepy.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** This is going to be some monster.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Fantastic.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Here, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:38]** I don't like this.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** It's going to be a 21 in total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** 21 in total.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Okay.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:48]** You are the first person to notice this, but Dr. Okay and Rick, you also hear this too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:56]** There's this sound of a... I want to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:04]** That seems to be coming from the northernmost broken container, and there is a sound of like...

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:37]** just go back to sleep and this like putrid form seems to rise up and come up around there and it's maybe like three or four feet tall but it seems like it has this weird crazy mouth with these half-shapen arms the whole body of it seems like it is barely formed and it seems to just be like moaning and coming towards you with this elongated mouth and you all need to roll for initiatives


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:57]** all right everybody just runs out the door and on the way out i got a 14 one sec one sec let's go so this creature i don't know how tall it stands but it it looks like three or four feet a demonic version of the thing if anybody's ever seen that movie


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Yeah, I can see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Yeah, it has, like, half-formed limbs.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** It's fleshy-colored, and, like, it's gelatinous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** It's got, like, a fibrous quality, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** And a trollish face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:11]** His mouth drops really low.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Like Monk's The Scream or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** These hollowed eyes that are half-forming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** If he wasn't trying to yell and scream at me, we could be friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** I don't think we could be friends.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** All right, so, Dr.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** O.K., anybody else get around 20?

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** No.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Dr.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** O.K., 14.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Anybody, 10?

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** I got a 13.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** 13 for here's.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Rick got a 10.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Rick got a 10.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** What about you, Nico?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Nine.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Nine.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Wow.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** All righty.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Rolling rocks tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** You all heard this thing coming.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:54]** It seems the sound that you heard was probably it moving.

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:00]** It was probably closer to the corner of the room and was slowly starting to move over as you guys were starting to look around.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:04]** It seems pretty intense coming towards you.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** Rick, you look like you have something to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** I'm trying to think of my passive perception.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** I don't know where it's at on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:33]** but i also have dark vision or not dark vision what do i have yeah i do have dark vision you all saw there's no surprise range wouldn't i see it coming though like wouldn't i've been like wait a minute there's something moving in the corner no because it was moving quietly you didn't succeed you did succeed on the perception check that's why you're not in a like you're not in a point of a surprise round i don't think i rolled a perception in this room jerk


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Yeah, you did.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Didn't you?

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:36]** No, I didn't.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Oh.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Because I wasn't in the room when they first started looking.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** So anyways, it's fine.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** It's fine.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Let's do this.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Let's kill this thing.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Okay.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Unless we can talk it down because I'm not a murder bot.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** Dr. K, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Says the murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:49 - 00:49:05]** try to identify this creature absolutely go ahead it's probably demonic troll assist i think that's the proper name okay i do need the assist because i don't think that you can assist on his turn oh okay he like he's just doing that right i got an 18.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:30]** an 18 yeah you it seems to have some basis in troll you're not quite sure uh this thing is troll it is adjacent on the uh genetic spectrum but uh i don't know what to do with that information uh would i be able to like recall knowledge of troll weaknesses


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** Fire one of them?

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** I think... Give me one sec.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Depends on what kind of troll it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Depends on the troll.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:41]** I don't know about Starfinder, but another... Fire troll, ice troll, that kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** Yeah, you're not... You can't quite know from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** I mean... Son of a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Yeah, it seems like it's different enough that you're not quite sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:58]** You don't seem like you want to be reasonable as you're... I mean, he's not coming towards us, is he?

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:58]** Yes.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Is he looking violent?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** Yes.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:04]** No one wants to fight this troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Hey, troll.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** Let's be friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** See you later.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Sorry for waking you.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** We can go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** What more cookies?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** A diplomacy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Alright, so you roll a diplomacy check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:26]** I'm going to say this is getting to be your action.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** Sixteen.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:33]** Sixteen.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Doesn't seem to register anything that you're saying.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Well, shit.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:37]** Yeah.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** You got a move action.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** You want to do anything?

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Yeah, I'm going to move out of here.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** All right.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Bye-bye.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** So Dr. K runs through.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:50]** I do want to say I think you can move that far because I'm thinking running through people is like half speed.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Oh, right.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Is that what that is?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Right?

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Rules lawyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** I may not have to look it up.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** Okay.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** It's fine.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** So this is 15?

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** That was five feet.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Just moving diagonal is five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:05]** I thought you could move through your ally squares no penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Moving diagonal again is 15, so that's fine.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** And then I think that you have enough speed.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** You're like 40 feet of speed, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** 25.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Ooh.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** I think I can get here.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Yeah.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** I think you can get there too.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:20]** So Dr. K runs out of the hall.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Hey, let's just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:39]** here's what do you want to do there's nothing important in here why do we gotta fight a troll um here yeah uh here's sort of takes his cue from that he doesn't want to be this close to it so i'd like he'd like to fight out with more of space so he's gonna back out of the room as well okay dr k give me a quick wisdom check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:44]** Wisdom 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:55]** Okay, you do recall that the fleshy lumps that were still in there, the ones that didn't have this like green weird things, the bigger ones, right?

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** Those didn't seem like they were related to the trolls.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:02]** And it seemed like there was more, there was something different about those.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** It's not the same goo that was all on the walls.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:10]** So I tell you that because you just said, well, there's nothing left in this room.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Those pedestals did seem different.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:20]** And when you think about it, there did seem to be something, and maybe I forgot to tell you this, next to them.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** There seemed to be some sort of a bag next to the one that it was near.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** No, I don't want to leave.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Knowing that.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** I definitely want to come back here.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Now I want to kill the guy.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** I want to get away from this troll, though.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** We can kill him out here.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Sorry.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** I'm interrupting.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Is he going to follow you there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** I don't know.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** We could pop in and shoot him and leave and be strategic about it.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Okay.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Here's is still backing out, but here's is backing out.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:50]** But does he also know this or does I think you had done this because you also have made a check, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** I would relay this information.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Here's is going to go back after.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Okay.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Oh, I forgot.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** There's that bag of goodies that I want to steal with you.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Here's.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** I love bags of goodies.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Rick, my chain, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Oh, I was going to, I'm sorry.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** I was still reading up on the moving stuff.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** So it says you're able to move through an occupied square without difficulty.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:14]** Let's see for an ally, unless you were charging, you can move through that square of an occupied, occupied by an ally or a friendly character.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** When you do so, the creature doesn't provide any cover for you.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** So it doesn't say there's any kind of penalty for moving through there.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Great.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Cool.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Good.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** It's your turn, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** What do you want to do?

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** So you guys have all left the room, and Rick is standing there all by himself?

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** And then, yeah, I think Nico's standing right at the door special.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Can I get any cover from any of the equipment in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** Uh, because the creature itself seems to be pretty, it's small.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** I think that you would get partial cover from any of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Yeah.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Okay.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:48]** So from where he's at, Rick is going to level his weapon and take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Okay.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:54]** So standing next to one of the broken containers takes a shot.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Yeah.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** So that is artillery laser.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** I get a plus eight to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Give me a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** Oh, 16 plus 8.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** 24.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** 24, yeah.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Dang.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Yeah, so you fire this laser.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** It cuts through one of the arms, dealing damage.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Roll your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Damage roll.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Damage roll.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Damage.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** So I need a D10 plus 3 of fire damage.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Fire damage.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Fireball.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** 8 plus 3 is 11 points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:29]** 11 points of fire damage to this creature.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Pretty impressive.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Oh, that hits KSC.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Okay, that hits KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:37]** Sorry, EAC, because it's an energy weapon.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** I always forget that.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** That's an EAC?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** Okay.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** Thanks for letting me know.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:49]** So Rick is going to level his weapon, takes the shot, and then he's going to step further into the room.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Where?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:57]** Kind of just straight across from the door, and he puts one of the container things between him and the creature.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Ah, okay, okay, okay.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:05]** He's trying to split the party to kind of... Trying to pull focus and pull it away.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Okay, all right.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Nico, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:20]** So Nico Ryan is just going to, on the other side of this door, he's going to just stick his gun around the other side, cover, and he is going to do a trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:28]** If you're going to step back, not near the door, that's going to be a tough place to do a trick attack from because you're going to need to move around, right?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Like, I don't know that you can.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** That's a pretty far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** It's literally right.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Well, you should shoot first and then move, right?

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** Or is a trick attack a part of your move?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Trick attack's not part of it.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Yeah, because they can't even see you.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** So you would shoot first and then move.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** But you have, because you can pick any corner and draw a line, right?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** If it touches that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** I think you just stay where you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** Yeah.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** I'd say shoot through the door and then step away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:57]** Shooting from where you are, I think you would... I'm wondering if you would... You probably wouldn't have cover.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** I think you'd be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** All right.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** So he's going to take that shot.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:06]** And just to remind the viewers what trick attack does.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** So you can trick or startle a foe.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** That's a full action.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** You can move up to your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** That's a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:16]** You can move up to your speed whether you move... So it is part of my move action.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Okay.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:24]** Whether you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:28]** Just before making your attack, attempt to bluff, intimidate, or stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:34]** So the trick to that is you can move up to your speed, which means you cannot move at all.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** So you can shoot and stay where you are.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:41]** But if you try to move behind the wall, you can't shoot first according to trick attack.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** You move and then shoot.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** So you'd either have to move into the room or stay still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Which one do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** I'll just stand still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** You're going to stand still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** So you're going to aim around the corner.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:55]** Give me a... What do you do for the bluff?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** He closes his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:59]** He covers his eyes with his hands, but he peeks through one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:03]** He's just going to act a little stunned.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:07]** He's going to cock his head like, what on earth are you?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** And he's just going to shoot from the hip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** But what's your bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** That is the bluff.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** He's acting like he's not shooting.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Okay, got it.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** That is the bluff.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** He's acting like he's not shooting.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Hey, look over there.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** Give me a roll.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** Plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Tricky.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Tricky, tricky, tricky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** So that's a 15 on the bluff.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** 15 on the bluff.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Yeah.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:33]** It doesn't seem to notice you as you're doing it.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** It was not successful.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** It was not as successful.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** That was a really low bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** You missed your attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** No.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** You missed.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** That was just the bluff.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** That was the bluff.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** It didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** And if you missed your bluff, it didn't work?

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** The bluff didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** So you fail your attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** That's right.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Right.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** So just before making your attack, you attempt a bluff check.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** DC equal to 20 plus your target CR.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** If you succeed, you get an additional one.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Then now you roll your attack.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Now roll the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Yeah, you roll the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** That is a 10 plus, I believe, four, right?

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Plus four.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** 10 plus four against what?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:34]** eac eac with azimuth laser pistol yeah what kind of damage is that fire okay so as you go through and it hits and it hits that then it seems like uh it does hit some of the creature nicely done that's a hit roll damage roll your damage that's three damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:54]** oh wait three plus so sorry you don't add a d4 remember no i add for plus one so that's a four four damage because i have my weapon specialization okay got it so take that troll monster thing troll weird monster thing weird flesh troll kelly you're so deep in thought are you like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Kelly's very deep in thought right now.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:09]** So as that happens, Nico, you see part of the goo that you hit away forms back up as if it is like... Like you healed it.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** Like it is healing itself.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Like you did negative damage.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** Sorry.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:27]** It seems like it is healing itself from your shot, but it was also fire damage, but it seems like it is kind of going back and healing itself and regenerating itself.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** Well, Nico's just going to respond back like, well, hello, ugly.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** It is.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Let's see what it's going to do.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Will it attack Rick?

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Will it attack Niko?

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** It's going to attack me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:44]** I did roll a D100 to see who it attacked, and it does attack you.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** The weird thing is, is that it...

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:01]** turns and starts to climb up the side of the wall and then move along the wall towards you, towards that door.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Damn it.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Like it adheres to the wall?

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** Like it adheres to the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** It adds here's to the wall?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:15]** It adds here's to the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** There can be only one here's.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** Step Brothers 2008.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:21]** I'm the only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** Wait, do I get a punishment for that?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** I vote for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:25]** Here's punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** I vote against it.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** I vote for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** I vote for it because it was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** So I get it.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** You do get it.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** Let the record show that I don't agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** You don't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yeah, he doesn't enjoy it.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:42]** All right, John, you have to write a two-paragraph summary on why you don't like this.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** You've got to write your dissenting opinion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:52]** Nico, as you are shooting and then you come back around and you're like, oh, I hope that bluff worked.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** I hope that bluff worked.

**[01:00:54 - 01:01:00]** This huge, weird, putrid arm just swings around the corner.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** and just slams into you with a 26.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Oh, my God.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** Holy cow.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** No!

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** What?

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** It's always me.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Holy shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** It is always me.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** There's something I really want to do next game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** I think this is all just some kind of hallucination.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** None of this is real.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** This is me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:25]** It won't actually hurt or do anything to me.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Hello, guys.
