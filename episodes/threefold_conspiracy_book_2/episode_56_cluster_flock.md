**[00:00:01 - 00:00:20]** Previously on Willsave...

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:36]** After analyzing the remnants of goo scattered and streaked throughout the damaged corridors, our heroes courageously seek to avoid the path of destruction in favor of a control room that is curiously unmolested by the trail of carnage our heroes see set before them.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:51]** Bernice carefully enters the room to interface with the computers, but is unable to find answers as to why a Grey's body lies dead on the floor next to her, but is able to uncover schematics to what appears to be the facility our heroes find themselves trapped in.

**[00:00:51 - 00:01:11]** With the schematics in hand, our crew identifies a possible way down to the reactor level through an adjacent ladder well accessible through the control room, and with the coast seemingly clear, Rick tiptoes into the room alongside Bernice, only to be met by the screeching wails and cries of two flying creatures set to strike the soldier where he stands.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:20]** Will our adventurers be able to silence these hellish harpies, or are these angry birds about to wreck our piggies' plans for escape?

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:23]** Find out this time on WillSave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:27]** Have you ever considered that maybe you want a career outside of the norm, outside of the conventional, where you can put your skill to work?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** Then come on down to Accuton Trade College.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Where you can be who you want to be.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Get a fresh start.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Get a fresh start.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Online classes.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** That's where he just went.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Yeah, that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:48]** It's a limited selection of programs there.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:52]** It's like water mining, dirt mining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Thastron mining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Mysticism.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** Here's learned some of his mysticism from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** But not from the classes.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** He, like, just learned it while he was in the classes from other people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:09]** You know how, like, some people, like, draw, like, you know, like Kevin probably draw comics.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** Here's just drawing runes and sh**, you know.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** That's basically what he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** I did.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** I used to draw.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:20]** I got in a lot of trouble in boot camp, but yeah, like all through high school, I would draw my notebooks and stuff.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:25]** And in boot camp, they gave us like a notebook and I would sketch all sorts of stuff in there.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:32]** Like I would sketch pictures of like, you know, the RDCs or the petty officers in charge and different things.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** And one time they found it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:34]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Well, fun story.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Okay.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** Sorry.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:43]** I know I'm full of stupid stories, but so I went through the sheriff's academy, like, uh, kinda, it was a public safety internship program.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:49]** Like the sheriff's academy spread over the weekends for like high school students that are interested in going into the sheriff's.

**[00:03:49 - 00:04:00]** Well, I recently, my tech officer from that academy recently popped up on like roll 20 and I just messaged him and said, Hey, I just messaged him out of the blue and was like, you know, you popped up, I found you.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:06]** Um, I just want to let you know, like you've had a huge impact on my career and my life, even though I'm not a sheriff.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:13]** Um, he made me appreciate law enforcement a lot more than what I would have, I think, outside of that.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:19]** Um, anyways, there's a whole, whole nother slew of stuff, but I used to draw in that academy too.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I would draw all sorts of stuff and people knew that.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** And I drew a caricature of him.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** He was a very large, muscular guy with like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I don't know.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** So like Kelly.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Yeah.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Like Kelly, just like Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:36]** And so I drew him like super buff in the sheriff's uniform and I gave it to him at the end of our, our academy.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** What'd he say?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Well, I messaged him about it.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** And in this, like, it was just like a, Hey, it's nice to see you.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Like, nice to see you're doing well.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Congratulations on your promotions, blah, blah.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** And then his reply back was like, I'm glad to see you're doing well too.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** I still have that drawing.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Wow.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** I mean, that was 2004, man.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** That was like,

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** 20 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** High praise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That's a great compliment, man.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** He really is, though.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Kevin, I don't know.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** No one really gets to see it, the listener's baby, yet, but he's like an amazing artist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** I know.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** Here's is the only one I ever finished because I'm also very lazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** It's fine.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** The most skilled people are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** I've said that several times on this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:19]** Because you're so good that you know how to just... High-functioning and efficient.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Precisely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Exactly.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** You work very hard at being lazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:31]** That's also why I'm not a career artist, because I would never finish anything enough to get paid back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** Can I just clarify, did you say that he popped up on Roll20?

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Did I say Roll20?

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** You did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** No, I'm sorry.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** I've been saying Roll20.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** I was like, because we're like, I got all these other programs.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** No, I meant LinkedIn.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** That makes sense.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** I was like, there's a social component to Roll20.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** He's a gamer too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I was like, should I not mention I don't know this?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** I put it on my LinkedIn all the time.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** I probably follow Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** There is.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** Do you have all your accolades on Roll20?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:07]** But we do have, just anybody listening, we have a WillSave account on WeDo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** We do.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:12]** And I periodically get things being like, you know, 15 people checked out your view.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** It's like seven total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Four of them are right here in this virtual room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:23]** You should go on Will's profile and like vote for his CostaJet, what is it?

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** CostaJet liquidator skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** He's really good at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:57]** projectile weaponry and endorse you for efficiency i'm not sure how like legitimate that would be if we all we made like linkedin accounts for each of our characters we need to recruiters are coming by they're like wait what i mean linkedin is is turning into facebook anyway they should we could get recruited for some kind of cool like secret mission or something on linkedin that's just see that's that's what i was thinking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** Or is there a way to make GMing sound really corporate?

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:10]** I'm sure there's – we talked to Don from Hexagrid Heroes about this, about adding – there's a whole thing of leadership skills.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:17]** Twist GMing into professional corporate lettering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Speak.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** Corpo speak.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Corpo speak.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:19]** Yeah.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Awesome.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** Awesome.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** Well, speaking of skills, actually, that's not a really good transition.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** I'm going to rescind that transition.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Let's talk about your characters.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:36]** I'm just going to jump right in real quick because I just want to hear off the top of your domes.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:42]** I want to hear a favorite cherished memory from your character.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:49]** And I'm going to try and on the ones and twos, I'm going to try and get you some cool music to match your memory as you're describing.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** Oh, awesome.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I'll do my best to.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Okay.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** So who wants to go first?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Raise your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Rock, paper, scissors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** Will raised a tentative hand.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** He accepted the meeting tentatively on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** He was also the only one that was like, I have an idea for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:15]** Because usually I just come up with a topic and I surprise you guys, but beforehand we decided to collab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:20]** And then Will criticized me and Kelly for not thinking about our chemistry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** It was heavily implied, yes.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** Why would you ever do such a thing?

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** Very heavy tentacle.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** Of course, if anything was said, it was a jest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, it was something like, Will has every college course that Dr. O'Keefe has ever taken written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** Including the credits.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Professors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** What his grade was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Ready to go.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:52]** Of course, but I digress.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:55]** No, I was going to say it was just the...

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:17]** The fond days of coalescing in the scholarly environment and working towards my thesis in biomedical engineering was always fascinating and also just a time of communal enjoyment, you know?

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** Interchanging.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Ideas.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** He's true.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Intellectual.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** Campus is alive with research.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Love it.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Just love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** Squid like slugs walking around campus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:32]** Yes.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Interfacing with one another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Is that a thing?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** Like they're tentacle or whatever, tendrils?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Yes, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Just make it out the quad?

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Yeah, he's talking about research.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Interfacing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** Of course.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** That's exactly what we're doing.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** I never really thought about that.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** Bio... Bio... Bio... Rechanging of...

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:15]** medicine it's like let me study you fluids interchanged obviously how you learned all your life science of course it's just a party time at uh what college did dr k go to again

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Javon City College?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** Yes.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** No, the capital college of Javon City, so capital college.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:41]** It's the main scientific artery into the Osharu government sort of research center that coalesces at the capital of the Osharu home world.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** The leading house of education.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:46]** You must have had high marks to get into that then.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Yes.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** That's true.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Yes.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** I come from a long family of biomedical researchers.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Makes sense.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** It's almost like within us.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** Yeah.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** I could see that for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Who wants to go next after that?

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Oh, we got.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** I'll give it a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Yeah, please.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** All right.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** So I think here's his favorite memory is, um,

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:21]** when he decided to join a band of free captains, the first time he walked on a ship, it was a small sloop.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** And one of the first people that he met was Rolu.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:36]** And so this like, these cargo bay doors open up and he walks up this ramp into the ship and it's just like cold and like the air is really like,

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:54]** pungent but it's it's just an exciting journey for him and he meets rolu and rolu is just this warm pretty jovial guy or was and he just reaches out and what does he say john he says something like like nice to meet you i'm rolu but you're how does how does he do that john could you do that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:16]** yeah i want to hear it again i want to remember now john has to remember what rolo sounds like yeah i'm really on the spot here as you walk in he's like hey there i'm rolu uh is there a particular place that you're looking for no i i first uh i well i'm just here to help out in any way i can you know

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:22]** You're as starry-eyed as that there picture behind me.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** He passed you just a picture of space, not actual space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** Is that a picture of just space right there?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Stars?

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Yeah, I did it myself.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Oh, you're an artist.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** Just in my free time.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** Yeah.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:41]** You know, sometimes in between scores, you know, you're just a little down time.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** I have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Yeah, please.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** Do you draw with all four hands at one time?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:49]** You know, you get that question a lot.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** I do.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** I do.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Oh, wow.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** You're really talented.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** You're very, very flattering on the first meet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** Well, I hope I can rely on you.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** I'm new and I'm here.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** It's nice to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Good to meet you.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** I'm Rolu.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** I think I already said that, but in case I didn't, can I say it one more time?

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** I'm Rolu.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Yeah, fantastic.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Here, I'll show you this way.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Let me show you to where I do all my art.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** All right, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I'm just going to use the bathroom real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:23]** I'll be right back.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Cut to the art.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:27]** It's like painting after painting of just space.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** There's nothing else to be done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** It's like doing landscapes, you know?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Oh, my God.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** He's the Bob Ross of fucking space paintings.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** Look at this happy little star right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Look at this little black hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Coming right towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Have a nice day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Well, that was a good little interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Thanks for that trip down memory lane, John.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** That's exactly how Hears remembers it, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Oh, that's awesome.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:59]** I wasn't sure if you guys pre-planned that and were rolling out a scripted thing or if that was off the cusp.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:05]** I should have known better because we talked about this two minutes before we got there.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:29]** thanks to kelly for that improv oh no thank you john oh man i do have a question for like just pirating in general like do you just volunteer to be a pirate or like do you go through like a recruiting phase uh it's not like like it depends how did how yeah will this be will this come up later like how does one choose and become a pirate

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:48]** yeah like i do want to learn like what the origins of of here's becoming a pirate but i don't think this this was like his day of like was he already a pirate at this time or was this hey i want to be a pirate he he and here he is basically jess


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:57]** I can't imagine Hears being a cute mascot for some giant media empire like that.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** That'd be cute, though.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** False.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** We're going to have plush toys and everything.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** It'd be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Oh, man.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:07]** No, this is just Hears had just joined, but he hadn't really been on assignment yet.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:15]** It's a loose, you know, the free captains kind of make their own rules, captain by captain, group by group, and they have internal alliances, and so it depends.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** But Hears didn't go through any lengthy recruiting process.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:25]** It was just the particular group that he joined was kind of a bunch of misfits, you know, initially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** All right.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** Who paint starscapes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:36]** And then Rick turns, he's sitting in a room by himself, and he turns directly to the camera.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** My fondest memories...

**[00:15:40 - 00:16:00]** I do have to say that besides marrying my wife and the birth of my two children, the most visual memory that I have happens to be my graduation from the Abadar Corps Security Force Academy.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:13]** I remember marching in with my platoon and standing up in front of a large crowd and recognizing my wife and my family, including her parents, looking down at me.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** It was a very proudful moment.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** And I hope that I can return to those days at some point in my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** Oh, I feel forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** Yeah.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Curious.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** Curiouser and curiouser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:39]** We're slowly learning about Rick's past, like in some various outros and now.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:42]** And I am really curious, especially about his family.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** I know.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** I hope they're still okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** God, I hope so, too.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** As the player, I don't know the answer to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** This is good.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Like, each of these was like its own separate movie.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:01]** Like, Dr. Okay was like, you know, an American Pie-like style, like, you know, movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** It's a bit more scholarly than that, I'm afraid.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Well, the make-out session, you know.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** You're on to something.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Accepted.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** It's more like a food fight.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Oh, okay.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:11]** All right.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** That's fair.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** And then like, uh, I don't know.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** I guess mine is Pirates of the Caribbean, obviously.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:24]** And then the Kevin's is kind of like a, one of those, like, uh, those like reality shows, you know, where he's like, yeah, that was on our family.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Yeah.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Y'all are great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** I'm just going to say that.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** We love you too.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** I just winked for everybody watching.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:38]** Should we play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Let's do it.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:45]** What pray tell happened, though, last time?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** You know, it's funny that you should ask that.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:54]** Previously on Will Save, brought to you by John Swann.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** Brought to you by all of our sponsors that we don't have a zero of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:02]** Read off exactly what Will says in the intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** This whole tweet, we have no intro.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** And then as soon as you say that, that's the intro.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** I'm going to just leave this music on because it's good.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:26]** So both the road and the window to escape for you three seems seem to be shrinking with each passing moment.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:35]** It's good and bad as you three fight forward, escaping cruel beasts and dangerous hazards alike.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:51]** Maybe two episodes ago, you discovered this fascinatingly eerie side to the grays as you found these floating, colorful boxes where they keep trinkets and small personal goods to themselves.

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:01]** And although they appear to be from all over the packed worlds, there's no single item that you can say, oh, I know exactly where.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** Who that belonged to.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Who knows where they might be.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Or how they got there.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** So you move on.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** And although one way is blocked from a large airlock door...

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:26]** You eventually stumble back around until you find some sort of lab or containment space where several creatures were and are not now.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:32]** They appear to have escaped wrecking the door on the way out.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:43]** There was a mix of fluids from several creatures, including some that seemed to disappear mid-step.

**[00:19:44 - 00:20:13]** next to it you finally find a room with several workstations and bernice bravely goes in upon interfacing as we now know that word with the computer with the computer you find that skin to skin the interface hello computer uh one of the computers

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:35]** has schematics of the areas that you've been in, both the most recent ones as well as the ones that you were in first, and a marking that could indicate the shaft that you're looking for, the tunnel, the way down, as the stewards told you.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:54]** Now, as Rick 19 begins moving into the space to investigate, there's the intense screeching of two winged creatures that pierce the eerie silence as they all surprise you.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** And you all need to roll for initiative.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Wait, all of us?

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** Not all of us are inside.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:05]** That's true, but you all need to roll because you all heard that screech.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** Very well.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Here's rolled an eight.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** All right, let's go around.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Here's, you got an eight.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Okay.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** Initiative train is rolling.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Dr. K, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Woo.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** High roll there from Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** And what about Mr. Rick?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Mr. 19, as they call him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Mr. 19.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:35]** I rolled a nine on the dice and a four bonus for 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** So I'm going to go with four.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Okay.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Say again?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** What?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** No, I said 13.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:47]** And we're off with the surprise round for these creatures.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:54]** And I'm going to move you guys over here on roll 20 to the map.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** If you look here at the top.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:05]** So you guys are up here in the top of the map, the top center, in this long room with four computer workstations.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** And the first thing I'm going to do is roll a die.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Woo!

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:32]** As they screech and pierce the silence around you, you see these winged creatures come out that are only small size, but they look a little bit like they could be a reptile that on Earth maybe was like definitely a dinosaur that has this purple mask.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:57]** brown skin i'm gonna show you right now boom purple brown skin with these long claws that reach out and this fearsome face with these gigantic incisors and this awesome ridge on their back i don't know how to describe that what is it a bat but this is like a gargoyle it's really gross looking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** It's a good term.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Gargoyle.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Fleshy.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** It's like a gargoyle with a face that isn't... Mohawk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Yeah.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** Mohawk.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Jurassic.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Sort of... Good term.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:10]** Primal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** Articulature.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:21]** If you've ever seen the Gargoyles cartoon, it's that really skinny, small gargoyle that's kind of lame, but then it has a really scary face for some reason.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** That's basically what it is.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** It's like thorned in a way, too.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** The face looks like the dogs from Ghostbusters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Oh, I could see that.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** I like that.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Flying rat version.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** It's definitely ravenous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Definitely ravenous.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Definitely.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Definitely.

**[00:23:41 - 00:24:01]** Because as they come up, they screech out of the back of the room, and it's at that time that the lights flicker, and then the power to them is dimmed, and you are officially in dim light in this room, which I don't think would affect many of you that much, if at all.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:10]** But you can just barely make out what was their colorful, like, tan, taupe wings are now gray.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:10]** Okay.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:38]** as they especially you rick the one that is furthest away actually sorry the one that is uh yeah the one that is right in front here is going to screeching all the while is going to come over and move here in between rick and bernice and take an attack at rick wait you mean take an attack of opportunity

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:42]** You cannot take your reaction on your first round of combat, and this is also a surprise round.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** F*** it.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** Yes.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:56]** Come in to attack you, and it's gonna try and claw you as these claws come forward and this shrieking like...

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** Just comes rushing into your ear.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** That is why I rolled really well.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Not going to lie.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:06]** That's a... No, it's a 27.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Of course that hits.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:15]** The claws rip into your shoulder and continue to rip until I find a D4.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** Six points of damage cutting into your armor.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Tis but a flesh wound.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Not sure how you're looking there.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Tis but a flesh wound.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** And then the other one.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** I look irritated.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** The other one flies over here.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** Also, on your other side, to flank you.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** And it's going to attack you.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** That's not flanking.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** Pretty sure you can draw a thing through opposite corners.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** It has to be completely opposite.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Then it moves five feet further.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:50]** As it flies forward, it's completely opposite or from two opposite sides.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** So it could also be here.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I think you have to be kitty corner.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:58]** I thought it was any... No, man, we...

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** No, no, no.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Let's not get into it.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:04]** It moves five feet further and goes to attack you.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** Does an 18 hit your KAC?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** No.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** All right.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Really?

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Wow.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:14]** All right.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Look at me put in my place.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** That was the end of the surprise round from these devious little creatures.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** And I'm surprised you didn't hit me.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** I'm very surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** Kevin's literally looking it up in the book right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Yeah, Kevin's not even paying attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** He's like, hold on one second, Jonathan.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Like, looking through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Excuse me.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Fierce beasts.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** I must know.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** Can I take... Is this considered flanking?

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** I don't think you're flanking.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** Hilarious.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** What?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** That is flanking.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** That's a 20.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** Oh, no.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** That's your 21.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Why is it 20?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Do you got a plus three?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** They have a thing that helps them out.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Are you f***ing kidding me, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Is it 21 to hit?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** I shouldn't have said anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:03]** I should have let you just try to play the flanking thing and then say, like, by the way, it's broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:06]** eight more points of damage to you from this other creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** No, take your eight points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** That's not true.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** No, you take it.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** You take it.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** You're going to like it.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Sorry, eight points of damage?

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** Oh, it missed, except for the fact that I get to add on 14 points of bonus.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** I forgot to add any flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** It's literally flanking.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** You're literally looking it up in the book.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** Flanking says plus two, so where did you get plus three from?

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** Maybe do a life science check and you'll find out, Kev.

**[00:27:32 - 00:28:00]** great so it is at that moment that at the top of round one the lights come back up to full power and once again you can see in color the dangerous wounds that Rick has sustained on both of his shoulders and the creature on his left trying to think what is Bernice doing is there a chance that it's gonna attack Bernice

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** I think it would continue to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Of course, because you're just going to kill Rick.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** It's fine.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** But before we go any further, flanking does say opposite corner, opposite border.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:17]** And if you're confused, it says you draw a line from center of the two characters and it has to pass through opposite borders.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Opposite borders.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:24]** If one is on the side and one is on the corner, it'll pass through two sides, but not two opposite sides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** But it's going to attack you again, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Of course it will.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:36]** 20 20 total 20 including the plus 14 for flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** It's literally yes.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Yes.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Does that hit Casey?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:47]** I have a 20 so so yes, it does You rolled a 2 on the dice and you're still able to hit me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** No, that's seven more points of damage, dude.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:53]** This is not going well with the surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** This can't be the way Rick dies.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** This would suck.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** Clawed to death by two annoying bats.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Wow, man.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** The whole time he's like, I'm not cornered.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** I'm not flanked.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** And then they're just like, guys, I'm not flanked.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** And they're like, oh, that's it for Rick.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** That would suck.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Dr.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** O.K., maybe you hear this sound, you peek in, and you see Rick getting torn to shreds.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:28]** Yes, I'm going to head in to the facility, the lab, the computer console room, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Just the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** Stick your head into the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** He's like, nope.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:44]** I will draw myself into the room and instruct Bernice to cover us as we attempt to subdue these creatures.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** So Bernice is going to take a guarded step back on her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** And then...

**[00:29:51 - 00:30:03]** Dr. RK is going to pull out his costa jet, and he's going to first take a look and see what he can find out about them, biologically speaking.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Yes.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** Give me a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** 26.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** Wow, dang.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Don't boss it or anything.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Thirteen.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** I'm gonna die.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** See?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** Those are the rolls that you're talking about, Kip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** That's a skill check, not an attack roll.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** That's a skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Yeah.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:35]** Alright, you get... So, this is a creature called a Skreeling.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Skreeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:42]** They're these insidious horrors that lurk typically in rocky reaches of the universe.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:54]** They are the smaller version of a larger creature called a Screesire, who are monstrous lizards that are very intense.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** You do not want to get in with a Screesire.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** What's interesting is that they typically live...

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:18]** solitary lives on rocky planets or planetoids right but what's interesting is that like sometimes near settlements sometimes residents will like the screenings can be kind of annoying right

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** But they kind of take pride in having them there.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:24]** And they just tell tourists to just avoid that area.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** We have an infestation of some beasts.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:31]** So they can be annoying or they can be deadly like they are for Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** It's like the raccoons down in Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Like the raccoons in Florida.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Really?

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** I need to know about that.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Or alligators.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Yeah.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:47]** I'll tell you the two important things because I'm going to assume that you're going to want to know any outstanding things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Am I correct, Dr. Okay?

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Yes.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Yes.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Okay.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Yeah.

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:06]** So they do have an ability called Cluster, which means that when these broods of Skrillings go to flank, they get a plus one circumstance to attack rolls.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** That's how I got a plus three, Kev.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Normal, Paizo...

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Official rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Say it again.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** They get a plus one to the what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Plus three.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Plus three.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Yeah, plus three total.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** But you already get plus two to flanking when you flank.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** They get an additional plus one.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** So plus three total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** Only for flanking or are there other instances where that applies?

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Only for flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:35]** And technically now, any more damage that they do to you, you will get one point of bleed damage.

**[00:32:35 - 00:33:02]** moving forward because of this ability cluster because you applied bleed to me you didn't say that no i'm not applying it now i'm saying that the next damage that i do you will get bleed from it so watch out if they remain clustered while they are flanking right well also they have damage reduction five unless you have a cold iron weapon wait that means like they take five less damage period basically

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** from any kinetic source.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Slashing, piercing, bludgeoning.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Yes.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Unless you have a cold iron weapon.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:14]** So, either find a cold iron weapon or don't do kinetic damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:19]** Yeah, you know, in the past 52 episodes, if you can find a cold iron weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Yeah.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** If you just want to give me a flashback, that's fine.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** We can try and do it.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** All right, Dr. K, that's enough of me interrupting your turn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:37]** Knowing all of this, now I must put these beasts down.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Put them down!

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:43]** So I'm going to communicate all that I have learned.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:49]** Rick, they're going to cause some bleed damage if you don't get out of there.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:58]** And what I'm going to do is try and hit one of them with a costa jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** Costa Jet, which you've been endorsed for on LinkedIn.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** So we know you're good at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Yes.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** Took the skill test for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:13]** The higher the rank, the higher the attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** So let's see if I can hit him.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** What's your roll?

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:21]** Is a 18 enough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Is 18?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Yes.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** As the Costa Jet.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Because that deals acid, right?

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Yes.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:38]** Yeah, the acid damage moves forward and slices into, I'm going to assume, the wing of one of these Skrillings, which creature you attack in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:44]** Yeah, so I'm attacking the one that just hit Rick on the left.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** On the left.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Between him and Bernice.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** Okay, let's call that one Peter.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** Sure.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:56]** Peter is a piercing creature, and I wish to put him down.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:08]** But I'm going to hit him with both a basic inhibitor that will... I'm going to use my Spark of Ingenuity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Spark of Ingenuity.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** Two biohacks into one biohack.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Oh, shit.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:27]** And hit them with both the basic inhibitor that is going to reduce its DR by five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:32]** That's... Wait, you can reduce their damage reduction?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Yeah.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** That's freaking rad.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:39]** Wait, is it per one time or does it subsist for a while or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** For seven rounds.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Oh, that's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** That's awesome.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Damn.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:51]** And then I'm going to combine that, though, with the pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:02]** So you must... This creature must roll a fortitude save to not gain the entangled condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:06]** As a natural 20.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** And total of 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** So you're still encumbered, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Okay, so I'm encumbered.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** I have no DR. Yes.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** And that's it?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** And Bob's your uncle?

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Yep.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** Okay, I gotta check encumbered again.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** But I like it.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** How much damage did you do with that acid as it...

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:51]** cuts through the wing four points of damage four points of damage as it sears through and i'm sorry sorry four sorry uh five points five points of damage rick i feel like you can smell the flesh of this creature's wing wafting into your wafting wafting uh into your nostrils

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** And it smells gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Not tasty at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Yeah.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** But, unfortunately, it is the squealing to your right's turn.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Unless you want to do... Oh, Bernice needs to go.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Dr. O'Kane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:11]** Yeah, so Bernice is going to take a guarded step and try to hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Tried hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** Yeah.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Okay.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** To gain... Sort of just be out of sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Okay.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** To not be attacked.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** Got it.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** So make a hide check.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:26]** And I'll have to make that against a perception check if they want to follow.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Plus eight to stealth.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** 17.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** 17.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** Okay.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** So if they're going to go after...

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** You did.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Oh, you already took a guarded step.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** So you're going to try and hide where you are.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:44]** I feel like I see Bernice moving their feet back into the suitcase.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** So they just become the suitcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** No, it's more so like a bed of nanites sort of just propel it back.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:54]** Like invisibly it slinks across the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Love it.

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:01]** And then does she try and lay down to just look like a briefcase that's not moving?

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** What does she do to hide?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:10]** She looks for a printer or something, some router that's nearby.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** A router?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Some office equipment?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** If there's some office equipment and a coffee cup lying around.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Yeah, like an espresso.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** Next to some personal belongings or a bookcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Okay.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** This is good.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** I like that a lot, actually.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Good thing Nespresso is one of our sponsors.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** We just shouted them out.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Wait, Nespresso?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Nespresso, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Yeah.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Are they?

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Buy their, like, pod things.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** Those pods are great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:41]** They sent us a press kit, and I can't even remember, like, what the hell we're supposed to say.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Just buy their pod things.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:43]** Yeah.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** We get so many press kits, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Why was I left out of the loop on this?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** It's fine.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** You don't drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** It was a West Coast thing.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** I think it was at the corporate office.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Yeah.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** It went to headquarters.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** That's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** That's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Uh, is that all of Bernice's turn?

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Uh, yes.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** Okay.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** I like it.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** Bold move from Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:13]** Coming in, coming in hot, dealing damage, like nerfing their DR, which is crucial.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Smart move.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** And Bernice finding out Kev, I see you raising your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:44]** yeah who's peter uh that's the the squealing on the left what's the other one you named it peter was that in the was that one of the fun facts we got from no but it's good like a necklace around its neck says peter yeah it's a gold chain and just just to be clear peter's the one that got the inhibitor and the yeah peter's on that damage and and as the wing like sizzles he's like oh i just maxed out my 401k


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** Contributions.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Why did I do that?

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:52]** It is the Skreeling on the right's turn.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** I don't know what their name is.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Unless you want to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** Peter, Paul, and... Yeah, Peter and Paul.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** I think the other one's got to be Paul, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Yeah, definitely Paul.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:13]** I'm going to do that first before I say anything about what kind of attack I'm going to change their token in Roll20.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** So we all are on the same page.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Man...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Paul.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:21]** So Paul is a biter.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Paul's a biter, Kev.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** So Paul's going to come in.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:28]** Paul's going to just try and take a bite out of crime.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Rick's crime.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** I rolled really well.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:37]** That is a 26 against your KAC.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I don't even know why you bother asking.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Because maybe one day you'll be like, actually...

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yeah, I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** And then you were like, just kidding.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** I have a plus three bonus and it helps me beat that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:55]** It's going to be six points of piercing damage as it bites into your leg.

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:04]** Because maybe you turned and looked as Peter's wing was sizzled and it bit into your leg.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** And you also have one point of bleed damage.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Goodness gracious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** How do I apply that?

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** Do I do one bleed or do I just do a minus one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** You have the bleeding condition for one damage.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** Which I just had the conditions page open.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** It's fine now.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** Gonna look now.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Bleeding.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:27]** You take the listed amount of damage at the beginning of your turn each round until this condition ends.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:37]** Your bleeding can be stopped with a successful DC 15 medicine check as a standard action or through the application of any ability that restores hit points.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** Okay.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:46]** So I think you do take... You'll take one at the start of your next turn.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** which is now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Rick, stay in the fight.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** I got something for you bleeding.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** I appreciate that.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Thank you.

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:00]** Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out how to apply this in Hero Lab so that you actually have conditions, bleeding, and then you don't get it until next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Well, I think that's now.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** The start of your next turn, which you're next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Right.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Never mind.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** Modifications, combat states, maybe, or conditions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:14]** No, it's under conditions, but you have to put in how much bleed damage you get.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** So I put a one in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** One point, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** Yeah.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** And now I apply it.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** So, shoot, I don't remember.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** I think it worked.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:25]** I don't know if I click it every round, or how do I apply it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** Well, it's the start of your next turn, so if you need to click it to apply one damage, you would do that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** I'm afraid to click it too many times.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Don't.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** Just look at your health before.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Well, it's hard.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** I have to scroll down to get to it.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** And my memory sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Hero Lab.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** For all your character building needs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** All right.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** I think it took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Okay.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** What do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Okay.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** So I'm bleeding now.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:51]** I was trying to look up guarded step before I get any further.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Guarded step.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Guarded step.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Guarded step.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** So I want to guard.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:04]** I'm flanked between these two, so I want to do a guarded step diagonally around one of them.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:09]** So I'm out of flanking and then further away from one, but still adjacent to the other.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** If that makes sense.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** I just wanted to look up if Guarded Step protects you from one creature or all creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:21]** I feel like it would be all.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** I feel like it's all, too.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** It's a good question, though.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Period.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Okay.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Period.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** What page is that on?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Sorry.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** That's a great question that I just closed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** 247.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** 247.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Oh, man.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** That was close.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** I was like...

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:57]** pages stuck together all right yeah then i'm gonna do that so i'm gonna i'm gonna sidestep this thing uh i'm debating whether i should step like towards dr okay or away from him do you want to attack peter you want to attack paul i'm gonna well peter's the one that has the inhibitors on him correct don't distract me um i'm just asking i i can't see which way you're thinking

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** I know, but I'm trying to think whether or not Dr.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** O.K., if I step near Dr.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** O.K., if that puts him in a worse position.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Like if they're likely to get to him.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Sorry, I'm going to do it the other way.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Bam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** They're fired, so they can't flank.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Yeah.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** So I'm no longer in flanking.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Okay.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** You're no longer flanked?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** Yeah.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:23]** And I am going to... So what was the other inhibitor you put?

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** You put a minus five DC or DR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:34]** I put a minus five inhibitor on its damage resistance to whatever non-clad kinetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** A second thing?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** A cumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:41]** It's encumbered, so I don't think it can take attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:44]** I have to look it up.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:49]** Also, the max dex bonus is limited to plus two, so its AC will obviously go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Cool.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:56]** Well, then, I mean, I still had to use a garden step to get away from Paul, the other one, without getting hit.

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:03]** But, yeah, so now I'm going to... During that movement, I pull out my axe, and, of course, I roll a terrible roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Ten to hit.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** Ten to hit doesn't hit even with the additional thing.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Kev, you rolled a middling roll.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** The literal ten roll.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Yeah.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Roll better next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** All down the middle with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** That's the end of my turn.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** All right, that's the end of your turn as you swing.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:29]** And even though this creature has these weird purple veins, as you can see the toxins from Dr.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** O.K.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:36]** 's inhibitors coursing through the creature, you still manage to miss, unfortunately.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Piers, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Still out in the hall.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Here's this feeling so fresh after that rest.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** He finally has some spells back.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:51]** He just kind of clenches his fists and is like, yeah, and then like turns around the corner and like, well, actually, first years is going to do.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:56]** We we didn't figure out if there's any weaknesses like he could do another life science check to figure that out, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** Uh, yeah, I'll just tell you that there was, there was not any other, there were no other weaknesses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Rules, clarity.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Yeah.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** I just looked it up.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** Encumbered.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** You don't, you can't take AOs.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** There's no.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Okay.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** I'll double check because it might be in the AO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:15]** You do move half your speed or no, sorry.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:31]** encumbered your speed is reduced by 10 and your max dex bonus to ac is reduced by two yeah all right well here's it's gonna take a minus five penalty to strengthen dex base skill checks okay okay cool slowing down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:54]** here's it's gonna take a full action and it's gonna launch three magic missiles at peter right in his back because he's not looking at him i'm sure surprise yes and you see peter like starting to droop a little bit peter's probably gonna land on the ground because peter can't move their wings fast enough to stay afloat because of the toxins went around the corner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** Yeah, that's all right one moment plus All right.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Hold on.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:03]** I'm moving over to roll 20 Son of a bitch.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** All right, nevermind.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** I'm just gonna Everything good.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** I'm just annoyed because I wanted to make this fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:13]** All right, cool So nothing beats real dice Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:17]** Nothing beats relax you Unless you roll terribly all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** There's ten points of damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Ten points of damage to Peter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** It's got to be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** It's dead.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** It's not dead.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Shut up.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** But it does knock the creature to the ground as it was planning to do.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** It's on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Yeah.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Thanks, Dice from Kevin.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** You're welcome.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Kevin Dice.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Kevin Dice.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** All right.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** That's all here's can do.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** He just wishes everyone else good luck.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Good luck, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** Wait, you did a full attack?

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** So you hit with three dice?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Yes.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Love it.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Telepathically.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Love it.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Good luck.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** Top of round two, you all are...

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** In the middle of fierce combat, the lights flicker, but stay the same.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:13]** However, there's this shifting of the ground, and you all need to make a reflexive to avoid falling prone as this rumble erupts throughout the room.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Here's as well from outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Eighteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Eighteen from Dr. Okay.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Kev.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Rick.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Sixteen.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Sixteen.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** For Dr. For Dr. Nineteen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** Your accolades keep changing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Dr. Here's here.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:33]** Does he have to roll from outside of the room?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** Does it spread out there?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Yeah.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Okay.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Got it.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Just checking.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Yeah.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Oh, no.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** That's a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** That's a five.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** Five total?

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** You say good luck.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** This shifting happens and you fall to the ground and you're prone.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Yeah, rough stuff.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** All right.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** And Peter is okay as well.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Peter doesn't fall over prone.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** But Hears did.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:01]** I'm going to put the prone condition on Hears.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:07]** And it is the top of round two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** Does Bernice get affected?

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Does she have to make a reflex save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Yeah.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** I love that.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Like a suitcase falling prone.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Natural one.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:28]** It falls over flat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:56]** Did that suitcase just move No, I mean I I think she's fine But when she gets up she will have to reroll still you're not gonna update her her image to be a suitcase on its side instead of standing up fail kind of put the condition on

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** Bernice is also prone using the World 20 icon.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** You just draw a black square.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** It's a black square.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Top round two.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:12]** Peter is hurting, and Peter is going to attack, I feel like, Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** Because even though Rick moved, Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** was the one who did the attack.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:20]** So Peter turns around, comes over to you, Dr.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** O.K., and takes an attack of opportunity.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** And takes an attack of opportunity from Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** No, it doesn't.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** I rolled a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:34]** It moves into, to try and get further and closer to Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** So I think it will get an AOL from Dr. Okay as well.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Cause it's going to move two squares.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** It's not taking the garden step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** Okay.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** So you get an AOL as well.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** I'm going to swing at it.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Cause I had my cost jet in my hand.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Yeah.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Ready to go.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:54]** And so I had my syringe spear out, which are not my spring spirit, my syringe.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** Sorry.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Stick.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Is that a two handed weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** No, it's just one-handed.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** They're both one-handed weapons?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:05]** Yeah, it's a concealable injection syringe stick.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Can you switch without moving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Yeah, if he has one in each hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Because that's what I had in my hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Is it a versatile weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:23]** I can inject a booster or an inhibitor while using it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** Hmm.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** Well, first of all, it just means you can use it one-handed or two-handed.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** Yeah.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Using it two-handed gives you a bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** So you take your AOL.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Syringe stick.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** With the syringe stick.

**[00:51:35 - 00:52:04]** 18 yeah that's a hit because it's on the ground so it's using its wings to kind of shuffle forward that's why you missed rick but it but as it moves into the square next to dr. okay dr. k is able to just stab it with a syringe stick all right seven points of damage damn it looks pretty like it's in it on its last legs


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** I'm hitting it with the minor booster.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Which does?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Or minor inhibitor, sorry.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:16]** Take a minus one penalty to attack rolls for seven rounds.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Wow.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Cool.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** Well, it's going to attack you now.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:27]** So as it gets hit, it tries to retaliate and come and claw you, even though it has a minus one.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:32]** So 22 to hit.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** That is a hit as it claws you.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:39]** It's still able to get off a hit on you.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:49]** That is five points of damage on the base of your Osharu body as it slices open your Osharu skin.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** That hurts.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** But Bernice, avenge me.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Cover me.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Save Rick.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** It is your turn, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Well, I was going to, yeah.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** So I guess I'll attack this.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** I'll put away my cost to jet.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** I guess drop, I have to drop both of them, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** To do what?

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:12]** To pull out something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** Because question, telling Bernice to do something is a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:27]** So then you would use a move action to do whatever you're doing and that would leave you with no actions, right?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** You'd be using your standard to change weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** There's two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:37]** There's like the AI, which I can like... Yeah, limited AI means they function on their own and you give them a command or something.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Yeah.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** Which I think is a move action to give it a new command.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:48]** And then the other one is where you use your full action or something to make it move and do a standard action.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** You basically give your standard action to them.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** This is how I remember it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** I guess I can hit him with the syringe stick then.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** Again, I can go for another attack with the stick.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** I won't drop my weapons then.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** I'm just curious what weapon you were trying to pull out.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:05]** The two-handed syringe spear.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** Spear, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** But I have the stick out right now.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:15]** The spear is just 1d6 plus 6 versus 1d3 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** 1d6 plus 6.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:23]** So you try and stab again with the syringe stick.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Natural damage.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** 20.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Get out of here.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Get out of here.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Yes.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Nice.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** All righty.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Let me pull out the CADs.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Get the CADs out.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** The cards are out.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** Let me throw them up in front of the screen here.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Tell me when.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** One, two, three.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Stop.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Okay.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Card on the top.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** This is a kinetic attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** Conceal injection attack, I guess.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** I don't know.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** That's what it says.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** Special one-handed basic melee weapon.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Yeah, I guess kinetic.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Wow.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Okay.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** Ooh, perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** This is a...

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Okay.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** This is a fin filet.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:14]** The target loses one form of movement other than land movement until healed.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:21]** So I feel like it tried to move and you literally just stabbed right through its wing, pinning it to the ground.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Nice.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** That is awesome.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** It cannot fly.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** That's freaking cool.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** And it can only move 10 feet because it's encumbered.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** Oh, Peter.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:32]** Dang, how much damage you do to kill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** Okay?

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:37]** So do I do so I just roll twice or do I roll you roll twice roll twice?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** You roll twice and add the bonus both times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:54]** Okay, so I rolled a six the first time uh-huh and Five okay, so 11 points of damage this thing is so close to death you see it just struggling

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** trying to move and pull its wing out from the syringe stick, but you pinned it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Well done.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:08]** And then I tell Bernice to take out Paul.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Bernice is prone.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** So what does Bernice do?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:20]** So prone weapon or shooting while proned, right, for a ranged attack provides a bonus, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** I think so.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** Or is it the AC when you're being shot at from prone?

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** I think you have a bonus.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Is that right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Yeah.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** Well, he had concealment is what I like.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** Is that something that I could apply it or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** I don't think the concealment would apply here.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:49]** I think the prone would take any attacks against you, I think, would fall under being prone, like the bonus that you get from being prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:49 - 00:57:16]** what was your question what does prone give you it's a bonus to your ac it's a bonus to your ac from range attacks yeah that's what i thought yeah okay plus four yeah plus four well i'm just adding the condition right now prone okay if there is like an acid spit maybe i don't know but uh she's going to uh shoot from concealment or from i guess stealth but not concealment okay uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Oh, damn.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** I'm sorry, dude.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:23]** You don't have to spend an action to give it a command.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Your drone just has to be able to see or hear you.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** Okay.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** Well, whatever.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:32]** It's fine.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Damage done.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** What does Bernice do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:40]** She's going to roll that die.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** But the limited AI gives you either a move or a standard action for your drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:53]** And then the other one is as a move action, you can take direct control, and then the drone gets a move and a standard action.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** That's the difference.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** So you give up an action for them to have two actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Love it.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** 18 again.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** 18 against Paul.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Okay.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:07]** Against EAC, right?

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** ENF is what it says.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yeah, electric and fire.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** Yeah.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** That's rad.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:16]** Yeah, that definitely hits and it bypasses the DR because it's energy damage.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:29]** I feel like I can see the lights on the cavitation pistol as it... The beam forming, firing across as Bernice the suitcase fires.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** The cavitation pistol.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Dealing.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Four points of damage.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:43]** Four points of damage to Paul, who is otherwise healthy, but has a hole in their wing now.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Good job, Bernice.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Bernice, you want to do anything else?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:50]** Dr. K, is that your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** Yeah, so I guess... So can I remain invisible?

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:02]** I don't think you're invisible to attack, per se, but you're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Can I hide?

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** Yeah.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** The thing is that I don't think the hide will give you anything like concealment or cover would do.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** I don't know that it would do.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:18]** I think what it would do is probably change the effect of can they notice you and would they attack you?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:23]** I don't know if it would be like 5e where you would get a bonus or something else from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** I don't think Bernice is pulling aggro right now, so probably fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** That's my sense of hiding in combat.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Does that feel like it's right?

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** I don't know.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:41]** I mean, because in Starfinder, I haven't seen anything that's like, oh, if you hide in combat, you're going to get something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Attacking from hiding.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:49]** If you're successfully hiding from a creature, that creature is considered flat-footed for the purpose of your first attack from hiding.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:58]** If you remain invisible after your first attack, the creature is considered flat-footed against your attacks until it succeeds at a perception check to locate you or until you become visible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** I love it.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Let's do that.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:10]** So if you roll and if the creature that you're going to attack notices you and beats your roll, then they won't be flat-footed.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Because flat-footed is good because it affects AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Wait, where's the flat-footed coming from?

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** That's a skill that Bernice has?

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Attacking from hiding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Hiding.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Yeah.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:19]** Okay.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:26]** So I can imagine that you could almost hide almost every round for the most part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:31]** If I give up limited... I can do a skill check and an attack, right?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Got it.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:39]** So if I applied that... All I'm trying to get is, I guess, the flat-footed condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** On that creature from Bernice.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Yeah.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** I like it.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:43]** I love it.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:44]** Okay.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:49]** So you're going to do a stealth check right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** Yeah.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** Cool.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** What'd you get?

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** I got a 15 on the die plus 8.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** 23.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** That's really impressive.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** As far as you know, although...

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Paul was shot by Bernice.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** Paul does not know where that shot came from.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:13]** So as far as you know, the creature looks over but doesn't see Bernice.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Good move.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:18]** I like that we clarified the hiding now because this makes sense.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:21]** Now there's some mechanical bonus to hiding.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** Makes a lot of sense.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:28]** Bernice hides, firing the cavitation pistol and then retracting probably and hiding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** Yeah, there's also a condition called sniping, but I don't know if it applies here because I'm not sure the distance.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Got it.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** I'm at least 10 feet away.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:37]** Yeah, I guess I am.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Yeah.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:49]** So if you have successfully, if you've already successfully used a stealth, so I'll like if the first round and now the second round, right?

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Did I hide the first round?

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** You did hide the first round.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** So this is the second round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:03]** Yeah, but I think any time that you do something aggressive towards a creature, I think it would make sense that you would be out of stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** You'd have to go back into hiding again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Which you did.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:09]** You re-rolled and it seems like they are back and they don't notice you.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:13]** So you are successfully hidden from that creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:20]** And that's what says, if you remain invisible after your first attack, the creature is considered flat-footed against your attacks until it succeeds a perception check.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:26]** So, yeah, you'd roll your hide again and stay hiding.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:32]** That creature is only flat-footed to the hidden character.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Got it.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** To Paul and Peter.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** Wait, no, Paul would be flat-footed to Bernice.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Yes.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** And Paul is hidden.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** I'm sorry.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Bernice is hidden to Paul.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Yeah.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:44]** Okay.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** That makes sense.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Any other thoughts?

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** Considerations?

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** I like it.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** Glad that we ironed that out.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** It is Paul's turn.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** Being shot.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** Seeing Peter pinned to the ground.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Close to death.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:05]** Realizing that his best bud is going to lose him.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:22]** And not sure where that shot came from, Paul flaps their wings and just starts to nosedive across the room towards the wall as quick as they can.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** And that's our case.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Wait, towards what wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Rick wants to hit this thing.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** Hopefully in the hole and out of this room.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** To that other room where they all came.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** He's doing this.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:37]** He's cutting it right now and he's going to move it and then try to pretend like there's no attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Hey, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:41]** I'm not that rude.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** Hi, everyone.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** It's Will, a.k.a.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Dr. OK.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:54]** And I want to take a moment to thank you for listening and to thank all our non-imaginary sponsors for making this show possible.

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:02]** At the top of the show, we discussed our characters' fondest memories, and it got me thinking about my own fond memories playing tabletops.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** I have so many.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** I know that we as a show have so many.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:10]** And I know as like a community, we have so many fond memories.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** That's why we do this.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:23]** And which led me to, you know, want to ask you all out there, what are you, our listeners, favorite memories playing tabletops or maybe even your favorite memories on our show?

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:31]** Was it helping an ally in a clutch situation that left your whole party just sort of flabbergasted and in awe?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:40]** Or maybe you were role-playing some hilarious encounters with some NPCs that just had you in stitches.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:53]** Or maybe your fondest memories are facing some insurpassable challenge you were forced to face and thought you wouldn't be able to escape.

**[01:04:53 - 01:05:00]** Maybe you discovered something new about yourself that you never realized you possessed.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:02]** Let us know on our Twitter or join our Discord.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:07]** We'd love to hear your stories and memories about your table and ours.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:19]** I'd have to say my fondest memory playing tabletops involved my friends and I in my garage playing facing off a pack of wolves with a fistful of tiny ball bearings.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:22]** It's a long story that deserves a full explanation.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** Maybe one day we'll talk about it on the show.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:30]** But if you can't wait until then, again, hit us up on social media, join our Discord and join in on the group discussions.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:41]** We host with all the willing out there as we discuss all manner of things from rules to proper ball bearing use, which incidentally is Kevin's favorite topic in real life.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** That's not a joke.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Hope to hear from you soon.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Thanks for listening.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:55]** And I hope to see you next time on Will Save.
