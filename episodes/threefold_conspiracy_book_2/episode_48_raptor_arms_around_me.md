**[00:00:00 - 00:00:21]** Previously on WillSave Our adventurers step out into the hallway where three green orbs appear and in a flash prove too hot to handle, deftly delivering dromaeosaurs with dire consequences for Nico Orion, whose dismembered body now lays dead on the hallway floor.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:27]** Our remaining crews struggle to fight, flank, and fend off the fiends who first take down Dr.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:39]** O.K., and with just Hears and Rick struggling to stay alive, one dino, it appears, is dead set on dealing a swift demise to Rick, whose fate is now in the hands of GM John's dice roll.

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:43]** One dead, one down, and one to be determined.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:46]** Is this the TPK you've been waiting for?

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Happy birthday to Ken.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** I'm sure you're not listening to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** But in case you are.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** I'm drinking a delicious Nectar-Nomicon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** You guys honestly really have to try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** It's incredibly tasty.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** Blastberry edition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Blastberry.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** It sounds like it's a fusion fizz flavor.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Did you guys shake gently before opening?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Did it say to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Yeah.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** No.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** I feel like you're getting a little dull profile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Who would shake a beer?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** They got to put that front and center.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Gently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** You massaged this beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:53]** I went to a friend's house and they had vodka.

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:13]** use your words virgin mary sorry vodka virgin mary um like canned yeah and i i didn't think to because it's a can i was like it's like a can of beer but it's like as i'm drinking it it was just like straight spice and and you know bloody mary mix yeah it separates man yeah and so it says like shake well you gotta get in colloidal suspension they should put that like

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** bigger on there.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** It should be a big warning sign.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** It should say it right on top of the label.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** It's pretty big.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Don't open until you shake it.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Well, that says shake gently, which is different.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Keep cold, shake gently.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** No, this one was like shake vigorously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** Gingerly.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** It's fine.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** It doesn't actually separate that much.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** It's, I mean, even just tilting a can is like almost enough.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** You know what I think?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:41]** I think this episode is like shaking your week a little gently.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** Middle of the week, listen.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Coming in.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** That's a really good stretch right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** If your week has been hard, come here to relax.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** If your week has been nice, come here to get pepped up.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** And, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** You're listening to DJ Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** DJ Kelly on the ones and twos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** On the ones and twos.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:12]** If you're not drinking something alcoholic, please do unless you really shouldn't be.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** And responsibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That's cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** It's the ASMR thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** You're just tapping on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Leave that in.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Leave that in.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Responsibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** And responsibly.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** What should we quickly talk about?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** I have something I want to quickly talk about, but I want to open the floor to what you guys think.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** I got nothing.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Okay, great.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Go for it.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** Okay.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** I wanted to share.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** We were talking before this episode started about retail jobs.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:44]** and how they can be challenging and so rewarding.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** And I had a good rewarding experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Ad nauseum.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Ad nauseum.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Ad nauseum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** They can't be rewarding, and I'll tell you how.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** My first job, first first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** First first job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:01]** First first was as a detailer of cars at the Audi dealership.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** That's a legit, probably good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** It was fun.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It was super fun.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:10]** Do you know, close to ASMR videos, there's an entire... I love detailing a car, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Yes.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Clay bar in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:17]** There's an entire cult of followers that watch people clean cars.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** That's awesome.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** There's, like, all over YouTube.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** There's plenty.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:26]** Like, one day, one of my, like, Navy buddies was, like, just staring at his computer, and I'm like, are you trying to figure out, like, how to clean your car better?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** He's like, no, I'm just kind of relaxing to it.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** And I'm like, you're relaxing to somebody cleaning the car?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Like, that's, I just, I don't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** That's awesome.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Yeah, good for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:44]** It's one of my fondest memories, polishing my dad's car while listening to Dodgers on the radio, narrated by...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:48]** This is like just vacuuming the crap out of the corners of a super vacuum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** But when you vacuum, you've got to leave the vacuum marks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** I know, and I think it's a part of it.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** It's like a little bit OCD.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** And you got the radio going.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:01]** You got your songs or your game or whatever you're listening to or your podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** It's one of those things.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** I'm not judging.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** It's great.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** I just don't understand it for myself.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:08]** And it's the same thing with people who listen to podcasts like ours.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:12]** I don't personally listen to a whole ton of podcasts because I just can't get into it like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** But you make one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** I make one.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** And I do listen when I'm driving or when I'm doing dishes.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** But I can't do it when I'm working on anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** Well, but now, do it when you're Clay Bar in a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Yeah.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** Great.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Chilling.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** Unfortunately, you can't listen to Vin Skull anymore.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Yeah, unfortunately not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Real quick.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** You can listen to us.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** You can listen to us.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yes.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:39]** And the story that I would tell you, which is that we would like trade favors with the salesman at the Audi dealership.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:46]** So it would always be like... Favors amongst retail is a staple of any good work environment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** The work favor economy was great.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** And what would happen is that they would frequently have a customer in.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** The customer's like, I'm interested in this TT or this Q series, whatever.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** They bring it back to us real quick, peel in.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** They're like, hey, can you detail it real quick?

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** Because we're going to take them for a test drive.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** Quick five-minute detail, looking good, looking sharp.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** They take it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Next morning...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** do the once over.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:17]** Next morning, what happened is they would pull in with the cars from the special lot, right?

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** Because there's the back lot, then there's the special lot.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** They pull in with like... The rare finds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** Like the... And then they let you clean those ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Congratulations.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** No, they'd pull in with, like, the A8s.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** Right?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:35]** Or, like... We didn't do an R8, but they would pull, like, the S8 or, like, the S6, the A8.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** The, like, luxury... The RS6.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** The RS6.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:48]** And they would... There was... You know how it is in, like, kind of more areas where there's a lot of strip malls and there's a lot of service roads that get you between...

**[00:07:48 - 00:08:18]** strip malls yeah so they would say hey i'm gonna buy you breakfast you want to drive we'll take the service road so it's like a mile of just straight track and you're five in the morning at you know five six in the morning they buy you breakfast you roll through the drive-thru it was like bojangles because we're in jacksonville florida and you know get some boatberry biscuits come back great time fun good retail story and you were driving and i was driving that's kind of you were driving a right you know hundred thousand dollar car

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Rolling out to get burritos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** This is 20 years ago, so that's like a $400,000 con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** Because inflation.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Inflation's temporary.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** That's what they all say.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** I'd be curious if you guys have good or bad retail stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:36]** Or, if you're a listener and you're either working in it now or you worked in it before, let us know.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** Hop on the Discord or on Twitter or Instagram.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Let us know if you had stories.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** I worked retail.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** You did?

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, Starbucks.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** I guess that counts.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** It does count.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** I worked Starbucks after that job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** But I think you had more stories than I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Oh, I was there for a bit.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** But Starbucks was way different.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** So props to everyone that I see every day at Starbucks.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Barista's now.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** But yeah, when I worked there, it was...

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** It was like going to college, honestly.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** It was very startup.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** It had a very startup feel.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** That's cool.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:14]** I had way more close relationships that I should really explore.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** I'm not sure that means.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** With people there.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Good times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Yeah, there were some bad times.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** I had one customer that would always come in and I'm sure you know Will.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** They would be like, hey, can I get my drink, you know, like venti, right?

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:44]** And then they'd be like, you know, five sweet and low, three straight sugar, and then like two pumps of white mocha, three pumps classic, four pumps like sugar-free vanilla, five pumps this.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:49]** But then I want a splash of the chai syrup, then like, you know, half of this.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:59]** Being new to Maryland, I get picked on for that all the time because I'm like, oh, write down the 198 or I'm going to turn it on the 95.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** The 95.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Yeah, no, it's just 95.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** But in Cali, the is the way.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** Well, I only use it for interstates, though.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Oh, really?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Because you said 2.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Because I said 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** 2 is not an interstate.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** But it's not an interstate.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** It's California Road.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Highway.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** California Highway 2.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Interesting.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I think 2 is my favorite freeway.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** The 2 is my favorite freeway.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** I call it the 2.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** 210.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** You can just fly down that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** The 210.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Yeah.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** It's fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** Wait, I feel like we want... Kev?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Do you have a story to share?

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** I don't.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** I never did retail or even service.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:38]** The closest I ever got was I volunteered to do a day with my fraternity we've talked about for Sigma Beta.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** They needed people to do Six Flags.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** So we did service at Six Flags.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** That was actually a pretty rough day.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:49]** because it was like greasy floors and I was like trying to like manage.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:56]** I actually ended up managing the situation, I think, of this like little shack in the middle of nowhere of six flags for the day.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** And that's my entire experience with like service industry.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** No, I went, the only jobs I ever like,

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** The only jobs I ever held.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:11]** I worked in a warehouse for a paper company, and then I worked at a steel mill, and then I joined the Navy, and so on.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** So I've only ever worked the engineering side, it feels like, except for the paper.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** So I don't have a whole lot of service.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Wait, the paper mill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** It was a paper broker.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:25]** So they would buy and sell envelopes.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:29]** They kind of were the middleman for envelopes for a lot of banks and stuff like that.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:50]** okay a lot more exciting than it sounds i'm sure it was i just thought of the paper mill which smell bad no i worked in a steel mill well that's not really that is true yeah that's cool a lot of more forge it was forge oh that's even neater damn damn yeah it's kind of cool yeah cool yes not a whole lot of like customer interaction no mostly just forge interaction


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** So, Kelly, what about you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** I've never really worked retail, though.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** I've done customer service stuff, but it was basically teaching-ish.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** So that was it.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** What were you teaching?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** I used to teach SAT courses.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** And then after that, I was an English teacher in Japan for a while.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** That's awesome.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** That's cool.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** It was fun.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Yeah.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** But the customers were mostly pretty chill.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** I don't know.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Can't complain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** The customers of teaching are like...

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** 12-year-olds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:20]** I taught everyone from literal babies to literal people that were going to die any second.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** My actual first job was teaching kids to read.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Really?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** That's awesome.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Nice.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Cool.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Well, you know what my job is now?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** My job is to tell Kev what happened on your roll last week.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Yeah, it's all right.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** You died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Don't worry.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** You died.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:40]** Let's just say that we started last week right on the money.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:46]** You guys fighting these three dinosaur terrifying creatures.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** And we started especially with the fact that

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:57]** One of them came out of a portal between Dr. O.K.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** and Nico.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** And Nico took the brunt of that charge.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:11]** The bite, the pickup, the slash across the chest, thrown into the wall, falls to the ground, motionless.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:20]** And that kicked off a very tough fight in which you're pretty much just, I feel like you're trading blows for blows.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:25]** There's some strategy with trying to flank that you got started out with.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:39]** You're able to deal some damage, but one of the dinosaurs in a key move vanishes into a green portal of energy.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** You're fighting.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Hears throws out an Electrovor.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** Dr. O'Key unleashes some inhibitors.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** Rick is able to deal some great damage with his melee.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:57]** And it just slogs on and on until Dr. O'Key goes down.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:03]** And we're left now with Hears and Rick.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:10]** and you bring one of the dromaeosaurids close to death.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** One of them had disappeared.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** The one that had disappeared originally comes back.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:21]** And Rick, this dromaeosaurid comes to attack you.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** And it's going to be a 30 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** Are you f***ing kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** We're off to a great start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** And that's not even a critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** B****!

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Just run, Hears.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Leave us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** I mean, you can eventually revive us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Go, Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** Hears is thinking he might have to just to keep us all going.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** It's going to be six points of damage to you, Rick19.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** What are you at, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Four.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Rick19 is at four HP.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Hears, what are you at?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** I don't want to say.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** Okay.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** To you.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** You know what?

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** He starts with ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** I respect it.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** Dr. K is stable, but unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** No, I'm just tired and I can't talk, so... I understand.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** I'm stable.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:21]** I want to be in the fight, but... You're down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** I'm down.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** Rick, it is... We're into round five, I believe.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** And it is your turn now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** So, okay.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** So I still can't find it in the book.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** Is taking a serum a standard action?

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** It's a move action.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Pretty sure it's a move action.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** It's manipulating an item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Is that in the book somewhere?

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:50]** That's in the actions, which is on page two, starting on page 244.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:56]** Looking at the handy dandy blue table.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** It does say, well, it says activate an item.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** I don't think you're activating an item with a serum.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** I think you're manipulating an item.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:12]** I'm going to roll with manipulating an item because I don't think popping the top and drinking it is, you know, I don't think that's.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Out of the wrong possibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Activate an item.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:21]** Many technological magic items such as cybernetic arm don't need to be activated.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:25]** Certain items, however, do need to be activated to have an effect.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:29]** Unless otherwise noted, activating such item is a standard action.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Where would it be noted?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Serum of healing.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** I found it in the book.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** It's 1d8, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** Dude, it's just 1d8.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** I think it's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** That's my... Manipulate an item.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:47]** This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, or opening a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:51]** Yeah, that doesn't fall under activate.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** So activate items...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** You're ruling it's a... I'm sorry.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:01]** It is not a standard action to just take the healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:15]** If you were to inject yourself from... You had to dig through your items, pull it out, take off the cap, but when I gave it to you, it was all but prepped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** If you had to pull it out... So you threw an open vial to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** I gave you a syringe, bud.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Yep.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** You take it.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** It's like a field kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** I mean, I'll take it, but please, if you're listening.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Yeah, maybe not.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Who knows?

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Correct us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** No, I'm going to come down and say I think it's a move action.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** GM is ruling that it is a move action.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Paizo, reach out to me.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** Directly.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Directly.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** We should have asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Yeah, we always can ask the lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** We can always, yeah, further billable hours.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** How much HP did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** I got all eight on that roll.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Nice.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** It's a nice Starfire symbol popping up.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Yeah.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Okay, eight.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** That's an eight plus.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** After that devastating attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** So for everybody but John, cover your ears, John.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** I have 12 points of health now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Oh, wow.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** That's fine.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** One more.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** That's fine.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** I can do math.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:14]** And then I swing at... Wait, which one is like almost dead and which one is... The one that is right in front of you.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Directly to your right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** This one.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Okay, I'm going to do something real stupid.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** Wait.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** So a 14 hit.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Is that right?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** If I remember correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** I'm not going to... I mean, yeah.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:34]** This one is the one that you know already has a lot of inhibitors from Dr. OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** That's right.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:41]** Well, because I'm thinking about doing like two hits, but I only get a plus one if I split my hits.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** Here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** If you do two... You mean with a full action?

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Because you've used a move action.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** A full action would be that you would have to do nothing else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** Okay, so I'm going to swing to hit... Oh, it's dumb to hit the one that I... It doesn't matter.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** I need to kill one of them.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** So I'm going to swing to hit the one that's weaker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Why are you saying yes to that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** Because I'm still on your side.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:04]** I still want... I don't want you guys to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** But sometimes... I'm pretty sure I hit.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** I got... What'd you get?

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** 12 on the dice for a total of 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** You hit!

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** How much damage did you do?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Roll high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Do I even have to roll?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** I have plus 4.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:46]** dead how do you kill it oh it's already dead okay cool sweet so i didn't have to roll that's i love that uh so yeah rick to have like one health this whole time three health yeah rick is just furious with this thing and he just smashes it like over his head and brings it down and cuts the head off cleanly so annoying right before the blade hits it vanished no no the drum master goes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Oh, I know the answer.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** 42.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** Cuts off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:54]** After this conversation with Dr. K. Right before it hits, a green orb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Nope, nope.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** I'm not going to be that guy.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** And it is dead.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** You have a chance.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** There's one Dromiosaurid left.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** This is one of the toughest combats to date.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** And you know whose turn it is?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** That Dromiosaurid.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** And here's, I don't know if you saw, but I changed your icon for the Electrovor.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** I did.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** I did see that.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** It's pretty great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** It is nice.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Is that what Electrovor looks like?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:23]** It looks like a centipede with its antennae.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** There's no exact thing, but I feel like it's called a shocker lizard.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** It's cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:33]** It's like a little dragon, and it has a little tail that spikes out with an electrical current going between the tips.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** It's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** It's pretty nice.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** It's like a lizard with two tails.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Oh, I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:44]** I think this dromaeosaurid is still going to attack the Electrovor because the Electrovor has been doing damage, and I think that's what it's going to do.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Can it kill?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Fail.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** Fail your role.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:48]** Fail it.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** That is a 27 to hit.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** You did not fail it.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** I didn't fail, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Yeah.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** How much damage did you do, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** I do nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** All right.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:04]** Well, Electropor is going to get sucked back into his little Pokeball.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:07]** He's out for the count.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** It rocks a couple times.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Rocks a couple times.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** And then the light glows.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Yep.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Yep.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Yep.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** You've captured it.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** You can't do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** I'm sorry, Electrovor.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** I'll bring him.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I'll heal him up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:28]** And then that Electrovor, or that Dromiosaurid, is going to take a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:48]** in front of rick here's it's your turn there's one creature left it is bloodied that other one might just pop out all of a sudden that is true that other one still exists what are you gonna do here so okay um caustic conversion that's another one of the gems that we have yep okay so uh nanites to convert water vapor into tar deadly acid

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Okay, I'm just going to do, just get rid of this thing.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** So here's cast magic missile with the glove.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Oh, dang.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Okay, full action.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** That's not a for sure hit, so yeah, full action.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Yeah, that's a full, that's definite hit.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Did you move?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Huh?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** Did you move?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** I don't think you moved.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Does it matter?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Oh, it does matter.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** Because if it's a full action, you can't move first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** So you're still... Here's has been back behind the double doors this whole time.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** You can still see.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Yeah.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Yeah, I can still see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:17]** Plus I have blind sense and stuff, so... Yep.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Okay.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** Oh, crap.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** One, three, and four plus three.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** So one, three, four, seven, eight.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Eleven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Eleven points of damage.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Nice.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** This Dromiosaurid looks hurt.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Bad.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Bad.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Here's Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** It is your turn.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** Are you going to stay in the fight to do stay in the fight?

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** What's the mechanic for that?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:50]** You got to spend another resolve point, but you get one HP, one HP and you're up.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** You'll start prone.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** You spend part of your movement to get up.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:54]** Okay.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Yeah, I'll do it.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** And that's my whole.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Well, no, you have standard action.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** You could attack from prone or you could stand up and then attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** No, I'm going to do none of those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You're not even going to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** Okay.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:16]** I'm going to aid my friend Rick.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** I think I... Yes.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** And I'm going to do first aid, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** On yourself or Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** On Rick, but maybe I can't.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** I think you...

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:36]** Basic med kit, spray, antiseptic.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** Med kit treats it like a condition versus healing.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** I could just apply another healing serum to him.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** You could?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:55]** Or I could spend a biohack and improve his armor class or give him...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** What's it going to be?

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** What's it going to be, Dr. Okay?

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** I'm going to give myself a healing serum.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** Okay.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** That's it.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Okay.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Give yourself a D8, right?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yeah.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** All right.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Healing yourself.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Good move.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Safe move.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Make sure nothing happens.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Five.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Okay.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** So you get five.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** Eight feedback.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** You're at, what, six now?

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Yeah.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:15]** All right.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** You want to do anything else now?

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I think that's all I can do.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** What do you say as you come up, as you wake up?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:25]** What just... What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:47]** oh goodness i can picture you like yeah like your tentacles fumbling for the healing serum and you grab it welcome back doctor okay but this fight is not over here's guys well there's one less of them that's great yeah it's dead pretty much at your feet i like your just recovering voice it's good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** From the rules paralegals, Jeff and Jeremy said standard.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Jeff said standard for yourself, full if it's on someone else.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** For if it's a mover, standard action.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** So standard.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** That's what Jeff said.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** That's what Jeff and Jeremy said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** See, I told you because it's not stated otherwise.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** That is definitely like rules thing.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** All right.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** So that thing's back alive and I shouldn't have been able to attack is the point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Oh, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:14]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Why?

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** Because I only get one standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** So my standard action was to heal myself instead of attacking.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** And that leaves you open to be attacked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Yeah, I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** Full if it's on someone else, such as unconscious PC.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Full, meaning you don't even get to move.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:29]** Okay.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Yeah.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** All right.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:31]** You know what?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Thank you, Rose Lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Thank you, the firm.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** Are we just moving forward with the death instead?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** We'll correct ourselves from moving forward?

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Or do you want to retro...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** I feel like I ruled it as a move action.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** I'm going to stick with that ruling and all the consequences that will come with it, whatever.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** For the time being.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** For the time being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** In this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** Because we didn't know.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** But there's one left.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** And things could still go south.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yep, they definitely can.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Things could still go south.

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** Dr.

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** O.K.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** 's up.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Rick's up a little bit.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:05]** But one crit from the one dromaeosaur left and things might not be well.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** And it is the top of round six.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Rick, it is your turn.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** Take a serum of healing and waste my entire turn.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** I was a joke.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** Wait, so the re-rule is that you didn't take it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** No, we're going to move.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** You ruled it as a move.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** Yeah, as you took the move.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** From now on.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Yeah, it's a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** You know now.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Have to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** I was correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Yes, you were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** I conceded.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:37]** But yeah, so I don't have another serum of healing, so I'm not going to do that.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** Yeah, I'm going to try and attack this other one.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:47]** Actually, I'm going to take a guarded step because right now there's like a line of sight with Dr. Okay that I'm blocking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** You're blocking Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:56]** And here's technically, so if either one of them wants to assist me, so I'm going to do like a guarded step diagonally next, like just kind of cycling around this thing.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Shuffling over.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** I like it.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** I like it.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Okay.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** Roll to hit.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Roll high if you want to end this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Natural 20.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** 19.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Dang.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** So I hit.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** You hit.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** And that's going to be 12 points of damage plus 4.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Nice.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You mean a d12 plus 4.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Yeah, 12 points.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** No, it's only 4 points of damage.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** So 8 total.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** I did mean a D8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** HP left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Yes.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Yes.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** All right.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Nice.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** And it falls to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** And then three more green orbs appear around us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** Just like a head pops out like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** What are these orb things doing?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Exactly.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** Just transporting creatures into our area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:51]** Right as Rick slices down the one, this green orb appears next to him, and the head pops out and stares at him.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** And he goes, clever girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Heads up, guys.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** That other one could come back any time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** You wait for a moment.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** I am quite aware of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** And it doesn't.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** All is quiet as Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** lays breathing on the ground.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Nico lays motionless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:19]** I'm not trying to seem insensitive, but I'm going to raid Nico's body for that armor because I think his armor is way better than mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Do we need any of these items?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** No.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Are there things that he collected?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Do you all say anything?

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** I don't know.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** I don't know how much he had.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** Where is he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:41]** In game, Rick walks over and lays out Nico's body and crosses his one remaining arm, chest, and closes his eyes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** His right hand is missing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Oh, just his right hand.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** So he crosses his arms across his chest then and kind of just ceremoniously sets him down.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** Kind of does like a, not quite a last rites, but, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** We have a moment.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Here's Niels, takes off his hat.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:05]** And holds it to his chest and just looks at Niko and touches his face and is like, Your heart's gone home, buddy.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** And then he checks Niko's person.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** Like a true pirate.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Niko would be proud.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** I know you'd understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:23]** Dr. Roke stands pensively by his fallen comrade and says,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:48]** chance to yari's uh lady of wisdom uh guide him here's his angry this is not cool what happened and so he's just more incensed about whoever is doing this to us our companion's dead oh goodness he is your companion that boarded the chimera with you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:58]** He investigated the craziness that was the chimera, all the activities, all the confusion, all the enemies.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** He survived nearly, he almost died.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:10]** And you all almost had situations of close to death, surviving the exploding chimera.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** You all travel on these four escape pods.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** You come through and explore these labs.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:21]** You find out that there are greys that are behind something with the Chimera Project.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** You face death many times over.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:30]** And Nico finally succumbs to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:34]** Rick's not going to make it very apparent, so I guess I should roll a sleight of hand, maybe.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** But he's going to kind of reach down and touch behind Nico's neck.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:48]** He's verifying whether or not... We've seen all these other players, not players, NPCs fall.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:56]** And we finally realize with the bolita that there's actually a bomb planting in their necks that is the same...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:10]** Well, so here's the thing if you want to do an autopsy that's fine, but a couple other things happen god Oh, that's that teen green orbs appear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** GG, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** We're just going to stop recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** It was a great episode.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Thank you for listening.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Good episode, everybody.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** We are 40 minutes.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:31]** So the hallway seems to just be quiet.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** The lights are flickering.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:38]** There are dead dromaeosaurid bodies in the hallway.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Maybe it's a few minutes after you stop.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:49]** But there is a... And the green light appears from inside the dromaeosaurus bodies.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** And they... Pulled into the portal.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Portal.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** Portal.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** The green energy.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** They are... They vanish.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Their bodies vanish.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** The dinosaur's dead bodies vanished?

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** The bodies vanish.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** WTF, mates?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** I need one thing to happen.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:10]** And that's... Here's... You need to roll a perception check.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:17]** And I also need Dr. O'Keefe, your... Microlab?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Your Microlab, thank you.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:25]** Starts to ping as if you were running a test from when you did an autopsy on the Belita.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** And the results are in.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Do you remember that?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Vaguely.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** Okay.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** You looked to see... Sounds like me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Sounds like Dr. O'Keefe.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** Oh, did I run this cron job like five hours ago?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** There was... I feel like you did it on each other.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** Remember?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:55]** You did an autopsy on the Belita, but you did it... You ran everyone's bio data to see if they have a bomb in the back of their neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** Oh, that's why there would be a spike.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** I look at my pad.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** It comes back negative.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:07]** There's no bomb from the data that you can tell in your neck.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:10]** And maybe when you do the autopsy...

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** I'm going to have you go ahead and roll, Dr. O'K.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** I want you to roll a one second.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:21]** That would be, what, probably a medicine check to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Medicine, life science, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Yeah, I would say medicine.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** And while you're rolling that.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Go ahead.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** I'm going to roll to assist.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Okay, roll to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Sorry, what skill is it?

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** 14 perception.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Oh, it was just a 7.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Wait, why are you rolling perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** I'm not sure.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Did you aid in medicine?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** I aided, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Here's is pretty torn up, so he's not too perceptive right now.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Not too perceptive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** 28.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** You needed a DC 25.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:54]** As you pull in Iko's data,

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** His blood comes through into your micro lab.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** You start cutting away at the back of his neck.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** You start seeing everything that's going on.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:11]** You confirm that there's no cortex implant that's a bomb in the back of his head.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** Just like what your micro lab already confirmed for all of you already.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:32]** You're looking at it, it seems like he died from massive wounds, both being in the neck, head, and shoulder, and also rips across the chest and massive blood loss.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** Something just seems odd, though.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:40]** As you go through and look at the buildup and all of his vitals...

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:55]** He seems like his body is naturally nutrient-rich, which seems odd because you all haven't had the best self-care, right, in the past few days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** What?

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** We had our own culinary developer thing.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** That's true.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** But I'm just saying in terms of, like, stress, life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** We got some good food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** It just seems like there's a, he just, like the basic building blocks are just, he's very nutrient rich.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** Here's, you rolled a seven.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:19]** Some part of you is mourning Nico.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:25]** But in the back of your mind, you begin to hear sound.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** You're not sure what it is.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:33]** And you realize there's something in your telepathic senses that's pinging.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** It feels like a rhythm.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:46]** And it starts to come through more clearly as you begin to focus on it, even with a seven.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** And you can hear it in the back of your head.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** And you feel like the pinging is coming from somewhere nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** Probably that great communication device or that telepathic sort of technology they have, maybe.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** He tells this to the group.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** Can you hear this?

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Because I can.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** I hear this ping sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Bong, bong.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** I got a 12.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** You don't hear it, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** I do not pick up anything, no.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** It might just be me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** 18 perception.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** 18?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:33]** Maybe just for a split second, Dr. K, you're like... It's like when somebody says, hey, do you hear that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** You're like, yeah.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** I think I do.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** I think this might only be a Navy thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:43]** Do you guys ever have to do the hearing tests where you're wearing the headphones and push the button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Yeah.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** I had to do it for speech therapy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** Oh, we had to do it annually for the Navy.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** And the joke was always like, everybody in the military has some kind of hearing loss.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:59]** And so whether or not you hear the beep or not and just push the button anyways... What they don't tell you at the recruiting office?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** Yeah.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** You will eventually... You might...

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** Just get some hearing protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:14]** Don't be... Well, then there's the whole Facebook lawsuit about even if you had the hearing protection, it wasn't good enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yeah, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:24]** But yeah, the whole joke is whether or not you put... It was like a full argument of whether or not you push the beep for everything you hear or if you don't push the beep because you already hear it.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** Because you have tinnitus.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** I was definitely in that game of like, oh, man, am I hearing that already?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** I definitely hear the pinging.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** It's just ringing in my ear.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** I definitely hear the pinging, though.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** That's not on my tinnitus spectrum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:48]** So what do you do in this dark hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** We take a long rest.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:56]** I mean, no, I'm actually going to take 10 minutes and spend an RP and get my stamina back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Yeah.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Yeah, I can do that.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:03]** As you guys sit down to take a long rest, the minute... Are we taking a long rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Sorry, a short rest, right?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Let's decide.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Hold on, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** Well, let me tell you something.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** You're looking at Nico.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Maybe it's the stress.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:20]** Maybe it's just the fact that everything that you... Your party dynamic has changed.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** You are three people.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** You've lost somebody who's been there from the beginning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** And that last fight was definitely unbalanced towards three people.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** I'm just really bitter about how hard that battle was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Hey, man.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Sometimes things are tough.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:41]** As you sit down, you feel this familiar, this sense of thinking back.

**[00:39:42 - 00:40:11]** to the dromaeosaurids and then small insect that you're fighting the little doll and then to the bounder how tough that was and then to the gray and the data foundry how it wanted to use your brain and then to the the ooze and then to the bolita and then to the security robots and the tension you're running back through everything in your mind and as you sit down you feel time slow for a brief second

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** And then when everything speeds back up.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:44]** your level four yes i knew it oh wait does that mean our spell cash resets or no i don't think so typically what it means is that your spell cash doesn't reset but you gain the the i think what we've done before is that you gain the hit points or stamina points that you would gain for the level you don't replenish what you've lost so for your level you would gain a certain amount right we still need to do a full rest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** But you know what this means, though?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** Is the bad guys just get that much stronger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Yeah.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Is that a thing where they scale with the party level?

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** They do scale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** I didn't know that.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** There's a way to balance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** They're dinosaurs.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** They have scales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** They're all union scale, right?

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** It's fine.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** They're all union monsters, alright?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** We're running a game above board.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** So we pay them fairly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:10]** Yeah, so they have benefits.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** For the ones that we killed, their family gets something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:39]** yeah it's not like squid games no you don't pause there it's not like squid game a million dollar a million oh i guess you get like a million like life yeah no what it wasn't what is it in korea i forget korea is it one what's that yeah it's one it's one in korea it's one i think yeah why why do you say that though well because like a million won oh yeah it's only like it's basically like ten thousand dollars or something yeah it's less than zero zero zero eight five not a lot of money state dollars


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:42]** Yeah, I think that, like, $400,000... And you are correct.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** $400,000 is, like, $40 million or something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:54]** I mean... Well, there's, like, a terrible joke about Squid Games and how, like, the $48 billion won was actually just, like, $66,000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** No, no, no, no, it's not.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** It's, like, some million.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Yeah.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** It's a million, but damn.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Yeah.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** To risk it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:07]** Either way, whatever money the family gets, it is a capital gain, and so they get taxed on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** Yeah.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Well...

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:16]** I mean, if we want to get into the tax structure of the dromaeosaurid planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** I'm actually thinking about Nico.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** Nico's mother that he hated so much probably has his life insurance policy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** Oh, that sucks.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** That's messed up.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** You'll find out more if we keep playing.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** We are talking about the level up.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** Level four for our characters.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Let me grab that level up music.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** Where are you at?

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Level up music.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Are we going to describe what we did?

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Well, if you want to.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** There's no obligation.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:52]** It just makes it cooler for all the listeners and me to live vicariously through your characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** I want to be very transparent, especially to the firm.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Be transparent.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** I'm using Hero Lab, and I am a soldier.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** I have four levels in soldier now.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:07]** And from my count, according to the rule books, I should get a combat feat on first and every odd.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:13]** And then for soldier, it says I get it on second and every two.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Yeah, so pretty much every level.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:23]** So just math-wise, I should have four combat feats, but for whatever reason, Hero Lab... Hero Forge is also a great website.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** Go build your characters in 3D and print them out and everything else.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:33]** No, but on Hero Lab, which is a great website, and I really appreciate it, but I don't know if it's a glitch or if I'm screwing something up.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** I'm only getting three combat feats.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:40]** So I'm going to trust Hero Lab over my own... Really?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** The corner book says you get everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** I might just be reading it wrong, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** No, I don't think you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Well, here's another thing.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:53]** I don't want to add it and then have it have that red flag constantly because that bothers me more than not having the feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:58]** You would literally hamstring your character to not have the pending notification.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I don't want any error marks.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** It's a mark on your soul.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:07]** You ever look at somebody's phone and they have 1,300 emails?

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Yeah, or 13,000.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** I would break my phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:13]** Some people struggle to get to zero, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Dude, inbox zero is a real goal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Yeah, that's a real problem for a lot of people.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** I'm actually at inbox 99 right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** Maybe for you computer types.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:26]** Because you are a computer type.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** I know my wife's inbox gets pretty big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Kevin, you got to know.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** It's been said a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Matt, props to you.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** I'll wait.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:42]** Frankly, you're dealing with more people's bullshit than most of us have patience or time for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Well, Carissa.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Thank you, Carissa.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Thank you, Carissa.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Ariel.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Ariel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Ariel and Ariel.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:52]** Actually, all of our UCLA law friends and fam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Absolutely.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** That's all we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Not USC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Hey, watch it.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** I don't know any USC lawyers.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Do I?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** No.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** I do.

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** Justin.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Anyway, I was just saying like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** All right, I'll stop, brother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** The reason why like.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** Danielle, David's wife is, I'm pretty sure, USC.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Fight on.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** Who wants to go first?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Kelly.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Kelly's been raising his hand for 20 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:19]** All I was just saying, it was just to dig at Kevin because Kevin's like, I never get any email, but it's because he uses a hotmail, which we might have mentioned on the podcast before.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:27]** So probably the only email he has is from businesses that don't exist anymore or like AIM or like whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:33]** He was really good at Yahoo Instant Messenger updates because it wasn't AIM or ICQ.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:37]** In fact, I had a band called ICQ, and I didn't realize it was like some... Messenger.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Yeah, it was Messenger.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** We were called the Irving Clements Quartet.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Shout out to Andrew Hanson and Felix Chang.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** And we were only three people, and we called ourselves the Irving Clements Quartet.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** One time somebody said, oh, where's your fourth member?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** You're a quartet.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** And I said, oh, Irving?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** Irving Clements?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** He has scurvy.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** And that was canon.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** And every time somebody asked where your fourth member was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** And we played for like three or four years.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You're like a group of pirates?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** Every time they asked, I said, oh, Irving's sick.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** He has scurvy.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Everybody eats your oranges.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Scurvy.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:18]** Vitamin C. Anyway, who wants to go first in the... Wait, I just want to clarify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** My work emails also are very... Once they come in, I clear them and that's it.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** You're at inbox zero.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** That's great.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** It's a meditative state.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** It's like Nirvana.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Who wants to go first?

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** I'll go first because I just talked about I'm a soldier level four.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** I should have a combat feat.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:34]** I definitely got some more skill abilities stuff or skills.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** Sorry, because abilities are separate.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:40]** I got extra skills and I did just use an RP point and got my stamina up.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:47]** That last fight was really bad, but I'm looking pretty healthy now because I get all the extra health from my level up.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** And so I'm now at 19 health and full stamina.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** So I'm solid to go into another fight and almost die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Yep.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** You were at 4 HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** I was at 4 HP, and now I'm at 1932.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:07]** And to be fair, even though you had the healing serum, because I keep thinking we got that rule wrong about the healing serum, maybe that monster wouldn't have died.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** It was at 3 hit points.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** I feel like it would have died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** Yeah, but it could have hit me first, and then I would have died, and then I wouldn't be able to hit back.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Maybe.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** It changes everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** But what if you hadn't hit the other one and you rolled well, you rolled a 19.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** What if you hadn't rolled and then it hit you again?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** So it's like you still had one that had a good hit point.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** So, you know, who knows?

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** All right.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** So do you want to share anything cool about your class or no?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** That was it.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** That's all I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** That's it.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** All right.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** I'm probably screwing something up, but I didn't get anything besides.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** I don't think you are.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** I don't know.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Have faith.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** I trust you here a lot.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** I want to hear what Dr. Okay.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Oh.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Oh.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** So we paused and like stopped recording in order to build our characters.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** Yeah.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Dr. Okay is over here like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Yeah.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** I've been planning this for a long time, gentlemen.

**[00:47:52 - 00:48:04]** And he reaches into the belongings of his beloved colleague, Dr. Ion Boushdakis, to his briefcase.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:05]** Oh.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:17]** It's like something about this combat and what's been going on, something seems maybe not awakened in him, but Starfinder story time, fun fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:34]** The Osharu homeworld of Javon is a planet that is tamed by the Osharu race through the force and will of drones and

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:45]** automated robotic items that they've built to sort of tame the wilderness and the beasts that exist outside the crystal walled cities.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:51]** And so actually walls of crystal, uh, crystalline structure.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Uh, so it's some sort of field like wizard of Oz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Why not?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** Emerald city.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Favorite material scientists.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Yes.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** And much more.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:08]** So they have both a command of the sciences as well as machinery.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:13]** And as Dr. Dr. Okay.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** Reaches into Dr. Briefcase.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:28]** He reveals this drone that he can now is like finally in reset mode and he can now reprogram for his own means.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** I love it.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** That's awesome.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** That's really cool.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** As he takes the mechanic class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** What does the drone look like?

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** The mechanic class.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** Little multi... Multiclass.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Multiclass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** Wait, is this the first multiclass you've taken?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** Yes.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** You've been biohacker, biohacker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:47]** I've been biohacker three for a long time.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Cool.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** You were a biohacker OG.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Multiclass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Multiclassing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** I feel like we need a multi-class.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** And I feel like that could be a jazz song or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:11]** This particular drone, I imagine, is a new construction, new experimental construction from the tech revolution.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** It's an R&D project.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** And it was foretold, or at least it was told to Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:27]** when it was procured, but I believe it was Orion Industries that helped develop some of this material.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** And it's a sage drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** It smells really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:36]** I think it's like, it's the tiniest drone that exists.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** And it is, it's very concealable.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** It's, I'm trying to pull them up now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:48]** Just want to let the listeners know I am fastidiously writing notes as he is.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** I'm like, let me just plan some things here.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** It's good.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** It's good.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** I like surprises.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** I like the vocabulary we use on Will Save.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** Thank you for your indefatigability, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** What word was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Indefatigability.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** It sounds like a bad word, but it isn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** No, I want a definition.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** It means... Use it in a sentence.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:21]** Well, you just did, so... The British army, when it pushed into France in World War II, pushed through wave after wave of Nazis and showed their indefatigability.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:26]** It is tireless determination.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Tireless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** Amazing.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Thank you for that.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** I'm sorry.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** I interrupted something.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Perfect.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:40]** I have a very limited vocabulary.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** My brain does not remember big words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** You're just underwater for years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** It was long before that.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I blame Diet Coke, actually.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** I drink a lot of Diet Coke.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** I love when big words come out and I'm just like, what does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:00]** All right, so Will, tell us about this tiny drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** Yeah, so he's a sage.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** She's a sage drone.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** I'm going to call her she.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:14]** A joint project between the Oshara Homeworld University System Research Project and Orion Industries.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Scrubble, scrubble, scrubble.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:36]** It was a drone developed in secret to deliver medicine as well as like... So I can... This particular drone has a tool arm that I imagine can now inject and utilize my custom micro lab augmentation.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Nice.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:42]** In order to both analyze as well as...

**[00:52:42 - 00:53:02]** utilize you know minor inhibitors and such force can can mix on the fly so to speak the concoctions that i develop over time uh through fastidious study of uh of biomechanical engineering and pharmacological genetics


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** So would you say that your drone is a mixologist?

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Okay.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:26]** And being a joint venture and now seeing my dead colleague also here in this room, I remember and I recall Nico's name and I think long and hard about the origin of such Nico.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** It's from an ancient language.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:35]** for, for like Nike, like Greek victory.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Yeah.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Nicholas is based on Nick.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** Nick is Greek name.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:43]** uh, yeah.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:47]** Anyhow, uh, Bernice in aid of victory.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:58]** I dub the, uh, my drone Bernice in honor of Orion industries and the, the history from, uh,

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:05]** Much research and development in private with Boushtakis and Orion Industries and the side project.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Secret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Yeah.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:14]** If that doesn't make you want to keep listening to Will Save, then I don't know what will.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Because this is just f***ing cool.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** This is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Hi, guys.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** I'm a soldier.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:25]** I built this drone thing from scratch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** No, no, no.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You reached in and pulled out.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** So what does Bernice look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:35]** Bernice is like a... Is it like a snitch from Harry Potter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:39]** Yeah, but she has an amorphous quality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:46]** It's actually like experimenting with interdimensional shifting, I would say.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** Because it's like a cloud almost.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** It is almost vapor.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** Is it like a cloud of nanites or something?

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Yeah.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Whoa.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** That's pretty legit.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** That's super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** They shift reality around it to travel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:05]** I picture it's like the fairy from Legend of Zelda or like A Carnage of Time.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Listen.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** It just floats around your head.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** It's like a feather on the wind.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** Whenever you talk to somebody, it goes and floats over their head and like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Let it be that.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Annoying.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** We broke it down.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** John, you okay on this?

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Give us wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:23]** Sorry, Kelly's saying listen.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Listen.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Anyway, all right.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Wow.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** This is just the coolest thing to watch.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** This is so cool.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** This is good.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** All right.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Kelly.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** Kelly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Oh, this was a hard one.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:39]** I had a lot of options, but I ended up going with, um, Kelly was very focused on his laptop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:45]** It was, it was hard, but, but I'm doing mirror image.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Ooh.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** So we've encountered mirror image before.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Good choice.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** In the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** We went on our side now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** Yeah.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Yes.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** I remember being a major pain in the ass when we were fighting that.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** So I hope we can be a pain in the ass.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** Can you cast it on other people or is it only on yourself?

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** I think it's only on yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Let's look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** I'm not saying that's ineffective.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** They're only on me.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Okay.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** But that could help target, that could help other people.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** Hopefully he can draw fire and become a distressor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:20]** This is a super meta game, but Rick seems to always be the one in the middle of the fight.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:24]** So if you could do it on him, where Hears is always on the outskirts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Yeah, no, that's the thing.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** So, like, agreed.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** Because Hears doesn't want to be up close.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Tactical.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Yeah.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:37]** Also, sometimes, like, you notice that I'm out of rooms and everyone else is in a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Not as much as, like, when Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** walks into the kitchen.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** One time.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** We haven't forgotten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** I haven't forgotten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** I, uh...

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** But it was a good... I'm an android.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** I remember everything.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Except for Kevin can't remember anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** Yeah, that's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** But no, well, I'm sure you'll put the mirror image to great use.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** It's hard.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** That's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** I almost... This is total metagame and whatever.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:07]** I almost didn't even want to mention it in the intro because I was like, should I choose that?

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** Should I choose inject nanobots?

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** It's really good too.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** But there you go.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** But as a not close range fighter, it doesn't make sense to do the other one, I think.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** So let's take a minute.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:31]** You all have sat down in the midst of probably what is a very jarring fight, which your compatriot and colleague, Nico Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Oh, wait.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Sorry.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Yes.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** Nico's dead, and I wanted to steal his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** What did we find on Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** What was his armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** question.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Defrex hide, wasn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I think it was a defrex hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Who wants a defrex hide?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Defrex.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:49]** Defrex hide armor was also found with the storm armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** It only showed up once.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Or was it a different one?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** I'm pretty sure it was defrex hide.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** He also had jump jets.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:04]** Suffice it to say that in these trying times, I think Nico would most understand that you need to take what you need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Like, yeah.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** I think you would


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** Hashtag liabilities.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** Hashtag liabilities.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** So it's a tough moment.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** And you're sitting in this hallway.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** There is a pinging.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** And here's his head.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** And you're in a dark hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** What do you guys do?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** I mean, Rick doesn't hear the pinging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** He just told everyone about the pinging.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** You know you kind of heard it.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Well, Will kind of heard it.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Well, Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** kind of heard it.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** And Kevin knows it's there, but that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Yeah, Finley remembered that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:40 - 00:59:08]** i'm going to say bernice say uh do you mind let's let's go for a spin and uh she's gonna go up the hallway and perceive ahead you sent chad up right i think yeah chad's up there but can chad do a perception check uh no dr okay i'm putting this cloud find out for right now that is bernice b-e-r-n-i-c-e


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Yeah, bring these.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** All right, so let me ask Chad real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:15]** I programmed here with Aklo and Common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** Okay.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** So Bernice is there.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** So as you put Bernice up the hallway, there's a couple of things.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** As a reminder, the hallway is about 60 feet long.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:31]** There are two sets of double doors at the end of the hallway, probably into two separate rooms on the left side.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:39]** On the right side, right ahead of where you were in this close quarters combat with these giant dinosaurs...

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:45]** There is one hallway that as you go down or as you look down it, again, the lights are flickering.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:50]** It seems to extend for maybe 30, maybe 40 feet.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** And at the end, the hallway splits.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:57]** You can see some sort of rooms at the end.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** You can't really be quite sure.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** There's some multicolored huge lights.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** That's down the first hallway on the right.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:08]** Down the second hallway on the right, you see not one but two doors.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** One of the doors is intact.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** The other door appears to be bent and broken.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:23]** Hears, you feel like the sound of that ping is coming from one of the two doors on the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** What did Gashir... Hears tells that to the group.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:32]** I feel like it's coming from those left side doors up the hall.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** That pinging, by the way.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:40]** And remember, that's how the Greys talk and make things happen is through that telepathic pinging, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** One more thing.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Right.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** The first hallway to the right...

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** There's a door, a single door, single leaf door.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** I'm not going to reveal it yet.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]** Well, cause you're kind of seeing it through the, can you see through?

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Okay.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** So is that happening telepathically?

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Is that through an implant?

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** How does that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** There is a camera attachment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** Actually, I didn't have the camera attachment.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Nevermind.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Okay.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** So, so I'm communicating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** And it's giving me some sort of feedback from sensors.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Yeah.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Got it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** So there is a couple things.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** You got the first hallway to the right.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:24]** You got a single door down the hallway, and then the hallway splits at the end.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** It seems to go somewhere else.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:34]** Then up this hallway you're in, you have two sets of double doors, and then the hallway curves to the right, and you have two more doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** So there's a door to the right here?


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:38 - 01:02:02]** just like yeah around here because it looks like it could be a hallway so it's a hallway to a door it is a hallway let me just reveal a little bit so that way you can see kind of what's going on it is a little bit of a hallway see so you so you step up rick 19 starts to walk cautiously down the hall the flickering lights i actually ran ahead to get ahead of dr okay because dr okay was sprinting and

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:17]** And as you're going, I kind of picture that you're stepping in the large imprints from the dromaeosaurids where they left footprints on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** I would be stepping around the deep end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** You're one of those people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** I'm not going to step in there.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** I'm not trying to fill their boots.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:29]** You occasionally feel the rumble as a reminder that this place is still unstable.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** Let me reveal what you see down this first hallway to the right.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** You see... Rick raises his gun in that direction.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:39]** You see that the hallway continues down and extends.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** Let me do a little polygon reveal here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** There must be some chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** There appears to be some sort of chamber here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Called it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:55]** And more importantly, there appears to be... You can tell a little bit that it splits to the left and to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** I thought you said there was a door there.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** I'm confused.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** There is a door.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Do you see it?

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** Right in the middle-ish, kind of?

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** So in the middle of the hallway, there's a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:06]** Okay, so halfway down that long hallway, there's a door to the left.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:13]** And then there opens into... At the end of the hallway, it opens into a longer corridor going in perpendicular to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** Exactly.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** And as you go down that hallway...

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** There are this like, wait, we haven't gone to the hallway.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** Sorry.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:25]** As you can see down there, there are these rotating boxes.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:30]** You can see flickering in the light of like multicolored hues that are hanging from the ceiling.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:52]** rick shoots him okay not really no i'm kidding i'm kidding i should okay so what do you guys want to do and also how long is chad here for probably another probably got another two hours yeah so should we follow the pinging that you keep referring to or do you want to just find an exit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** Well, we didn't check Nico's body.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** Real quick, just what is he?

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:56]** Oh, well, we don't.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** I took his defects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** He took the defects.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** It's way better than the armor I had.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** He's got jump jets.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:02]** He's got some other weapons.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:04]** The armor already has jump jets in it.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** I need to add those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:05]** Oh, we already took it.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** Okay, good.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** I'm just making sure we took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:11]** You also have, as an android, you already have an upgrade slot in your body.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** I haven't used that, though, because I haven't had a chance to.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:17]** Right, but now you can, and you have an additional one because of the defects.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** I see what you're saying.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:22]** Okay, so Rick hears Dr. O.K.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Hears Dr. O.K.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** start to lead down the hall.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** They start walking ahead past the hallway.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** What are you guys saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:28]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]** I don't like where we are, guys.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:35]** I wanted to send Bernice ahead to see how long this hallway goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:41]** So the hallway to the right extends maybe 30 feet and then it ends.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** So there are really only two doors in that hallway that you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]** But this corner that I can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:47]** Right.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** So around the corner, it extends maybe 30 feet.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:50]** Then it dead ends.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** There are two doors.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:56]** One is a single paint door, single leaf.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:59]** The other is a broken door that appears to be dented in.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:02]** Here's as you step up.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:09]** and you get closer to these double doors, the first set on your left, you really start to sense.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** You don't even need a perception check.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:15]** You really start to sense the signal coming through.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Does Bernice pick up the signal?

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Yeah.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:22]** Does Bernice have a telepathic ability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** Doctor, okay, does Bernice pick up the signal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Not this sort of thing, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Maybe you start to hear it a little bit, Doctor, okay?

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** These doors are pretty big, heavy, and tight.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** Is it mysticism that I would understand this through?

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:39]** No, you literally start to hear it coming through the door a little bit.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:43]** Rick, as you step up, you're like, wait, maybe I hear it, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:47]** So, question, I mean, like, the music that you're playing...

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** We have heard this before.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:51]** Yes.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Like the audio music.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** Yeah, we have.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** Is that connected to what you're telling us is going on?

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Or is that just like good music?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** I think it's connected knowing John personally.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** Okay.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** I think it's probably like a huge plot point.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** John, I f***ed up.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** And what I meant to say was that I was going to use inject nanobots.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** So I didn't understand the spell correctly.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** So just heads up on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** Oh, so your spell is... Inject nanobots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** Instead of... Instead of mirror image.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** I totally misunderstood it.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:17]** No worries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** Secondly... So you're not doing mirror image?

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** I'm not doing mirror image.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** What does inject nanobots do?

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Yeah, tell us.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** All right, inject nanobots.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:24]** So you don't have to tell us.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:25]** It's fine.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** I can just look it up in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:29]** Yeah, but that's not as cool for the listeners who don't have the book right in front of them.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:30]** All right, listeners, so here's what it does.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** We should do a giveaway for people who don't have books.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** If you don't have a book, let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** We did, and... We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:38]** It was successful in a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** Yes, it was.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** In a way.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** Matt Dugas got the book.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** He did.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** But yes, you're right.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:46]** We should do another giveaway because this book is actually pretty legit.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** You concentrate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Do you want to read it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** No, I will read it by myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** You have to read it in a very intense voice.

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:07]** What you do is you concentrate key particles in your blood into tiny biological nanobots that you can inject into a foe with a touch, disrupting and damaging its natural processes.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:10]** You make a melee attack against the target's EAC.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:17]** If you hit, the nanobots deal 4d8 damage and swarm through the target's biological or mechanical systems.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:18]** What?

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:20]** causing the creature to be confused.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** For one round per your caster level, they're confused.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:29]** If the target succeeds at a fortitude save, it takes only half damage and negates the confusion effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:34]** And you got these nanobots from the damn monitor thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]** Let's just say that that is the case, story-wise.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:42]** It's a spell, though, that I guess anyone can get, or a technomancer can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** Because what did you do with the monitor?

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** Did you have the sunglasses?

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:49]** Because I remember Dr. K drinking... The sunglasses.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:51]** Fake drinking the soda.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** Dr. K had the toothpaste and the fusion fizz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:54]** Yeah.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** The toothpaste.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:55]** He actually did the toothpaste.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** Which there were nanobots in both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:01]** And I get a plus two to charisma, which I do have some skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:04]** And then you did... The sunglasses.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:09]** sunglasses and I went to another dimension temporarily.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** Make sure you still use that when you roll.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:15]** I think I have to get to like crit fail or something.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** So were those narrowbites as well?

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:19]** I don't think so.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:24]** But the point is that as a technomancer, I think you would have that intuition that you can create those.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:26]** Just create nanobots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]** I think that's pretty neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:32]** For that time period, I think you would be able to create them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** If we're talking story-wise and stuff.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** I'm just curious.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** There's a little bit more to this, so I'll just say this.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:45]** So there's a D100 that you roll for that confusion effect, and what you roll depends on what...

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:49]** Whatever you roll changes how that creature will affect and what its confusion will be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** 1 to 25 is act normally.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:55]** 26 to 50, do nothing but babble incoherently.

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:00]** 51 to 75, deal 1d8 plus strength modifier damage to self with item in hand.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:04]** And 76 to 100, attack nearest creature.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** That's basically it.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:08]** And here's also going to give the glove back to Dr. Okay.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Oh, thank you.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** Thank you, man.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** Thank you, Slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Good use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:20]** You did use... I've never wielded this, but next time I'll remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:24]** Yeah, but he used one use of the spell gem for Magic Missile.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:27]** How does Spelljump... Do they regenerate after a day?

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Well, there are five different gems.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:32]** We can look into how they regenerate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** I'll Google that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** So, what do you guys want to do?

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** This pinging is in your ears.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:39]** You have several options ahead of you.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:40]** What are you thinking?

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** What are you saying?

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:50]** I don't like how this tapping, ticking, pinging... I'm not sure.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:52]** And I'm going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:53 - 01:10:15]** direct bernice to stealthily enter that room spell gems is not in the index on this book enter i guess chad can go in there too and help out chad goes in yeah you've got control of chad right i do a couple things you go do i need to roll for still the thing is that we've established it's tough to open doors stealthily


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:23]** But the small size, I mean, there's no... Is it, like, perfectly sealed?

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** Like, how much... What is the largest gap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:27]** Oh, I see what you're saying.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:29]** You want to try and go through without the door being open?

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:31]** Or the smallest gap?

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:34]** I think the door's pretty well sealed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:46]** But let me... So, like, a chipmunk couldn't find, like, some panel somewhere and, you know, finagle their way in?

**[01:10:46 - 01:11:07]** yeah basically like it's a i would say it's a cloud of nanites suspended by an electromagnetic or electrostatic field that shifts and changes with like it can it can dissipate but it still has a core and it's like a hive based nanite neural net it's pretty small


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:30]** yeah i'm i'm gonna say with the it has zero bulk with the damage that's been done to the place in general it seems like it's there but maybe there's some micro damage that you can get through so maybe if it were a perfectly safe clean facility and door perfect in repair right it might be fine but since it's fractured i'm gonna say that you find a place kev your thoughts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:45]** So I'm just digging through the core rulebook, and under spell gems, it says each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded in the spell gem's lattice is forever expended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Okay, so magic missile is gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** But there's multiple charges, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** I thought there was, too, like a wand, but I guess not.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** I thought...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** A gem had multiple charges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:58]** I mean, you'd have to tell us if you gave us an item that had multiple charges or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:02]** I believe if we went back in the tape, you said there was like ten or five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** Well, there are five different spell gems.

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:07]** 600 charges per spell gem.

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:10]** But each spell gem might... It sounds like it only has one charge.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** All right, so Magic Missile's gone.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:14]** So, Dr.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:17]** O.K., you're Bernice for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:18]** It goes further.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** Sorry.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** This book is just so involved.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:25]** Only spellcasters are capable of using a spell, Jim.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:28]** But the glove lets a non-spellcaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** That's the point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** Okay, continue on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:34]** Okay, so Bernice is able, I think, to find the crack.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:36]** I feel like that makes sense.

**[01:12:36 - 01:13:02]** come in you see a couple of things do i need to roll stone i think bernice is able to come in in a stealthy way just to clatter new nights okay chad i don't think can come in because i think unless jack can move through and phase through doors i don't think jack you can open doors i guess bernice can phase through well bernice is coming through in like a microscopic crack and chad doesn't want to mess up the stealth so he's not gonna do that unless chad wants to open the door i'm gonna tell chad no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** Chat, don't open it.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Chat, no.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** Chat, no.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** No.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:07]** Now chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:11]** You see that this room...

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:14]** It's not too big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:14]** I don't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:17]** You sense a room.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** Let me change that then.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:24]** You sense a room that's maybe 30 feet across by 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:30]** I could probably like, I imagine basically like I'm looking at a sensor readout.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:34]** So I'm looking at like my, you know, screen or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:38]** And I see like sort of dimensions.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:38]** Yes.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:40]** But not like detail.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:40]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:45]** So I would say that you can see, again, 30 feet by 25 feet has some rounded corners.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:50]** You see that there's an object in the northwest corner of the room.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:53]** You see there's some sort of like I'm picturing like a radar a little bit.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:58]** You can see there's like a console of something in the opposite wall of the door.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:05]** And there also appears to be a series of like poles that are on the northern wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:08]** Wait, sorry, which door did Bernice go through?

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** The first of the double doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:09]** The one that we're in front of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:10]** Okay.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:14]** And so does it appear as if the two doors are connected?

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** No.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:18]** It seems like they are their own spaces.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:24]** But this room is the one where not only is Hears hearing this beacon, but Dr. O'Keefe and Rick...

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:28]** you are actually hearing something coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:29]** Do I sense any movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** You don't sense any movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:37]** And you said on the left side, there's probably a console against the back wall.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:40]** There's tubes or a pole of some sort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:42]** Against the northern wall, there's a pole.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:50]** In the northwest corner, there appears to be some sort of structure or statue or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** Okay.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:55]** Something that is just pinging as a large item.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:58]** And does Bernice hear this pinging?

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** I would think so.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:05]** If you're picking up audio signals, which I'm pretty sure you would be as a drone, you are now hearing this pinging.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:08]** And it seems to be coming from the consoles on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:19]** Bernice is going to stealthily move over to those consoles and initiate a sync.

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:19]** It's a computer console?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:21]** Yeah.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** Can you look at that?

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:23]** Yeah.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:28]** Give me a computers or engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** I can do either.

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:32]** Computers it is.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:32]** 20.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:34]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:38]** This is an Avidar Corp security station.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:39]** Pretty standard.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** There are no modifications.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:45]** If Nico were here, Nico would be like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** Can I turn this into, like... I've sold those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:51 - 01:16:00]** I know you want to prove this, but I'll turn it into... You realize, since you are not in the room, you can't see what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:02]** Well, I can see, like, a readout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:12]** Well, but... I'm interfacing with... Right, but what I'm saying is that the thing in the corner of the room appears to be some sort of robot.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:33]** attached to the security station in the northwest corner of the room can i um and what else 20 is good enough to realize that this console has two sides one is a comm station

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:38]** The other is a camera monitoring station.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:45]** The camera monitoring station seems to be suffering catastrophic damage.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:54]** The comm station seems to have numerous warnings and hailing attempts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:11]** I relay all this information to everyone and I say, guys, this may be more dire than we realize.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:21]** This is a security droid in here and some sort of console.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:25]** There was a communications array and it seems like maybe there's no connectivity.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:27]** Let me rephrase that.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:37]** The communications array, there are hailing messages pinging to this communications array.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:39]** Is that what these sounds are?

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:41]** The bong, bong, ping, ping?

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:41]** You would think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:49]** Can Bernice, through this console, communicate with the robot that is connected to it, the security joint?


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:54]** I think so.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:57]** What are you looking to do, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:58 - 01:18:00]** What is its status currently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:04]** Seems to be at a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:18]** Does it have any alert functions or conditional logic for its operation that it is yet to meet in its program loop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:20]** It seems to be inert and in a rest mode.


## Speaker_0

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:30]** That's probably about as much as you can tell without you going in and doing a further check to go into the diagnostics of the entire robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:33]** And it's a security droid?

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:37]** Can I pull up the recall knowledge on there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:42]** Give me another probably either computer engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:44]** Oh, okay, two.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:47]** So that gives me six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:49]** No, eight computers.

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:51]** Eight computer check.

**[01:18:52 - 01:19:00]** Seems to be, I mean, I'll just tell you, since you know already, seems to be a Gatekeeper Guardian robot.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]** From Avatar Corps?

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:04]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:08]** That's like enough to know that you're like, I've heard of that.

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:08]** Could we use this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:09]** Gatekeeper Guardian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:13]** To control the robot, it's a different set of functions.

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:16]** How do I do that?

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:22]** I think you would need to probably... I don't know if you could do that through Bernice or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:24]** Well, Bernice does have a computer skill.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:30]** So, I mean, Bernice is in the room, and there's nothing hostile, so can we just enter?

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:32]** Or you think the security bot will activate when you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:38]** I want to know if there's any security systems or other dangers in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:42]** You know that the gatekeeper security robots are a danger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:43]** Are a danger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:44]** Yeah.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:51]** Oh, so if I were to go into this room, I feel like I'm confident that this thing would attack us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:52]** Likely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:56]** Hey guys, there's a loaded gun behind this door.

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:59]** A security robot.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:01]** A guardian.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:03]** Gatekeeper.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:05]** Yeah.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** From Abadar Corp?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:13]** I am a strong follower of Abadar, and their security bots are definitely dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:19]** I'm surprised that there's Abadar technology on this place, and that was just great technology that we found so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** I too thought that.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:27]** Do you think it might be trapped here, or brought in for another purpose, perhaps, for experimenting on?

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:29]** We wouldn't know, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:30]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** I can speculate.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:32]** I can help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:35]** You communicate through that thing that you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:42]** Yes, we have a link, so to speak, and can communicate.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:44]** Well, I'm good at hacking if you need help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:46]** And you're good too, I guess, right?

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:46]** Yeah.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** It's an option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:50]** I mean, I just learned a lot about mechanics growing up.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:53]** I just never really applied myself until now.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** And, you know, now I'm a mechanic apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:02]** Well, I am pretty good at shooting things if worse comes to worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:07]** So I want to try and hack it and disable its function.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:09]** Is there any reason to actually enter that room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:15]** Those pings, I think, are going to that console in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:21]** That console has a lot of requests for hails.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:21]** Yeah.

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:23]** We could figure out what's going on.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:28]** We could maybe get more insight, but I really want to disable this drone.

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:29]** I agree.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:31]** This robot, if possible.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** Or, you know, parlay.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:33]** I don't know.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:35]** Let's try to disable it.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:35]** I vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:37]** I concur.

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:38]** Let's move forward.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:39]** Tired of fighting robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:46]** So I'm going to instruct Bernice to do a computer check to try and hack the robot security.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:49]** I have plus six for Bernice on computers.

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:51]** That's pretty good.

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:53]** Does Bernice have a different computer than you do?

**[01:21:53 - 01:21:53]** Yeah.

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:55]** Oh.

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:56]** I've never worked with the drones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:57]** I don't know.

**[01:21:57 - 01:21:59]** I think I will say this.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:04]** You are aware that the gatekeeper robot has been modified, right?

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:05]** By the greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:07]** Or by something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:07 - 01:22:08]** It's been modified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** We don't know by whom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:14]** So... It would make sense if the greys... It would make sense that it's been modified, possibly by greys.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:15]** F***ing greys.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:19]** I think you would need probably... You said you have a plus six?

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:23]** I'm going to... I think it's fair to keep that respective to the roll.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:27]** You get one chance to roll and see if you can hack into it.

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:34]** That doesn't mean that you can control it, but you can move into its mainframe and operate it and look at what's going on.

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:36]** Like its command structure and all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:42]** Yeah, and I think on the fly... I mean, if you guys command it to pause and then we can charge in and actually hack it, that might... Well, you would know a couple things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:46]** You would know that, one, that gatekeeper security robots don't attack immediately.

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:49]** They are observant robots...

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:53]** That can track targets and determine what's going on with them.

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:54]** So it might not attack.

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:55]** It might one.

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** It doesn't just attack immediately when it comes in.

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:05]** But I think a DC 25, meaning a 19 or 20, meaning that Bernice needs to nail it.

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:16]** I think that's a fair thing for you to be operating a newly found drone in another room that you can't see through one comm that's connected to a robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:21]** Is there anything negative with failing this check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:27]** I don't think there is because the robot is looking for, logically, the robot is looking for people in the room.

**[01:23:28 - 01:23:32]** And Bernice is a cloud that I think... It's an amorphous blob of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:50]** wisp yeah i give you one chance well they're doing a sequel well here's the thing though yeah i have a feat that allows you to oh my god to try at a failed skill check

**[01:23:51 - 01:24:16]** again uh i'll have to look it up hold on funny there is thing but uh i think it's called communal no that's something else that's my thing maybe i didn't take it now i can't find it is it communalism no it's just for it's like a yeah okay i'm just gonna roll it okay i'm gonna roll crack tie that doesn't count okay

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:20]** You try to go through.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:23]** Bernice, what did you roll?

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:26]** I rolled a 5, so I got an 11.

**[01:24:26 - 01:24:29]** Bernice thought that she was going down one route.

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:33]** Turns out to not be the route where the communications to the robot exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:36]** I assisted with that to make a difference, right, for a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:37 - 01:24:38]** Yeah.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:39]** It was a 9, sorry, right?

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:40]** 5.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:40]** It was a 5.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:42]** 5 on the die.

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:43]** Plus 6, 11, plus 13.

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:44]** Yeah, no, you needed a 25.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:50]** And I didn't take the... I buffed something else.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:53]** I buffed stealth, stupidly, and life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:54]** It's alright.

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:55]** It's not stupid.

**[01:24:55 - 01:24:56]** You don't know what's in there.

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:57]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:58]** You're standing outside.

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:00]** You're looking through Bernice.

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:06]** It makes sense that maybe you're not quite accustomed to working with a drone just yet.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:08]** You were able to get inside, which is a win.

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:10]** You were able to detect the room, which is a win.

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:14]** You couldn't quite do everything, but it makes sense that you were able to try.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:19]** And it's pretty sweet because you couldn't look into rooms before.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:21]** Yeah.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:23]** But you have Bernice now and you also have Chad.

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:24]** So you're standing in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:25 - 01:25:45]** ground is rumbling what do you want to do i will stand point and he literally has his gun just kind of do you even want to go in i need to rest i feel so drained we could rest that would i'd be willing to go in if we rest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:47 - 01:25:48]** But it's got to be a long rest.

**[01:25:49 - 01:25:51]** I got to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:53]** I'm not sure we have time for a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:56]** Well, I think this is the source.

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:58]** I think we need to go in here.

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:00]** Probably.

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:08]** So I could send Chad in and see if it activates the bot.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:32]** well chad's not seen right just tell chad open i don't know if it's gonna like get up and move around chad go point go push buttons on the robot that's all you know is gonna go next to the robot behind it okay and stealthily but also like so it doesn't necessarily know i don't know if i need to do stealth or not roll a self-check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:26:34 - 01:26:35]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:36 - 01:26:37]** Okay, 17.

**[01:26:37 - 01:26:38]** You start to move behind it.

**[01:26:39 - 01:26:40]** Seems like it's fine.

**[01:26:40 - 01:26:41]** What do the rest of you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:46]** Chad opens the door nearest the bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:52 - 01:26:53]** Opens up.

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:57]** You all are able to see inside.

**[01:27:02 - 01:27:04]** Let me reveal the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:06]** I'm not sure what the role is for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:08 - 01:27:09]** How many portals open up?

**[01:27:09 - 01:27:10]** Yeah.

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:11]** Lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:14]** The door opens up.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:17]** And you see, I'll tell you what you see.

**[01:27:18 - 01:27:28]** You see bright purple, red, and blue lights blinking in a repeating pattern that matches with this sound on the computer console that Bernice was working into.

**[01:27:29 - 01:27:30]** That's across from the doorway.

**[01:27:31 - 01:27:35]** This whistling is emanating from the console every few seconds.

**[01:27:37 - 01:27:38]** The right side of the console is dark.

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:41]** That's probably the camera monitoring side.

**[01:27:41 - 01:27:44]** Catastrophically damaged.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:47]** The wall is scorched behind it.

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:54]** You see in the northern wall there are a series of poles that jut up from the floor.

**[01:27:55 - 01:28:04]** Each of them have a metal collar and line with a dozen small cuffs running the length of both sides of the poles.

**[01:28:04 - 01:28:09]** And in the northwest corner stands what you now know as the Abadar Gatekeeper Robot.

**[01:28:10 - 01:28:19]** It's some sort of machine with a spherical base connected to a narrow apparatus that has this humanoid strip on top.

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:23]** And I just revealed the room here.

**[01:28:23 - 01:28:26]** Sorry, it's the north... Right here.

**[01:28:28 - 01:28:28]** Okay.

**[01:28:28 - 01:28:31]** These poles, these four poles, have these cuffs on them.

**[01:28:32 - 01:28:34]** You have this...

**[01:28:36 - 01:29:00]** console here the right side is damaged and the left side has this whistle is it possible to sneak in past the sensors for this guard bot how would i know you can try i mean uh can i do like a computer's check you could do like a physical science or life science or something on the robot itself to see if they're pretty observant or not the door's open and this bot hasn't seen us yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:01 - 01:29:04]** It's probably not programmed to do anything about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:29:04 - 01:29:07]** Well, you could just look at it and find out with life science, right?

**[01:29:07 - 01:29:07]** More or less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:07 - 01:29:11]** Well, it's a physical object, so it'd be physical science, right?

**[01:29:11 - 01:29:12]** Construct.

**[01:29:12 - 01:29:14]** I could do a physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:14 - 01:29:14]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:16 - 01:29:18]** Ooh, 18 on the die?

**[01:29:18 - 01:29:19]** That's 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:24]** They are observant robots, but you think this robot won't react until you enter the room.

**[01:29:25 - 01:29:27]** And even then, it might not react right away.

**[01:29:27 - 01:29:28]** I got a 5+.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:28 - 01:29:30]** It might be delayed.

**[01:29:30 - 01:29:32]** It might be safe for a moment to enter the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:29:33 - 01:29:37]** However, I don't trust it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:38 - 01:29:50]** Rick, here's what you're saying, and he's pretty confident in his abilities to stealth, but he rolled a nine, but he attempts to sneak in to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:50 - 01:29:51]** Okay, he rolled a nine.

**[01:29:51 - 01:29:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:53 - 01:29:54]** He's got his gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:29:55 - 01:29:58]** Hears is stealthily walking over to the robot.

**[01:29:58 - 01:29:59]** He rolled a 17 for stealth.

**[01:30:01 - 01:30:01]** Okay.

**[01:30:01 - 01:30:03]** He's going to try to hack the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:03 - 01:30:04]** Okay.

**[01:30:05 - 01:30:06]** You walk over to the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:06 - 01:30:09]** And Bernice will assist.

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:11]** It sees Rick.

**[01:30:11 - 01:30:12]** I know.

**[01:30:12 - 01:30:13]** It's being hacked by Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:13 - 01:30:16]** It's a lot of roll for the assist.

**[01:30:16 - 01:30:17]** Dr. K is standing outside.

**[01:30:17 - 01:30:19]** Yeah, roll for the assist.

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:20]** Stealthing right in front of his face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:20 - 01:30:21]** Bernice assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:22 - 01:30:23]** What did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:23 - 01:30:27]** I rolled a 17 for stealth, but I'm literally in front of his face, so I don't know how stealthy that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:30]** Come on, you've played Skyrim or Fallout.

**[01:30:30 - 01:30:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:30:31 - 01:30:33]** You can just, like, squat and walk in front of anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:36]** I was thinking of that while I was here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:37]** I was like, yeah.

**[01:30:37 - 01:30:39]** Okay, so you walk in, get up.

**[01:30:40 - 01:30:43]** Bernice starts to swarm into the robot to assist.

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:47]** What are you rolling for your computer, Sean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:47]** Go.

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:50]** All right, so... Oh, my God.

**[01:30:50 - 01:30:52]** I have plus 12 computers, but I rolled a 14.

**[01:30:53 - 01:30:54]** With the plus 12.

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:54]** Oh.

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:55]** So it's pretty good.

**[01:30:55 - 01:30:57]** No, it's 14.

**[01:30:57 - 01:30:57]** Oh, 16.

**[01:30:57 - 01:30:58]** With the assist.

**[01:30:58 - 01:31:00]** With the assist, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:02]** Because a 14 plus 12 is pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:03]** That would be great if that were the case.

**[01:31:03 - 01:31:04]** Yeah, that would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:04]** Yeah.

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:06]** A 2 plus 12 is 14.

**[01:31:06 - 01:31:07]** That's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:11 - 01:31:13]** As you come up to it, Dr. O.K.

**[01:31:13 - 01:31:14]** is standing outside.

**[01:31:15 - 01:31:16]** Rick is in the corner.

**[01:31:16 - 01:31:22]** Here's... This is standing in front of the robot.

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:22]** Okay.

**[01:31:23 - 01:31:25]** Bernice swarms in.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:28]** Here's you.

**[01:31:29 - 01:31:31]** You try and look for some sort of panel.

**[01:31:32 - 01:31:34]** You find something maybe that you can open.

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:40]** And as you do, this red LED comes across the screen.

**[01:31:44 - 01:31:46]** and sees you.

**[01:31:47 - 01:31:49]** Uh-huh.

**[01:31:49 - 01:31:50]** And that's our game.

**[01:31:50 - 01:31:51]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:51 - 01:31:52]** That's it.

**[01:31:52 - 01:31:54]** Rick opens fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:55]** Rick opens fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:56 - 01:31:56]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:56 - 01:31:58]** Oh, boy.

**[01:32:04 - 01:32:07]** John Swan here with the hot question for you.

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:12]** For GMs, how do you balance your encounters?

**[01:32:12 - 01:32:20]** Do you give a lot of thought to the design and the choice of the creatures or to what actions they'll probably likely take round by round?

**[01:32:21 - 01:32:23]** And for players, how do you like your combat?

**[01:32:23 - 01:32:31]** Do you like having a slog like with Dark Souls and you have to really think smart and be smart and play smart in order to win?

**[01:32:31 - 01:32:34]** Or is the combat secondary and

**[01:32:34 - 01:32:40]** And it only serves the climax or the roleplay or the circumstances surrounding it.

**[01:32:40 - 01:32:52]** For me, it really makes the game interesting when I get to dig into each combatant's motivations and what potential actions they might take based on their stat block.

**[01:32:52 - 01:33:00]** And I think as a player, it helps to set up interesting and varying combat with different levels of difficulty or conditions.

**[01:33:00 - 01:33:03]** There's a really great book called The Monsters Know What They're Doing.

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:07]** That's for fifth edition D&D, but I think every handler should read it.

**[01:33:08 - 01:33:14]** It gives you the keys to look at a stat block and know what creatures might do and make your combat interesting.

**[01:33:14 - 01:33:24]** And finally, I just want to say thank you so much for making this year, 2021, so fun and fantastic, laughing with us, listening to us, sharing us.

**[01:33:24 - 01:33:26]** We really appreciate it.

**[01:33:26 - 01:33:32]** We have so many cool things planned for 2022 that we're really excited to share with you.

**[01:33:32 - 01:33:37]** So until then, have a happy, safe, and wonderful new year.
