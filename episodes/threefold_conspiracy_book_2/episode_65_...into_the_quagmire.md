**[00:00:00 - 00:00:13]** Previously on Will Save, our intrepid adventurers prepare themselves for a final showdown against the big bad terrible green monster lurking at the bottom of the ladder well.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:24]** And after a pep talk from Hrog, the gang squares off against the terrifying two-headed troll who is not happy to see our team as he bellows, ''Get out!''

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:35]** But not before our fear-filled fellows disable the reactor, which requires two people to operate its terminals in order to terminate the station's sanitation protocols.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:45]** In an impressive move, Colin Imbrand casts Reflecting Armor on himself while stepping towards the big bad monster, despite the psychic terror around him.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:55]** But it's Rick19 that takes the first blow from the two-headed terribleness, using its incredible reach to strike the bloodthirsty bot for an unrolled amount of damage.

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Will our adventurer survive this foray into this terror-filled territory?

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:05]** Or is this troll about to claim its first casualty?

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:09]** Find out this time on WillSafe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:08]** Hello and welcome to episode 65 of We'll Save Wednesday.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:17]** If you're not listening on a Wednesday, that's all right, because you're still here for the best show in town, We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:25]** I'm going to put in a clip of a bunch of people cheering and guns going off and loud celebration at that point.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Wow.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Yeah.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** And I'm excited.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Did you not hear that?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Yeah.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** I heard it in the background here.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Yeah.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Yeah.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** I heard, yeah, there's a massive crowd outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** Gunshots were recorded live outside of Will's house.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:44]** Hey, so just want to take the moment to introduce somebody new to the show.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:53]** Somebody that's really... The past few episodes here in our recording sessions, they've really brought out just a wonderful perspective.

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:00]** Some would say that it's almost mathematical in the way that they view things.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** And I've just been so happy.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** And I'm very excited to welcome to the show our friend,

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Yeah, Dice Cam.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Thanks for all you do.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** So happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Thanks, guys.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** I'm Dice Cam.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Dice Cam.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** It's nice to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** How does it feel to be officially recognized as a cast member of We'll Save the Podcast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:30]** Well, it was tough going for a while, but I've really come into my stride lately, and I feel like I'm going to be a helpful part of the team, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I think you are.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Thank you so much.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** Does anyone else have questions for Dice Cam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:42]** Just for the listeners, in case you don't know if it's not obvious, the Dice Cam is a cam that's focused on the dice tray that Will has.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** And it's awesome.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** It's kind of self-explanatory.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Is it?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** I don't know.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** I just want to say that.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** This is an audio-only medium at this moment.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** We have to add Dice Cam's bio to the website.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** We'll add Dice Cam's bio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** Dice Cam, can you give us a quick bio?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Right now in the moment of your life?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Yeah, tell us about yourself.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** So far, I've been green-felt.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Oh, I don't have a favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** What's your favorite type of dice to have rolled?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Do you like the hard publishing metal kind?

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** What material?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** What material metal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** Definitely CNC metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** I have some of those.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** I can throw some of those at you sometime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, I've got some here too.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** I really like it when Bernice rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** You're a naughty dice cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** Kelly is really getting into this Dice Cam.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Yeah.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** It's fine.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** You know what?

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** There's no kink shaving here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** I appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** Can you give Kelly Dice Cam's phone number?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Maybe later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:19]** I'll just come over and see it myself.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** Just take Dice Cam out to dinner.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** Let's see how far this goes.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** Kelly, where are you taking Dice Cam out to dinner?

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** What are you going to do on your first date?

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** Okay, well, there's a couple good game board cafes around.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** You can probably take Dice Cam there.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** They have sandwiches and some lattes.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** That'd be kind of nice, right?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:42]** Dice Cam, are you into... Do you have any... Can you drink?

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** Do you have any orifices by which you can consume nutrition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:50]** I don't really like liquids on me or around me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Oh, on you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Because it makes my...

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** Leather, not as nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** I don't know.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:06]** I feel like that would actually... I'm not trying to gaslight you, DiceCam, but I feel like it would be better to have some kind of moisturizing liquid on the leather.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** It's good in the long run for the leather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Maybe.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** We can discuss later, maybe, over... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I don't know if it's going to work out with DiceCam.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** I feel like we want different things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** Yeah, I think I'll do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Break it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** You're not even going on your first date.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Yeah, you have to go on your first date.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** It sounds like you're not going to, things are going to work out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:33]** And already Dice Game is super high maintenance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** What a love story.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** You love to see it.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** You love to stand Dice Game and Kelly.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** Welcome to the show, Dice Games.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Good to have you.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** Sounds like Teen Girl Squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:57]** You're definitely a cheerleader from Teen Girl Squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** What a classic topic.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:14]** Yeah, so we're very happy because as we progress in our video skills, Will has brought on the Fantabulous Dice Cam in the OBS system software and has a beautiful setup right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** No.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:35]** trickery here uh this is just a simple green screen chroma key yep i'm impressed by your skills impress it looks like it was pointed out uh by kev i think at one point that it looked like a vhs like recording

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** No, I think it was Kelly, but he was right.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:37]** Maybe it was Kelly.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Oh, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** Because we asked if it was a filter, and you were like, no, it's actually just my camera.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** It's just the Elgato face cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** No burn there.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** Total VHS definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** VHS glory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:57]** It was like the premium camera from 1985.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** Big camcorder.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** The ones that dads were always walking around with at Disneyland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** My dad made himself a roller.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** He had a box of wheels and then the stand was attached to it.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:16]** He would be able to roll it out to our soccer games and have the stand with it with extra tapes in the bottom and extra batteries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** My dad had a full-size...

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:44]** a vhs one that had a like hip bag and then a cable that ran to another camcorder basically but it was like you know offsets and you didn't have to like tire your shoulder out you know carrying around a blunken huge camcorder just had to have a giant backpack that had a really sensitive vs vcr in it recorder


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:51]** I think that's how we should record any future live show that we do.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** We need to invest in a VHS recorder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** I hope my dad still has that somewhere.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** I'll try to find it.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** And then I'm going to roll that out to Grayson's first soccer game.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** And everybody, including other parents, are going to be like, what the f*** is that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** Maybe we can see if Orion at Sweetwater can give us one.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** We can see if they have any back in the back part of the warehouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Way in the back.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Dust them off and send them our way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** Can I take this brief moment to provide a PSA to our listeners?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Please.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:28]** Your VHS tapes, you should back them up, and not just to DVDs, but to the cloud.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** Because both VHS and DVDs wear out over time.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** So heads up.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:41]** Put those on some external hard drives and also on the cloud so you can guarantee your family memories stay memories forever.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** Brought to you by Will Save Production Company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** Corporate.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Burn them all.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Subset of the umbrella, Will Save the Network.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** For the ones that you're ashamed of, you can burn those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:55]** The lifetime of a VHS tape is only like 25 or 30 years.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:00]** After that, the magnetism on the tape starts to wear out.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** The tracking gets weird.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Is that true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** I mean, we're 30 years away from 1992.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:16]** I was digitizing some tape for my father-in-law, and some of those captures are a little jittery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** All my memories are dead then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:25]** I think we're just about the age where we need to start doing it right now with all the VHS.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** I did it recently.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:27]** It paid off.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:28]** Cool.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** Well, I think instead of recording today, I'm going to go digitize some VHS tapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:39]** I think I'm just going to clean out all my DVDs and VHSes and start backing them all up to the cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** I think so.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** That's all of episode 65, folks.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Thanks again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** I'm sorry.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Still bring information.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** She's got us off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Yeah, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** I gotta go right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Do you know where your VHS tapes are?

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** It's 2022.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** Speaking of sobering information, don't we have a big freaking troll to deal with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** We do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** We do.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** I'm actually looking forward to it.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** I feel like this is going to be a fun boss fight.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** I feel like we're going to kick its ass.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** It's just going to take like episodes of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Well, I'll be laying on the floor on the corner.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** So wake me up when you guys beat it.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** When September ends.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:19]** I figured out who he, she, it, they reminds me of.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Who is it?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** Have you seen Shang-Chi?

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** Yes.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** No.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Abomination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** I can see that.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Kelly, you've got to see.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Two-headed Abomination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Two-headed Abomination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** I just saw Batman last night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** No, don't tell me anything about it.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** I still haven't seen it.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** Six weeks after release and I can't find a babysitter.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** You can tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** what you thought, because Kev's not going to like it.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** Hands down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** No, I think I'm going to love it from all the stuff I've been hearing about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:58]** Yeah, it's fine, actually, but Robert Pattinson, I felt like I was back in 2006 in my emo days.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:05]** It seems like it was from 2006, with certain aspects of it, because he's just going around being my chemical romance the entire time.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** But I won't say anything else other than that.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** Does he turn her into a vampire at the end?


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** Sparkly skin and everything.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Is her last name Swan?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** Yeah, she's from Jacksonville, Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Isabella Swan?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Was that her name in Twilight?

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** I haven't seen Twilight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** In Twilight, she was named Isabella Swan.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** She lived or was from Jacksonville, Florida.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Was she really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** She was mostly based off of John.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:36]** Well, her stepdad played for the then Jacksonville Suns, now Jumbo Shrimp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** That is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:47]** The vampire's father played for the Jacksonville Suns and vampires can't go in the sun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Bella lives with her dad in Washington.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:59]** Her mom still lives in Jacksonville with her new husband who is a minor league baseball player who's not a vampire.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** He's just a dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** He's just a dude.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** Just a dude, but he'd probably lose against the vampire baseball when they play that baseball game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** They're really strong, apparently.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** I'd buy that ticket.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** They can only play at night.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** That's true.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Schedule day games.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** You'll never have to worry about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** It was a cloudy day game.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** That's why it's the Pacific Northwest.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Seems so depressing.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Should we play?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Let's play!

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** That was supposed to be something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Wait, we'll play that drop again.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** There it is.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** That's the official.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** No, it isn't.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Okay.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** He's like, no, no, it's not.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** Well, let me just, let me just go over a few things before we start here.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** Cause I do want to do a super short recap, but I really want to get into it.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** But I do want to say two things.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:56]** And that's one, that with the roll that we ended episode 64 on, I hit Kev with a 34.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** And there's a slight correction that I would like to make.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** And that is that I actually rolled a 33.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:07]** So just want to make it clear.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I rolled a 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** That's it.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** But you didn't roll a natural 20.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Nope.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** So this 33 could be from anywhere between one.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Oh, no, that'd be a critical fail.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** So anywhere from two to 19.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** That is how dice work.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Gave you a 33.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:27]** Also, I want to point out that, Kev, at the top of your turn, I listen back.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** We should have...

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:34]** Had you make a... We'll save.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:38]** Because of the... We'll save!

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** I thought you did too, but then I was listening back and I don't think that you did.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** Because Colin made one right at the start of Colin's turn.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Colin passed.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** But I don't think you did.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** So just keep that in the old Android noggin.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Keep that going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** Kev looks salty at what I'm saying.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** He's not even replying.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** He's so upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** There it is.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** That's what I wanted.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** He's like, yeah.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Yep.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:05]** Yep.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:05]** Yep.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** What's up?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** I think we can kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** I think we can do this, guys.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:16]** I do want to ask you before, because once I start the recap, we are going.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** And I just want to ask, do you guys feel ready?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** No.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Sounds like you do.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** Of course not.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** No.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:24]** I think this is going to be the shortest character life in podcast history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** Colin's just going to stand out in front.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Don't worry, guys.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** I've got this.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** So whatever your shots die.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** That was pretty good.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** That was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** That was a really good Colin, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** I was impressed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** I think we do.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** I know it's going to be a hard fight.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** I don't know if I'm optimistic, but I'm excited.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** I have spells.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** I'm excited.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** I think this is going to be a fun enemy to fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:56]** I would be better off if John didn't cheat on the last fight and make me lose 28 points for no reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** What if we can befriend this troll, too?

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Fair enough.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** That's true, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:08]** It's like the end of Scott Pilgrim where he's going to fight Nega Scott and they just come out and get brunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Should we do something next week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Yeah.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** He's a really nice guy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** I'm having a hard time with this door.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Do you guys mind helping me get the door open?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** You're fine.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** I was actually trying to shut it off.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Trying to help you guys out.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** It's a good happy hour nearby, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** It's important to talk through your problems first.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:35]** You never know what the other person wants or what they're going for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Don't make assumptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:43]** I think Starfinder 2nd Edition should have that as an optional variant rule at the start of every combat.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:46]** You can ask what your needs and wants are out of this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** What are your love languages?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** What are your love languages?

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** What are your combat languages?

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** You know, I think that's fine.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** I think it's fine.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Okay, we have one person on board.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Will.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** Will is on board.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:21]** So what began as an awakening and a strange escape pod quickly turned into an endless nightmare, a constant state of fear, danger and paranoia as every door, every room and every step could be your last.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** And in fact, for one of you, it was.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:32]** Flash forward to this moment, past combat, past exploration, past all that danger and paranoia come true.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:46]** You have descended into the reactor control room outside of the nuclear reactor on the verge of a meltdown.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** Now, to your right, I'm going to give you guys a reminder.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Because I think you're on the landing page right now.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:54]** To your right are two workstations.

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:01]** One is a smoky crystal machine that you know requires a telepathic connection or mind link ability, right?

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Or...

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** The other is a manual computer station.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Now, both of these are linked.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:20]** This was something that I believe it was Rick 19, I believe, found out, intimated, and that you realize that you'll probably need access to both in order to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** That's the word that Rick used.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** What?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** Yeah, Rick used that word, intimated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** Okay.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** I knew it.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** I knew I got it from somewhere.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** So here's the thing.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** This would all be a piece of cake if you didn't have something standing in your way.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:49]** And that something is a large, monstrous, leprous, as Colin put it, two-headed troll that was pounding and scraping at the reactor doors to get in.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** And you all descended into this octagonal room.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:58]** Let me bring you over and give you a reminder that you're stepping on these grates.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:08]** And you can see that these grates have some sort of a beneath are a bunch of conduit pipes and that could act as a sort of floor.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:14]** And I will say that there is a good amount of airspace beneath these grates.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:22]** Now to your left is the troll along with four nuclear rods that I'm sure have a purpose that only Kevin knows.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:26]** And they are bright green, illuminating the room.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** And then four pillars.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Just like real life.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Just like real life.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** Yep.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:42]** And four pillars that have orange or that have purple LEDs around them, illuminating them as well as illuminating the ladder in the center of the room that you all came down to.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** And I'm going to go to my initiative tracker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** It really kind of bothers me.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:49]** It's so close to reality.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** I don't know what Paizo did, but they really shouldn't be releasing this kind of information.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:58]** The purple LEDs, the green glowing tubes, and the mind links with our computers.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** That's exactly what we used.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:03]** And the troll that guards it as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** Yeah, we talked about the troll.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:11]** Yeah, we talked about the troll that Kev has to deal with every time he wants to get in trouble with Kevin.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** Kev, do you think the Navy plays Starfinder?

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Because if they did, they would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:20]** I know a few Navy people, at least one, that plays Starfinder.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** I know a couple other guys from the Navy that play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** There are two dead greys near the workstation.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:34]** Frog, Bernice, Dr. OK, on the northeast ladder coming down.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Here's southeast.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:42]** Colin took a step forward to the troll, and I believe put on reflecting armor, right?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** That was the spell that you cast?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Love it.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** It is.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** And I didn't move.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** We'll see if he lives to regret it.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Yeah.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:55]** And Rick 19 started to take steps over towards the southern wall.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** And we're going to kick off with some combat music.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:04]** And I rolled to take an attack of opportunity against Rick 19 with this extended reach.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:12]** And I'm going to tell you, Colin and Rick, what you see happen is you see the troll blur.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:25]** Almost as if it was like starting to move into this quantum superposition state and very nearly teleports the five feet or so away to be to be in front of Rick 19.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** And there are conditions for what's up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:34]** Sorry, I was just saying, like, why can't he just use his big f***ing legs?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** He has to teleport five feet?

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Sorry.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Just to be a creepy f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:47]** Imagine this huge creature, like, just leaning forward and one leg starting to step and smash onto the grates below.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:53]** And then right as it is about to hit, it just blurs and kind of, like, moves forward five feet.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** And then the foot hits in front right next to Rick.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Oh, my God.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** Yeah, so let's resolve this AOL.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:06]** I roll the 33 against Rick19, and I'm going to roll for damage.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Let's see how much damage you get.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** As with the momentum of the step, this troll just rolls.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:28]** just swings out with this massive claw and hits you for 15 points of damage as it strikes into you, slamming you against the metal wall behind you.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:37]** And again, this metal wall has these divots, these half-hemispherical convex circles coming out of the wall.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:42]** So you're kind of pushed against it, your head hits it, and you leave a dent.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** In the wall.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** Yikes.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Yikes.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Damn.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Indeed.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** It is your turn, Rick19.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** And as we talked about, I think you need to roll a will save.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:01]** I don't recall, like, metagame-wise, what we said we were doing with this thing.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** Were we taking a stance of, like, this is not for you, John.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:09]** This is A-B conversation to see your way out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** I haven't heard that one in a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:21]** Did we talk about just trying to kill this thing, or are we talking about... I thought we were going to try and disable the reactor that probably powers the monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:37]** If I remember correctly, I think it was going to be Colin and Rick19 were going to stay engaged with the monster, and then Bernice and Dr. Okay and maybe Hears were going to try to do the computer stuff while we kept... Because we're all computer people.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Exactly.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:39 - 00:24:01]** we're all part of the green that's what's up i think i think this uh trolls got some radioactive power that could be uh turned off from this computer over here let's do it uh here's just kind of like sweat drops that he saw at the teleporting that he saw and then yeah okay it's not his turn though but when it's his turn it's gonna be yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** My roll is incredibly weak.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Terrible things.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** What a way to start.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** I rolled a three for a total of seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Seven.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** It was a DC 10.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** I think I mentioned that before.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** Maybe the teleportation just, you were not expecting that.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** And it just broke your will.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:27]** So you are going to, for one round, minus one penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** What is the condition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** there's not a name for the condition.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** It's just a minus one penalty to attack rolls and skill checks.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** That's not the worst thing.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:44]** You'll get a chance at the start of your next turn to try and overcome that fear, let's call it.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:47]** It's not actually fear.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** It's not a fear effect in that mechanical sense.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:56]** It is from the vague and growing sense of dread that you felt upon coming in the area now that you're taking an attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** Wait, is this the will save we did up in the...

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Up at the shaft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Did you do the same effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yes.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** I don't think you did because then Colin still had to roll it.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Yeah, because he didn't come in yet.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:17]** It was Hears and Rick came into the room first and felt the dread.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:42]** and i i think i failed it back then i'd have to go back in the notes it doesn't matter whatever minus one um so now it's my turn this is because it was on my move action yep um and since i got attacked on that way like right as this thing starts swinging at him rick swaps to his his axe because now he's in the uh reach of this thing right am i still gonna have to go in you still don't have reach against him though right right

**[00:25:42 - 00:26:04]** me man but if i shoot at him now then it's gonna he's gonna get another no he doesn't get another because he used to use it so i'm gonna keep my i'm keeping my artillery laser out um i'm gonna pull out my tiny little uh poltergeist die from kraken um because it rolled well for me the other day it's probably gonna roll terrible because i'm recording and that's how that works um

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** And I'm going to shoot at this thing with all my might.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Give it all your might.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** Artillery laser is a plus eight to hit.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** It looks like a 9 plus 8 for 17.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** EAC.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Because it's an artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Yes!

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** At least something's going well.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** That's going to be a D12.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Nope, sorry.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** That's an artillery laser.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** It's a D10.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** D10.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** This is a 10?

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** Yes, D10 plus 4.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Four.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** That's a nine on the dice.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** And that's a 13 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Dang.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** Okay.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:01]** 14 total as you fire off this blast that hits the creature.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** Impressive.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Impressive, impressive, impressive.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:14]** Blowing into their weird, sinuous, thick, pulpy, fleshy shoulder.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:21]** And I think a little bit of goo maybe gets on your gun from this gross troll body.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Gross.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** 14 points of damage.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** Give me one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:34]** One of the leprous sores is just like... Disgusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Got it.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** So, it is its turn.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** Unless you want to do anything else with your turn, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** That's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Solid turn, though.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** I don't have any swift action skills, I don't think.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** But 14 points of damage is a good start.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** Right after that happens, it's the troll's turn.

**[00:27:54 - 00:28:01]** You see that some of the troll's flesh knits back together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** Screw you, self-healing enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** I'm just trying to play by the rules.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:11]** You said this thing had some kind of quantum something or other, so was I supposed to roll a concealment roll or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** You're good to go.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Woo!

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:20]** You nearly brought that up, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Wow.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** I should have said nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** You should have said nothing, dude.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** But I'm an honest person.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** What are you saying?

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** What were you trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Let's make this more difficult, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** They talked about the blood that we found was like quantum something or other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** Meaning that the blood was shifting.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** It's how he moved a step during his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:45]** He's somehow able to travel beyond our dimension through some other plane.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Yeah, and I thought we thought something similar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:56]** We talked about it, where it was like, if we go take a shot at this thing, it's almost equivalent to... It's like what here is experienced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** It's that same phenomenon, right?

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Glitch.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** John?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Sorry.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** Cause that's why it's that same phenomenon that here's experience where you can move through like different dimensions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Kind of, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** You just had that experience at the top of the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** A little bit, a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:18]** There were also like those, the, the crystal dogs that could just like phase through doors and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** All right.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** With that arm, the troll looks at that arm and grimaces.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:33]** You see part of the shoulder knit itself back together.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:38]** Another few sores pop out right where you had hit it with that laser.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** And then it just...

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Thanks, Yul.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:53]** Just stretches its shoulder in a circle and then swings, takes a step forward, which might... I don't think it incurs an AOL from Colin because I think you're still five feet away.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** I think I'm adjacent to it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** He's moving away from the threaten square.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** You are five feet away, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** You're the DM.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** What's the question?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** It's your ruling.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:11]** If you tell me I'm over five feet, then I'm over five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** I think you're over five feet.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** I thought he moved up to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** I mean, I moved up adjacent to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** When it was here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Are you saying you get an attack of opportunity?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** You do.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** You should get an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** Well, it was already here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** So then... No, it did that during the attack of opportunity, you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:31]** So as it moved for the attack of opportunity, it invoked an attack of opportunity from Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Is that how that works?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:35]** No, not with the teleport.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Right.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:40]** But he teleported from one adjacent square to another adjacent square, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Yeah, but with the teleport, you don't.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** Unless... Let me clarify this.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:52]** Unless you have blindsight or true seeing or can see invisible...

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** I have none of those things.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** You know, actually, I think he's going to stay right where he is and take a swing because he has 10 foot reach.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:10]** So he's going to lean forward and strike again at Rick 19.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Let's see if they hit with a claw.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** That is a 21.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** Nope, 22.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Two.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** To hit?

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** To hit against KAC on Rick19.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Okay.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Why is that even funny?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** I thought that you said that you have a pretty high AC, Kev.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** It's not funny to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** The highest possible AC I can have is 20.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** I thought that you had a 21.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** You said that you had a 21 last time.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** I had, like, a bonus of something, and I don't anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** Okay.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** It's not funny.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** I was just seeing Kevin's reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** It's funny.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** So, yeah, it hits.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** Go ahead for another 28 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Another claw attack.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** That is another 15 points of damage to you.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** As the claws, once again, from another arm rend into you.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Not playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Deep into hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:20]** I actually have two stamina points left before I start digging into my hit points that are already low because John took out all my damage or hit me with 15 points of damage three episodes ago when he shouldn't have.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Setting up for failure.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Sounds like a lot of complaints.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** You should probably talk to somebody about that.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** You should probably rant about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:30]** And he's out of my reach, so I can't even get an attack of opportunity on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** He is pretty beastly.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** I take back my earlier comment about how I thought this was going to be fun.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** I don't think it's going to be fun.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** It's going to be terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:45]** We got a lot of characters to go through now, so don't you worry your pretty little head here, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Oh, my God.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Start working on your next character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I meant for you.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** Okay, whatever.

**[00:32:52 - 00:33:00]** I believe next it is first it was Colin, then it was Rick, then the troll.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Next.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** I am excited for this.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Frog?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Yeah.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** It's Frog's turn.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Oh, Frog, do it.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** It is Frog's turn.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Frog.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:17]** I know exactly what Frog is going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Frog's going to be like, I can't fight this thing.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** I got to lose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** I got to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** Get my pedicure done.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Oh, that's what this is calling me.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** I've got to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** My nails look ugly right now.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** I can't fight like this.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Nestor Doctor, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Nestor Doctor, okay.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:39]** There's just a huge turn that just falls to the ground.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** It's wrong.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Seize the turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:47 - 00:34:08]** so it's gonna be okay it's cool it's cool frog it's cool okay let me we do a little roll here in the background to make sure that i'm good for what i want to do see where's it at i'm gonna make sure i randomly attack somebody crushed it that's frog there it is okay

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:25]** I think Frog is going to reach down and see, because as Frog stepped onto these grates, the grates kind of crushed a little bit under Frog's weight.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:33]** And in fact, each time the troll steps, you can tell that these grates are, you know, they can hold the weight, but they're straining.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Frog reaches down.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:52]** Or if I just do reaches down, grabs one of the the the grates with its claws and just and you hear the sound of ripping metal as frog picks up a grate and rips it off the floor.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** And I'm going to put.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** The greats actually on the map.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:15]** part of the floor is gone and you can see yeah and he grabs the the uh the great and he just i think he will probably i think frog might take uh like is there any concealment between the ladder and where the troll is

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:37]** you're asking us i don't feel like it's yeah it's just a ladder i think it's just a ladder i think it's fine okay cool so most ladders are pretty pretty uh i'm trying to play by the rules kev i'm trying to be like you when i grow up okay so he's just gonna lean over and just use his uh his debris which is the one that he used against you rick 19 when you first stepped in

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** I remember that.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** The hurled debris and is just going to throw this.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:49]** That was a move action to grab that, rip it up, and it's going to throw it at the troll.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Be careful, Frog.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** You're probably within its reach.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Oh, man.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** Frog rolled a 27 to hit.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:02]** Frog is killing it.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Minimum damage, unfortunately.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** I really won, but that is still six points of damage.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:17]** As you see this grate go calling, I'm sure right in front of you, this massive grate that's like five by five just flies in front of you.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** smacking the troll in the back of its right head.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** In the back of the right head.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:31]** And turns and looks at Frog with this green radiation fire in its eyes as it takes six points of damage.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:44]** And as I put the hit points into my Donjon, shout out to Donjon Initiate Tracker, I will say that Frog just looks at the troll as the troll looks at him.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** And Ronk says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** Come and get it, you mother f***er.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** What?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Come and get it, you mother f***er.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** That's what he said.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Come and get it, you melon farmer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** You melon farmer.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** What?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I'll put that in.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** Come and get it, you melon farmer.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:08]** I'll put that into the episode.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Kears, it's your turn.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** What are you going to do?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** A lot of calamity and stuff going down in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:19]** So we, if we, shutting down the system is not going to help us defeat this guy, right?

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** That was the consensus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** It might, but why do we think that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** It's one fewer catastrophe we have to deal with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** There was something that indicated that.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** What was it?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:35]** John made a weird comment about it being linked or having some kind of influence from the reactor.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Sorry, what was the influence from the reactor?

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** None of your business, John.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** I'm trying to help you out, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** John's comment.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:46]** We haven't even done a life science check on this troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** John, I'm going to do a life science check on the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** That'll be my first thing that I do.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:55]** That's going to be a... Oh, my God.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** I'll assist.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:01]** I'll be like, I don't know what this troll is, but... Okay, so I rolled a 1.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Plus 11 is 12.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** So sorry, I think I critically failed my life science check.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:10]** I don't know if that has any negative effects.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:13]** It's a 12 in total, though, after a critical fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** Yeah, I don't think that you did not get it, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:22]** You recall the next chapter over from your life science studies?


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:44]** wow okay it's not my turn yet right no no unfortunately i think we said that you could do that as a free action right i always forget this i'm so sorry yes yeah okay so what were you saying can i can i help you at all to clarify what what what and remind you of what happened before no i'm probably making it up in my head good question head is great yeah does this reactor provide any buff to this troll

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:47]** Uh, that is a great question.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:53]** I think you would need to do a life science check to find out specifically about the reactor or what might at all.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** I think you would have to succeed at that.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** It's the only way to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Okay.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Well, I failed at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:01]** So, um, sorry.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Yeah.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** I don't think there's, there's no other way around that to, to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** That's fine.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** All right.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** So now here's has to make a choice and his choice is he's going to go invisible.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Oh,

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Which is another... Amazing.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Yeah, that's his spell.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** So he's going to do that.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** And so he's invisible now.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** That is freaking cool.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:26]** He goes... And you just see him disappear with no explanation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** Let's see.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Where's a good invisible?

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** I found it.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** The ninja.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** I put the ninja icon on you to show that you are invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Fantastic.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:40]** Hears will then not invoke attacks of opportunity, I believe, for that reason.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Unless this thing can see invisible, which hopefully it can't.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** And he's going to go down next to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Ah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Sneaky.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** God help us don't have to see invisibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:53]** Do you have to roll any kind of move from moving while concealed?

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Nope.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** Sounds good.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** I think you're fine based on the, I, I, let me look up invisibility maybe, but I think you're good to go.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Cause I don't think you incur an AO, right?

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** I know you don't.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Okay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** So it's a pretty good spell.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Yeah.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** It's a pretty good spell.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** I'm not going to look it up cause I want to keep it going.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** And I trust you.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** So that's good.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** It is.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Trust.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Trust.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Dr.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** O.K.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** 's turn.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** And Bernice, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** What's your move?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:24]** Well, I'll first, you know, as Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:38]** is coming down the ladder, I imagine he's intently, while he's fearful, he was probably studying this troll and trying to get as much of a good look as possible before proceeding further.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** So he's going to roll.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:45]** And if I look at the dice, Cam, I got 17.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** On the die, plus 13.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** On life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** On life science for 30.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** Wait, oh, one thing, and I gotta roll for frog.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** Roll a will save to see if you get over the dread that is in the room.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Okay, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** The dread.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Is that a wisdom save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Yes.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Yeah, Frog did not pass, but I don't think you guys noticed because Frog's a baller.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** So he did take a minus one, but he still hit because he rolled an insane number.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** So for this round, I'm going to put that Frog has the effect.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** Does a 14 do it?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** A 14 does do it.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:22]** You do feel the dread as you coming down.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:35]** And then as soon as the troll teleports, you are like for a second, you're almost overcome with the, the, uh, psychic alarm and the troll you're almost overcome with like trepidation, but then you push through it.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:42]** Uh, so I will not give you the trepidation mark, which I have decided is a wavy thing that frog has.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** And Rick 19 also has, uh,

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:47]** You rolled a 30 on your license check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** So this is a quantum troll.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** And I think you'll get one extra thing.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:01]** So you'll get something to know and then anything else, one extra thing that you want to know.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Or I can pick randomly.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Your call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** I think you should roll randomly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You think I should roll randomly to tell you?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** Do you want to know what Hears was asking about?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Or does that not make real sense?

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Yeah, is that something that's relevant?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Yeah, so I'll tell you that.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:28]** So you do know that based on this troll, it seems like this troll is the subject or the result of a bunch of experiments trying to make really highly mobile, resilient guardians, right?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** Yeah.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:41]** It seems like they have been placing this troll and its limbs in various states of quantum superposition, hoping that trolls would grow from other severed limbs.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:45]** It's a really weird and confusing experiment that they are just actually trying.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** And these trials clearly only partially succeeded as this thing does not seem fully formed.

**[00:42:50 - 00:43:03]** You do know that based on the radiation and the fact that this troll seems to love radiation, Frog mentioned that as soon as the troll got kind of wind of radiation, that's why Frog is partially alive because it left.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:12]** The troll does have fast healing when exposed to radiation, whether from some sort of, you know, like in any way, right?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:19]** While exposed or for one round after a brief exposure, such as attack, if you were to attack with that.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** Now, I will tell you,

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** There is no radiation that you can detect right now.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:30]** Maybe you do a quick check on your device, Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** There's no radiation that's like in this area right now.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:40]** There's a bit more, but it's not even at like a low level where you would have to worry about it in terms of your armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** So what we're saying is that the troll at this moment can't use that ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Correct.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** But it did still heal itself a bit.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** I can tell you about that if you want to use your other thing on that, or I can roll.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Sure.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Tell me about that.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Okay.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:03]** It has something that, if you remember the troll polyps.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:10]** Remember that weird old man with a melting face looking goo creature that you fought a while back?

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:15]** That also had this effect called versatile regeneration.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:22]** And the troll always has this versatile regeneration except under two conditions.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** One is that...

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:39]** If it takes – in the same turn, if it takes more than one energy damage type or in the same round, if it takes three or more energy types in a given round.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:44]** So if somebody shoots off two different weapons, meaning if somebody was like, let me ready an action.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Energy type.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Sorry?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Yes.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Yep.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:56]** Or in just the whole round, if you do three or more different energy types, then for that round, you will get rid of the regeneration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** That's exactly what we encountered with the other troll, wasn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Yeah, that was the troll polyp part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** That's like a troll thing.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Yeah.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Understood.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** So that is what you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** Hey, guys, did you all catch that?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** That I just sort of magically transmitted over the comms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:18]** I can't picture Dr. K talking through it being like, uh, yeah, troll polyps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Remember from before?

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** And yeah.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Love it.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Yep.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** Here's telepathically response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:37]** Yeah, Bernice, make sure you use that transmutation matrix pistol because it's got two types of energy damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Oh, there you go.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** That's smart.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:45]** He doesn't, like, recover all the damage that we would have from an attack.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Five hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Five hit points.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:52]** Five hit points with the fast healing and five hit points with the versatile regeneration.

**[00:45:52 - 00:46:22]** but in this case it would just be five because he doesn't have that fast healing right now radiation yes yes yes wait he healed five points yeah so five points for the fast healing if there's radiation present or is attacked like exposed to it or five points just from the versatile regeneration unless you have those energy types yeah that's every turn man that's like only once at the start of his turn oh okay yep that's really crazy debuffs one attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** I don't even know how to spell versatile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** B-E-R-S-A-T-I-L-E.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Oh, autocorrect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Autocorrect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:36]** So we don't think turning off these computers is going to help us with the troll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:41]** Do you want to try and do a perception check on the computers on what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Okay.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:48]** Because I feel like now that you've figured that out, maybe you're like, let me just look.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Let me just see.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Uh, 18.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** You can tell, Dr. Okay, that you look over and it's about to be the end of round one.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:10]** And when you look over, you see on the workstation that there seems to be a light that is about to flash.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** This red light.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:20]** And you think to yourself, there's something going on with the reactor that

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:27]** I think that that might be some sort of alarm that there could be a radiation spike about to happen.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:33]** And the computer has an alarm to indicate when that's about to happen.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:37]** And you see next to that alarm, you see a red button.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:43]** And you think, if I could press that button, maybe I could prevent that radiation spike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Yeah, I'm going to do that.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Love it.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** So Dr. K is going to be like, I got an idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:54]** There's going to be a radiation spike.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** And then he just runs over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Bernice, cover us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** This is all happening roughly at the same time.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:14]** So I can imagine that as the Great is flying through the air from Frog and as Colin is casting Reflecting Armor, just in your comms, Dr. K is like, It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:37]** hits the button give me a dexterity check just a d20 plus your uh plus your thing it's pretty easy gosh yeah and add two add two to it four plus uh dex dex dex oh no wait you rolled a four on the die oh i'm on dice cam hey guys


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** Yeah, I got a five total.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Plus you said two, right?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Plus two.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** Yeah, so seven on my dex check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** Oh, it's DC 10.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:57]** I can imagine that you're going over and you like trip lip on a grate that's just like a little bit wobbly.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Yes.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Maybe it was like...

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:04]** crushed by the troll previously when he was dismantling these gray bodies at my feet.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:13]** And I just sort of slip and I like accidentally hit the palm rest next to like the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** Yeah, you put a tentacle out and stopped yourself.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** I love it.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** I love it.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:43]** close though okay so it will still go off because you didn't stop it but you're gonna plus two next time because you know what's going on and i will say that as you kind of step forward and as you're like tripping forward you stop yourself from falling you do see that underneath the uh the whole workstation you do see that there are these uh pry bars right that uh there are three of them and you you think to yourself

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** these could help me get up these grates.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** Because these grates require a strength check to get up.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:57]** And if I could use that, then these pry bars would give me a bonus to pull up the grate.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:06]** And then if more than one of you had these pry bars, you could also grant more bonuses to get these grates up in case you wanted to do that.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** I'm just going to tell you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:11]** In case you wanted to look to open something later?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** So...

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:16]** I will say that when Frog pulled up the grate, you saw that there's a crawl space.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:27]** So if you wanted to, you could get down underneath these grates and you could crawl in this interim space beneath the grates and all the pipes that are below.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Hmm.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Might be advantageous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Exactly.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:36]** Strategically, gents, we could maybe... Some of us get underneath the floor.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** But it might also be perilous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** I don't know.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** But maybe the troll wouldn't hit you?

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** Maybe it would?

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** I don't know.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** You know?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** You might be out of sight.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** You would certainly get some sort of bonus, too.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** You can see them.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:52]** So...

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** What else do you want to do on your turn, Dr. Gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:03]** I think that was... Yeah, so... I mean, I would just tell Bernice to cover Rick and everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:09]** Cover us, Bernice, while I investigate this computer console that I can't seem to hit the button on.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** You just missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:27]** Yeah, so I think Bernice would see Rick get, you know, swiped at and react with the rock throwing a grate and then be like firing wildly with the vapor.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** Sorry, not the vapor cavitation, but it's the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** Yeah, the vapor cavitation, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Transmutation pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:36 - 00:52:01]** yeah the transportation matrix oh it is vapor cavitation pistol yeah you've got the knife and the thing right yeah okay yeah i love it so slit opens up vapor cavitation pistol comes out right and you fire on you might need to move uh no i don't think you'll need to move you're right next to frog who is large but i think if you if if you were at the front of your square you'd be fine what do you roll

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** A three.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** For a two.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:11]** The shot goes wildly, hits the wall, leaving a little mark in the wall.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Rough.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Rough.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Yeah, it's rough.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Good round.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Okay, top of round two.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Tough fight so far.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:29]** It's at round two that, Dr. O'K, you miss the palm rest and maybe your eyes widen a little bit as all of you do hear like a...

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:39]** And there is a, like, sense that the whole room is starting to fill with radiation.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:49]** And you see maybe on your device, Doctor, okay, that... And the radiation, the green rods begin to glow furiously.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:55]** As the room floods with a medium level of radiation...

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** Yeah, this is intense.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** I'm just going to say this right now.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:09]** Everyone here, even with your armor, you need to make a DC 17 Fortitude save.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:14]** And those of you who have armor, which is Dr. OK, here's Rick 19, Colin, don't think frog.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:18]** You get a plus four DC 17 Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:24]** I'll be honest, I've read the radiation stuff like four times, and I was still a little confused on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Yeah.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** It basically works like this.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** If you get radiation, because I made a huge chart in my notes for it.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** If you get radiation, right?

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:36]** If you fail this, you are then on the radiation poison track.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:40]** And at each state...

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:47]** of the poison track, you have to essentially avoid getting radiation sickness.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** So if you were to stay in radiation for a while, you could die, right?

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Like that's the poison track.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** But if at any point on that track, if you leave radiation, you'll be fine.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** You won't be on that radiation track.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:03]** But if you contract radiation sickness, then that's a disease, a physical disease that is its own track.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:08]** So radiation is no joke as far as how that all works.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** You raising your hand, Kelly?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** You just stretched.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** No, here's past the check.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** Okay, here's past the check.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** What about Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** I'm rolling right now.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Rolling it right now.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:26]** I got a four on the die, but I have a plus three and a plus two for my mechanic level.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** That's the plus four that he mentioned if you have armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** And then another plus four.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:37]** Plus five is, so that's nine and 14.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** 14?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Yeah.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Do you make it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I think I failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:44 - 00:55:04]** think you failed oh let's come back to that colin what'd you get seven oh oh no we got to get this radiation down that was a that was a two on the rock rick 19 frog frog frog passed you got 20 so it's it's my roll plus you said a plus four for armor plus four for your armor plus your fortitude


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:29]** plus my fortitude save so that's nine plus 14 for a pass nine plus 14 yeah yeah you're good Colin doctor okay okay I'll say this doctor okay you think that this radiation might not overload like it's been increasing in frequency so it will probably go away after a round

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:53]** for now but it might come back but you have a chance to stop it but let's get to the radiation poison so you are dr okay and colin maybe colin you're really close and dr okay even though you are far away you're just focusing maybe you just like as you trip there's just something about it that the vulnerable for a moment i don't yes yeah realize what's going on and yes yeah okay

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** You are weakened.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:02]** The victim takes a minus two penalty to fortitude saves, constitution checks, and constitution-based DCs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** Is that a... It's a minus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:09]** It's a poison, and I'm on the constitution poison track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Probably under conditions?

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** No, it's under poison.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** I think he's talking about putting it on hero lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:21]** Every time the victim attempts a fortitude save against the poison, whether he succeeds or not, he loses hit points as per on an initial exposure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** I think it's treated just like poison afflictions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** I don't see it.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Yeah.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:26]** Yeah.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** It's treated as a poison.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** It just has a constitution poison track.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** But so it's constitution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Yeah.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Is that going to be the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** I think so.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** You should be weakened.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** I think is the first step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:46]** Okay, well, I'll just add constitution poison, a generic constitution poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** Yeah, there's constitution poison under afflictions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** And then we can click it.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:56]** I think you can do... I don't know if it's quantity or value.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Yeah, let's do one.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** I'm not clicking it because I don't have it, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:10]** So I take a minus two penalty to fort saves, constitutions checks, and constitution-based DCs every time I attempt a fort save against a poison, whether it succeeds or fails.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:14]** And then I can become impaired and then debilitated, then unconscious, then dead.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** Right, John?

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Right now, you're weakened.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Right now, I'm weakened.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:24]** I don't feel so hot, Denise.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:29]** Can you CT this computer thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:34]** He overhears that, and now he realizes something's going wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:38]** I think Colin and Dr. K, you both take seven points each.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** seven hit points.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Oh my God.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Yeah.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Because it's, I think it's, it's hit points.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Yeah.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** It's the difference between the DC and 10.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Yeah.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:50]** So which are the, a, a medium radiation level is DC 17.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** So I think that's seven.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** It doesn't hit stamina is what you're saying.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Correct.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Which is weird.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** It just goes right for your hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** That's, that's kind of how radiation works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** So that makes sense.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:08]** Uh, and I do see here the whole radiation sickness at DC 18 fortitude saving throw.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** I think you take that right now.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** The question is, do you take them?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:17]** I think you do take a minus two to that fortitude save to not contract radiation sickness.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:20]** Oh, so you are.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Yeah.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:23]** So I think you now have to make another Colin and Dr. Okay.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** I have to make another saving throw for this.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** You save me through DC 18 and you take a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:34]** So wait, you do that at the top of the round right after we take the radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:42]** I think you... I rolled it, but I rolled it off, and it was a natural 20.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:45]** I mean, what's in the box?

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:54]** It, like, bounced into the box and was up here where it's out of camera, but it was on 20, so I just moved it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** I think that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** No?

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Dice Cam, what do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** It looked clean.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:04]** It was just off camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** I think it's clean too.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:10]** You don't have radiation sickness disease, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:13]** Okay, here's a question.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** So it's on the die.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:18]** Fortitude modifier plus four for armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Ooh, good question.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Does the armor help against radiation sickness?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:30]** I think it wouldn't because now you already have the radiation coming in and I'm wondering if it's the disease.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** That's my sense.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** maybe a rules lawyer.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:38]** I'm going to look at environmental effects, armor protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** What is the question again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:47]** Does the plus four from the armor help you against not just the radiation poison, but also radiation sickness?

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** I do see here...

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:55]** Armor protects you against low levels of radiation and grants a plus four circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:02]** It also says no armor bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that causes you to contract it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Cool.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** Well, Colin's forked.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** Oh, God.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** That's a 14.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** Four off.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Four off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** I mean, I needed to roll a 19 to make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** Yeah, it's like near impossible.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:22]** It's hard to do it.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Cool.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Well,

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** I don't think you need to roll for now.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** Frequency is once per day for radiation sickness.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** It's not contagious.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Jeez.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** You are currently latent.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** You've contracted the disease.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** You have no ill effects yet.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** So I think you're good.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** You might not even know that you have it.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** You might not even realize that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** I feel like Colin would know.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** As a medical professional, he would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:48]** That's true.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** And you're right next.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** It kind of makes sense because you are right next to all the rocks.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** You are literally in a reactor.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** The door is still shut, but you are the closest to those rods.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** Dang, Colin has radiation sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]** You're getting the most radiation just being a technician on a nuclear reactor.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** You're getting more radiation than anyone in the world.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** Right, Kev?

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** No, that's not how it works.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:18]** I got less radiation being the guy that sampled the reactor water than you did just being on the surface of the earth.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Stop showing off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** We know about science, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Yeah.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** We all believe in science, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** So, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** But this reactor's broken, so... Colin swoons a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Got my strength.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Ooh, I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** All right, I'm going to... I'm trying to put cymbals on you guys.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** So, you're cool.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]** Dr. O'K, you were hit by the... You have the radiation poison track, so I'm going to put this on you.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** And, Colin, you have both the sickness and the track.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Rough stuff.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** All right.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** I think we should go a little longer.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** Yeah.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Let's see what happens in round two.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** You know what I'm going to do?

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** I think we need some music because stuff needs to change.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** Things need to happen.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** So I'm going to put in some music.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:09]** Hopefully it will help inspire y'all to get this going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** I feel so pumped up all of a sudden.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** I feel like we can pull this off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Yeah.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** Colin, it is your turn.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Top of round two.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** Fighting off against a two-headed quantum troll.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** Oh, you ugly b****.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** You're not the only one here that can heal.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:36]** So Colin's going to do two things in quick succession.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:45]** One, he's going to use his lifelink ability to transfer four HP of health point damage from Rick19 to himself.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** You're going to steal my health?

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** You're taking his hit points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** I'm taking his hit point damage.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** So you get four.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** I take four off of you.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** Vinny, team player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** The light of Sarenrae shines on us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** So do I add four now?

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:07]** Or you're saying, like, after you cast it, it's everything after that that gets added?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:10]** So, technically, given ability, no time, no casting, no nothing.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** It's just a thing that happens.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:15]** You immediately get four more health hit points.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** But it's not based on how much damage I've taken.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** It's just you're just transferring.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:18]** Correct.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Okay.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Cool.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** So I'm going to add four to my hit points.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Yes.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Not necessarily my stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** No, just your hit points.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Specifically your hit points.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** Sweet.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Dang.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** And Rick has no idea this is happening.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** He's just like, feels a little bit better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Hold on to your pants, buddy.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:46]** Colin is then going to spend a resolve point and use a full round action to use healing channel.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:47]** What does that do?

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Let me tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** Glad you asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** I get to roll four of these baddies.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** They're d8s.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:59]** I hope this heals stamina because now my hit points are full.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** You ready?

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** You're going to love this.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** How many eights?

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** Two.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:05]** Two eights.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** Two eights.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** A seven and a two.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Nice.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:10]** 25.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** What does that do?

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:16]** So that grants you 25 to your hit points.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:18]** So that's for Rick alone?

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]** That's for every friendly character within 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** Just to hit points, or is that also to stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** Which is, survey says, everyone.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** So you spread it around?

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** Ordinarily, that's per.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** 25 per.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** What the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** Yeah.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:33]** That's crazy.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** And it would ordinarily only go to hit points.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:46]** But because I have the doctor option, any healing that I would do to hit points goes to stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Also goes to stamina?

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]** Oh, my God.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:50]** Colin, you're amazing.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:50]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:54]** Okay, well, Frog is now at full health.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:58]** So it's 25 points to everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** We have our healer.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Starting with hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Starting with hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:06]** Any overflow goes into stamina.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:06]** Dang.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:08]** Dude, Vinny, the blue mage, man.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Look at this shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:14]** You're amazing.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:18]** He was like shaking in the corner and now he just stands up a little taller.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** I'm feeling much better.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** What do you say, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** I said it.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** You're not the only one that can heal the ugly bastard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** And then just this bright light.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:30]** Is it like a beam that shoots out to each of the characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Okay, here's how I imagine it.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** It's a light.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** It's blindingly bright to the troll.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:42]** But to the rest of the group, it feels like a warm hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** One of the heads sees the light.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** The other one's looking at Rick.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:49]** And the one that sees the light's like... Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** Love it.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:51]** Colin?

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** I mean, it's a resolve point.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** It better be pretty good.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:55]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** That's amazing.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** How many resolve points do you have left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:58]** Five.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** More than enough?

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** Don't tell him.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** Don't tell him.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** I mean, I don't know.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:04]** What is a resolve point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** Yeah, what is anything?

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:05]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:09]** This troll just attacks you for resolve points now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:09]** Hold on.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** I've got my TI-84 out, so I'm going to go ahead and count some things here.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Let's figure it out.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:18]** I graph your resolve points.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** Amazing.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:19]** Wow.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** So that's your full action.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** Yeah.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:21]** Dang.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Pretty freaking cool.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** That was great.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:30]** Rick19, bolstered by Saren Ray's light and goodness and warmth.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** So what is the reach for this character?

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Ten feet.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** So that's two squares away from itself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Yeah, ten feet.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** It has an attack of opportunity now.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:46]** It is the start of the next round, so it does have an A-O-O.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:52]** So Rick is going to set down his artillery laser.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** He's going to take a guarded step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** Okay.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:58]** Little juke, trying to break some ankles, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:58]** Choo-choo.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** I think it's more like a confidence.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:06]** He just walks up to this thing and on his waist pulls out his battle axe and swings upward.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Dude, you're like Peter Parker.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** It's like a golf swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** You're like Peter Parker in Spider-Man 3.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** Just confident down the street.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** I hope I hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:18]** Against KAC?

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** KAC?

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** Six.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** No, hold on.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:29]** It's a six plus five for an 11 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Nope.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** Misses wildly.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Misses wildly.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** Doesn't even get near it.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:41]** When you step, it seems like you went for the foot, but it just misses.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:41]** Rough.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:43]** No, that's my whole turn.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** Okay.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:44]** All right.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** Guess whose turn it is.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** It's the troll's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** Oh, I figured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:54]** The troll, one head, looks at you, swinging, misses, and smiles.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** His weird tusk rays up.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:02]** You can hear it laughing at you as you miss.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]** And the other head looks at Frog.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** That was the head that saw Frog.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:10]** Turns and looks.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:15]** And then you just see the troll seem to pivot.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:21]** And it is going to teleport right next to Frog.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** And there's no attack of opportunity on that?

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:27]** Not unless you have a... Where is it?

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Where is it?

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** Where is it?

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Not unless you have... Blindsight.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:32]** Blindsight, true seeing, or you can see invisible.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** What about blind sense?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** I don't believe I have any of those.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** Blind sense doesn't cut it because it says blind sense exactly.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** I did check to make sure.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:39]** Yeah.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** I went to your character.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** I was like, does blind sense cut it?

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** I have dark vision.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** I have dark vision.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** Is it dark in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:50]** It's not dark in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:55]** Teleporting doesn't qualify as dark vision.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** Here's the thing.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Here's the thing.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:06]** Frog didn't see where it teleports to.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** The troll's right behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:12]** Frog didn't see where he teleported to.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** Look out behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:16]** Behind you, Frog.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:19]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:25]** I'm going to be pissed.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** You're going to kill off frog.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** Cause you don't want to.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** I want frog.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Frog.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** No.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:36]** You know what?

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:40]** What if this is like, you either die the hero or live long enough.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** I don't want to think about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** He could have died an enemy of us.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:45]** Instead.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** He's going to die for us.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:46]** It's great.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:49]** I want, I want frog to live for us.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** I also want Roger to live.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:52]** Yeah, I like where Hobbs goes.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:55]** But the thing is, if he does live, he might still go crazy and kill us.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]** Anyways, good game, everybody.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Great game.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Great time.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** See you next week.
