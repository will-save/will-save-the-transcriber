**[00:00:00 - 00:00:15]** Previously on Will Save Our adventurers' wills are tested as they stop to smell the grey garden around them encountering the entrancing aroma of modified castorvelian blooms derived from the carnivorous Veracinea.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:30]** In a cloud of intoxication, discover another possible casualty of the Grey's trickery among the beastly bushes, a human by the name of Colin Inbrand, who they quickly rouse from the clutches of the fiendish flora seeking to fixate our crew into a fainting spell.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:36]** With no other way out, they choose to press on and hold their breasts through the gases of the greenhouse.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:43]** But will their newfound friend and hrog be able to hold it together through the perils of this Grey Garden?

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:47]** Or is this greenery going to grind our company into a gruesome end?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:51]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:42 - 00:02:08]** i gotta ask because we talked about it last week and i won't have an answer but some of you will what's your first hacker man experience when you when you logged into the mainframe and traveled along the digital wires and did something cool oh man venny is is uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** Let me go first because I don't have anything really.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:18]** I feel like a super hacker when I get my code, my basic Python code to function the way I expect it to.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** I mean, like, hello world is the extent of my hacker abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Oh, Kevin.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** We're going to have some fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Everyone hack, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** I was really good at LabVIEW, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** Oh, LabVIEW is a hack of a system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** I love it.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** That's my style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** Funny enough, my first Hackerman experience was on the opposite end.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:52]** So I walked into my office at work to a black screen and my mouse moving and someone buying themselves a $1,000 Amazon gift card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:19]** wow you saw this happening that's you sure it wasn't like what ghost happened it was a poltergeist your mouse is moving like the actual somebody had somebody had like it was kevin bacon who really wanted amazon what was that well somebody probably had some like uh what year was this oh this is probably six seven years ago oh okay so what is that 2015 yeah yeah

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:37]** yeah it was it i mean they had compromised my team viewer account and i had it automatically logged in so that i could remote in from home there you go and like my browser remembered all my stuff and it was just a nightmare and then amazon was like oh this is a legitimate purchase because you've bought yeah tons of crap from this machine yeah yeah for sure

**[00:03:37 - 00:04:01]** wait so didn't you had to pony up and like actually paid it oh chase took care of me shout out chase banking our sponsor or not our sponsor very quick and resolving those i'll give them yeah yeah they were like what's up yeah no i sent them the team viewer logs i sent them the amazon stuff they're like yeah this is definitely shady we're we're not gonna do this nice nice kelly will


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** Will has to go last because he's going to take 20 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** I don't know what you're thinking, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Will has a lot of stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** Yeah, Will's currently searching through all of his stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** I mean, we know about mitten fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** We've all heard that one.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** All right, I'll tell mine.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:23]** I'll tell mine, and then Will can make the great crescendo of hacking.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Take it away.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** So, let's see.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I was probably...

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** This was probably when I was like 22 or so.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:37]** I have a younger brother and he has a computer that he would play Roblox on before Roblox is cool.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** So God gave him that and stuff.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:50]** And and I basically just installed some remote access stuff on there and then like started to basically just fuck with them.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:53]** So then, but it was like a campaign that lasted like several weeks.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:01]** So then like he would go on and then at first I would like kind of move the mouse a little bit whenever he'd be moving the mouse and he'd be like, okay, what didn't seem too suspicious.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:06]** And then eventually like I'd bring up like the console and then like make it full screen.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:10]** So it's kind of like in the opening of the matrix where there's someone's just like typing to you.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:31]** he didn't really know how to close that out so it was just like a black screen with like words going like across like that and then i would start to like it gradually just got worse and worse and so i'd start to talk with him i would have this like personality and he was very very superstitious so he believed in ghosts and a bunch of stuff he probably still does and so um kevin's ghost stories but anyway

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:59]** uh so so i would like basically pick riddles that sounded really creepy like i picked one from the hobbit that was like i think it's like a riddle about teeth but uh it's like i don't know 20 white horses on a red hill or something like that but that really freaked him out so i would like i would talk with him and be like i need you to do this or it's not going to turn out well suggestion wow where were you when this happened were you like in the other room giggling or like

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** It was hard not to giggle.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** But basically, very often, maybe like half of the time, I'd be right next to him.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** So then he would be like, dude, what is happening?

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** I'd be like, oh my God, dude, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:16]** Those are the funnest pranks when you're remote accessing somebody in the same room and you just carry out a conversation.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Like, you're crazy.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** What do you mean somebody's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:44]** the way that i did this is that i had an ipod touch so that i would just kind of hold it in my pocket and then kind of like do some things and like walk away come back that kind of thing um it took quite a while and i can't remember how i revealed it to him but eventually i i it was getting really bad like he would like look at the screen and look really worried and i was like all right man it's been too long i gotta tell you

**[00:06:43 - 00:07:13]** I refer to that event that time as the hackening it's beautiful the hackening let it be known but now he's learning to be a programmer and I'm sure he'll get into hacking himself at some point so he's gonna get you back the hackening too the hackening the revenge alright Will where did you land so what was your question again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** What was your first hacking experience?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:23]** Yeah, just one of your... Okay, because I know that it could be one of many for you, let's say what... No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Why would you assume such a thing?

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** When's the first time you hacked a foreign government?

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** We'll just put it that way.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Never happened.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** I don't want to be involved in this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Has never happened.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Oh, okay.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** What about one of your formative hacking experiences?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I mean, formative.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:41]** Formative years, I would say, actually, like...

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:46]** Phone hacking back in the day was the... I was six years old.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:56]** This was the pinnacle and height of my... Because it combines hardware and electrical and software.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** What do you mean phone hacking?

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:01]** It's a very holistic sort of...

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** You know, attack surface.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Right.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:09]** And also sometimes it would be like social engineering if you're like trying to get, you know, free tickets to something or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** Three way calling somebody or something like what?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** What do you mean?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yeah.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** Or like, you know, it's like getting prank calls or not considered hacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:27]** I meant like if you wanted to make a free phone call from like a pay phone to like, I don't know, somebody at like a Ticketmaster or something.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:34]** And you wanted, I don't know, didn't want it to be traced back to you because you're committing wire fraud or...

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:39]** Not saying I did, but, you know, if somebody were to, it would be, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** There's a statute of limitations.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:49]** I was half expecting Will to be like, so one time I was buying Amazon cards off of somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:53]** I would say, I would say actually though, like, um,

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:01]** Red boxing, pay phones at the movie theaters to get tickets or things like that.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Those are always fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:07]** Will knows a lot of old technology for some reason.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** And he's like my age, basically.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** No, you're not.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** I don't know how he does it.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** I feel like you write Cobalt or something in your spare time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** You should go maintain some old systems.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** No.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:25]** I have no idea if Will is 29 or 60.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** He's both.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** It's weird, isn't it?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** Yeah, it's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:35]** Will is the whiz mechanic in the movie who's like, I can get us out of this situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** He's 45 plus or minus 15.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** That's true.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** That's true.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Unsure of his age.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** What is Will?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** I don't remember when I was born.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** I wasn't there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:50]** If we just gave you a vague European accent, I think it would all just add to your cloud of mystery.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** He's a sleeper cell.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** He's a sleeper.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:59]** I will say that one of my favorite characters, especially when the game came out, but 007 Goldeneye with Boris.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** I'm invincible.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** He was the hacker of the show or the movie.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** He was the Russian hacker or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** I spent so long, but Goldeneye was a good movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:14]** He was the nerdy one that wore the Hawaiian t-shirts and the glasses.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** He's the one that saves him in the end.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:21]** He stands up and he hacks into the system and he shuts down Goldeneye and he's like, I'm invincible!

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** And then the nitrogen takes behind him, and freezes him solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Watching that movie as a kid, I thought he was cool.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** I didn't want to be James Bond, I wanted to be the hacker guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** In the game, I would always play him, which was terrible because people could see me coming from a mile away.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** Like, oh, here comes the guy from Hawaii.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:45]** Oh, so many of our fans probably listening right now have no idea what Goldeneye is.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** No need to get Keep Kev.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** They might.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** I'm just saying, you should go.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** It's a great game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:54]** Also, they have N64 emulators that you can use.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:02]** That's another type of hacker man that you can experience from the comfort of your own home and not wreck any governments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:08]** And if you happen to have not an iPhone, you could also install an N64 emulator on your not an iPhone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:26]** yeah another reason to go android just saying just saying just saying we don't need any of that propaganda here that's fine that's fine it's like you could jailbreak your iphone and yeah maybe everything that's fine who knows yeah you know if you need any of those services just give us a call

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** And if you're into jailbreaking phones, that's another great kind of hacking.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** That's right.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** What are you, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** You got nothing?

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:39]** John, when did you install BackOrifice on Beto O'Rourke's personal computer?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** What is any of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** No.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** Beto O'Rourke is a politician from Texas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** Yeah.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I don't know.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Who's Beto O'Rourke?

**[00:11:47 - 00:12:01]** No, the politician Beto O'Rourke used to be part of a hacker crew called Cult of the Dead Cow that developed a piece of remote access tool called Back Orifice, whose logo was basically a ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** Oh, great.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** John was a part of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Fun tidbits.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Yeah, that was me.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Fun fact.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** One time I did steal some Amazon cards.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:13]** I bought a bunch of Amazon cards from someone I knew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** Was the logo John's Fun Tidbits, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Yes.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:23]** One time I hacked a kid who then I told as a ghost to go and take Amazon cards from some guy.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** I can't remember his name.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** Is he your brother?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** His brother is John.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** It's some guy named John called and told me to do this.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:55]** and I was sitting in the same room as Benny I was like hey man sorry I just had to make a call I don't know what happened Will hacked the phone into the entire conversation yeah Will was also there yeah it all came full circle yeah it did you're all getting Amazon cards for Christmas I paid for a phone call with my red box that made it happen yes exactly Will this is good

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:01]** I like how we have this headcanon of how we all met like some years ago and didn't know at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** And then we all parted ways and never saw each other until today.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** Until literally today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Until episode 63.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** How serendipitous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:16]** Well, I do want to say we do have a new member, Vinny.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Yeah, Vinny.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** On the show.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** What's up?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Yeah.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:23]** And, you know, just got to give you a couple shout outs.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** And by that, I mean questions.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Just a quick question for you.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:30]** Just going to put you on the spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:34]** Is this like quick fire, like 10 seconds to respond and then the next one?

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** Or is this like a moment to think about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** It is now.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Let's do it.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Are we interviewing him?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Is that what's going on?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yes.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:45]** I think we have 10 seconds, two rounds, two questions each.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Think of two questions.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:49]** You have, I'm going to say 15 seconds to give you a little bit more time.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Oh my God.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:58]** Could be testy questions if you want to test his knowledge about Starfinder since he's consumed the whole rulebook clearly, as one does, obviously.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:03]** Or just interesting, fun tidbits.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** So I will start.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** And I'm looking at the timer right now.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** And my first question to you is, what is your favorite part of Jacksonville, Florida?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Definitely the beach.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** I love the beach.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** I spend a lot of time at the beach.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** I work remotely on Thursdays.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:25]** So I went to like two different coffee shops, got to work outside in the breeze, drink good coffee, do a bunch of work because people can't bother me because they don't know where I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** And that's 15 seconds.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Kelly, your question.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** Being from Florida, have you ever been on a swamp?

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Have you ever been on a boat in the Everglades or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** I've never been to the Everglades.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** The Everglades terrifies me.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** I don't like the idea of any anacondas that are bigger than I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** Are there anacondas there?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** They're not anacondas, are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Maybe that was a movie.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Kevin, wait for your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Will, your question.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Is cereal soup?

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Soup is hot.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Anything that's a cold soup is a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:03]** Especially if it comes from Russia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Kevin, your question.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** All-time favorite video game character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** That's a really good question.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** I'm going to need more than 15 seconds for this.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:24]** All-time favorite would have to be right now the main protagonist from Bioshock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Oh, good call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Wait, which one though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Here is my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** Is a hot dog a sandwich?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** No.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** I do not believe hot dogs are sandwiches.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:40]** I believe to be a sandwich, the two pieces of bread have to be completely separated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I've had hot dogs where the bun is separated.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** It's usually not a purpose.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Oh, is that?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** That's tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** So what about like a hero sandwich or like a banh mi or something?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** That's a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Never had banh mi.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** 15 seconds.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Hero I think would be the exception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Kelly, your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:20]** uh what's your favorite uh ethnic food man oh dude i'm puerto rican it's all like caribbean foods all day every day i could live on rice and beans and pastones and pet meal and the whole like yep anything caribbean i'm down for all right make us some of that when we see you i want to sell it we'll have a treat will your question is the itinerary um if animals could talk which one would be the rudest

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** Definitely crows.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** I believe that.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** They're very smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** They're crazy smart.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** I actually think they'd be nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** They've got their own society.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:32]** I think octopuses would be like, f*** you too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Yeah, they would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** They're sort of dolphins, I feel like.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** I feel like octopuses just wouldn't talk.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** They'd peace.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** 15 seconds.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** You're done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Kevin, your question.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Last question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Go.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:45 - 00:17:07]** um today would probably be correction universe just opening it up um i'm still gonna stick with earth because it's 2022 um so i would say puerto rico i've never been to puerto rico i've been meaning to go to puerto rico for at least three years now made some plans they've all fallen through and like would just go on a whim yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** You succeeded.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** Are we doing Puerto Rico for our Will Save retreat?

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Will Save Puerto Rico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** That would be rad.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** I'm super into that idea.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** All the way lit.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** All the way.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Welcome to the show, Benny.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** Glad to have you here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Yeah.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** You guys are so welcoming.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** It's nice.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** I have one extra question.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Yeah.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:35]** Which character is the coolest so far that you've met?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** Tell us more about our show.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Don't ask this question.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** I don't want to know the answer.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** That's definitely not a trap.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** JK, JK.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Anyway.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Yeah.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:53]** Probably my favorite character so far is Colin Edenbrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:53 - 00:18:22]** oh wow yeah it's cheating looking forward pretty cool man playing no favorites here yeah he's my favorite so far too he's a handsome gentleman of a man yeah because he's fresh heal people yes because he's fresh can i i haven't yet maybe it's a ruse who knows yeah you say it call out to uh to john's like landing page today is really good i like i don't know why but here's transforms into like a happy face with star eyes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:25]** No, it was when Hears got sucked in.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Yeah, you were days.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** You were pulled in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** And then Colin just shows up out of the razor.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** It's because he was in the bushes.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** I look okay.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** I know the reason.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** Okay, now we've got to describe the whole scene.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** So John always does these landing pages.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** It starts off in the room with a tree and has some berries on it.

**[00:18:43 - 00:19:02]** and then here's pops up it's just his like token and then a giant smiley face of star eyes pops up over it and then it drags over to the tree then it pops and bursts away and then colin appears and then here's wiggles and it's like yay is that a good description yeah i think so yeah i think that's really good

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** Which is pretty much a summary of what happened in the last episode, so go back and listen to it.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** That's accurate.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** I'm sure Will also explained it in his intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** What was that, Will?

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** This is very important.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** I just said previously on Will's save.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Oh, but you said it, and it was such gravity.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** It really pulled me in for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** I thought you were just going to steal that and roll with it, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Yeah, well, I think someone was talking.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Someone by the name of Kevin was talking.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** No, never.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** So I couldn't really roll with it.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** There's no way to edit it in post.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** We don't edit anything at all.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Nope, nothing.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** None of this is going to get edited.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Nope, definitely not.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** Definitely not.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** All right, let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** I got something else to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** Before we do, it better be a rant.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** It better be great.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:49]** I am going to veto your talk, Kev, whatever you have to say.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Because I do have something that I want to read.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Okay.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** I want you guys to close your eyes.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:11]** Sometimes Zanka felt like herself and sometimes she didn't.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:26]** This was one of the few lucid times that her clarity was needed as Zanka felt the guard's presence pushing, imposing all around her, despite her eyes shut tightly.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:40]** As we see the hallway right outside the dining on the Sugesta, everything is in slow motion as we see Zanka hugging her Shirin boy.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** Bodies all around pushing, reaching, trying to pull them apart.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:50]** But the comfort of her son's skin against her cheek is all that matters right now.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** Voices are filling her ears.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** Hands are attempting to separate her body from his.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** But she's strong and she has him nearby.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:07]** She has him safe for now from danger and from them.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:18]** That's only mere moments before she recognizes the familiar voice of her personal security detail calling out for the general guards to stand down.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:22]** Step back from that woman.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** Don't draw your weapon unless you want to lose that whole hand.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** Let's go.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Let's go.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Move it.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Move it.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:49]** Zanka opens up her eyes enough to see the familiar human hands, the same hands that greeted her at Zephrak Station, the same hands that handed her her son, that protect their family, now making way for her to escape this assault.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Are you okay?

**[00:21:52 - 00:22:00]** Says the human woman, her auburn hair swinging as she looks back over her shoulder to ensure that they're not being followed down the corridor by the guards.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:20]** Zanka ignores the question and then just begins guiding her boy as her guard's hand guides her, winding down the opulent hallways, their footsteps moving from a hurried pace on the luxurious floor to a slow, purposeful walk.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:25]** Zanka could see that they were almost back to their private spaces.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:32]** The wayfinding on the floor and the colors were beginning to change to a more residential, calm feel.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:37]** And it was time, she began thinking, for him to join.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:44]** He should know the power that we have, the cognizance, the true purpose.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** She was losing her clarity.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** All three of them rock forward as there's a slight pitch in the ship.

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:01]** The bright colors of the drift glow and then fade to black, indicating that they've left the drift behind.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** unexpectedly.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:08]** Then the lights on the ship went out.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** No, Zanka whispers.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:19]** It feels like an eternity, the true pitch black of space, the absolute emptiness permeating the Sugesta.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:31]** When suddenly, purple emergency lights suddenly track along the floorway and barely reach the viewports, oppressively pushed back by the null darkness outside.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** He is alone.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Zenka is gone.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Security gone.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** His mind races.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** What is happening?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** He was just in his room.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** And then those eyes.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** And then he's in the hallway.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** And then his mother's rushing towards him.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** People are yelling.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** And then he's walking.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** And then now everyone is gone.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** And that thought is punctuated by a bright floodlight.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Pfft.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** that illuminates around the corner, streaming down an adjacent hallway.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:14]** He can't see where it's coming from, but there are shadows moving slowly along the walls, growing larger, almost engulfing the light.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** He gulps.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Where is his mom?

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:26]** He begins to walk forward one timid step closer to the light and the shadows.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** His heart is pounding.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:40]** He peeks around the corner and his mouth falls open as we see six bodies floating in midair, mouths agape, eyes open, just

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** And they're frozen.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:53]** It seems not a finger or limb twitching, floating, arched back several feet above the ground.

**[00:24:53 - 00:25:01]** One of them, Marcus, then his two boys, then another Lashunta woman, a Kasathan, a Patra.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:05]** And he feels a presence twinge in the back of his mind.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** And he whips around to see the other end of the hallway is pitch black.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** The light isn't permeating.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** The wall's barely dimly lit.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** And those same black eyes appear from the darkness.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** And a voice enters his thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** We have all that we need from you, young one.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** But your mother...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:37]** Instantly, there's a tug on the young Sheeran's arm and his mother's voice fills his ears.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Come, come, run!

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:44]** His feet take off instinctively, being led by his mother's hand as he runs down the hallway.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:51]** The glare from the purple lights as he winds his way through the corridors makes it hard to focus.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:55]** because almost every hallway he runs by has more floating bodies.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** His head is on a swivel.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:03]** He keeps trying to count, but he loses track as he's pulled to move faster and faster around each corner.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:11]** The last corner reveals four circular hatches, the track lighting running into the wall and along the circumference of only one of them.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** But the escape pod door opens with a calm whoosh.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:37]** as his mother pushes him guides him into the escape pod and with one foot in he hears the familiar powering down of the ship and he turns back to see the track lighting in the hallway powering down one section of hallway at a time the impending darkness rushing towards him

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** One section at a time.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:53]** His mother's body covers his view finally as she pushes him in, dives in herself, simultaneously kicking the hatch button to shut with her feet and pressing the release button with her arm.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:07]** as both of them are flung backwards as the pod releases before they can strap in, and they experience the full thrust of brand new escape pod engines.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:17]** It's a moment before they can compose themselves, and Zanka manipulates the pod's controls, rotates to look back at the Sugesta.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** Perhaps other pods have made it out.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:38]** But instead, the Sugesta, the newest Viztor Highliner top-of-the-line cruise ship, looks desolate and abandoned in the middle of space other than small flashes of light that peek through starship windows.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:47]** Until, on one end of the ship, a bright light seems to grow and grow until the ship itself appears to disappear.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Vzzz!

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:53]** And a flash of light so large that both Zanka and her son screened their eyes.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** And then we hear the voice.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** Three, two, one.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:20]** And we are back on this station with our party as the door swings open as you all have told Frog to cover his eyes and close his nose.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:27]** And you are opening the door into this garden green room place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** You can't do that to us, man.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** Can he close his nose?

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** You can't just, like, drop this...

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:52]** giant bomb of flashback story whatever you're gonna call it fade away story thing and then be like no then you guys open the door walk through get out of here like can we digest what just happened that was my favorite my favorite john story moment i've ever heard that was the best one of all

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** This is what makes me nervous about it, because we talked about this.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:00]** I'm going to be running a game here shortly for you guys all to listen, fans.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** This is probably the reveal, right?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** Surprise.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Sure it was.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:12]** But it's my first time ever GMing, and this is what worries me, is that I'm never going to live up to John's standards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** You're going to be great, dude.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** You're going to be awesome.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:20]** And I'm sure all of you, when you inevitably all will GM, you will all be fantastic and fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:23]** It's also like optimistic and nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** You will all GM.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** You will all GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:37]** I just don't know if this is a part of the AP and it's written in the books or if John is making all that up and throwing it in.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** How much of it?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** Cause when you do it, nobody else will know a little bit of column B. Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Yeah.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** No, when I do it, it's all out of the book.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Every last bit of it.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Sort of from the book.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** And I'm going to read it real slow because I'm a terrible reader.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** And I'm going to be like, this is the, didn't they?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** That's a great dude.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Yeah, you guys love it.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Anyways, John, amazing.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Yeah, that was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Amazing.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** Will, you asked a really good question.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:08]** I was thinking about, too, is how did you block Frog's nose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:15]** I thought he was using, not the olfactory, but we had to establish he could breathe in some sort of apparatus.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** I just told him to hold his breath.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** Did he have to close his nose also?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:27]** If he's not breathing, there's no air coming in, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:34]** Dr. O'Keefe and you would probably know that, you know, closing his nose is a wise decision.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:45]** If you don't, you know, it could just I would probably have to do some sort of like missed, you know, like a chance die to see if he actually breathes it in.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** So, uh, okay.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** So cover his nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:49]** Yeah.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** You guys don't have cotton swabs to show up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** Yes.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** I can get a little cut.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** A little bit of slime for adhesion.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** So we were really just moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** I feel like nobody wants to talk about what just happened in that flashback thing.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** What is there to say?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:15]** So Zanka is the woman that was talking with, we presume to be Captain Rameem.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:21]** And Marcus, I believe, is the Australian dude that seemed to be all... Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:34]** All absorbed into the... They were involved in a business deal that possibly sounded like giving over a ship to somebody.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Okay.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** And now they're running from the greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Yeah.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** I mean... Do we know they're running from the greys?

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** I would run from greys.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Or some black figure in a dark room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** I'm like... Black eyes.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** Black eyes.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** In the darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Black eyes and darkness.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** How do you even see?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Sounds like a great name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Black eyes from across the room.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** A little reflection in the cold blackness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:04]** Just like a faint hue of matte, like, I don't know.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** What was that movie with?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:11]** The black void and the shiny black reflective void of... Wait, I'm wondering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Your eyes.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** Like, what if...

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:20]** What if these people that this Grey has been capturing are the people that we've been encountering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:24]** We haven't heard that yet.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** I'm not saying it's not possible, but I'm just saying... All these frozen people.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** This stuff might be happening concurrently with what's going on.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:39]** What if they're capturing the next set of people that will be on... What if the Suggesta is the one that's going to be the next Chimera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** It could be.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** There's some giant Grey campaign to...

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:50]** Or what was the name of the ship that they found parts for underneath?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** The Dreamlighter?

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Starlighter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** It could be that.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** So Lozu could have been one of the people frozen?

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:15]** Well, when he does these flashbacks, listen carefully for any clue, like Professor Benjam or... God, I want to know more about Professor Benjam.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** What was the other characters?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** I always forget.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** I have to go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** There was like the... Keith, Grath.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Keith, Grath.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** I was going to say something else.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** It was Grath.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Yeah.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** You're like, yeah, fuck Grath.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** What is that?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** No one gives a shit about Grath.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** I liked him.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** He was kind of spiky.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** I liked Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** He was a douche with Song.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Song and Dr. O.K.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** did not get along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** Song wasn't a fan of my candor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:52]** What do you mean you want me to take out all the salt on the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** I can't cook with any salt.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Just for my food.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Also, I'm not going to cover for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** That's right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** He did ask you to cover.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** All right.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** I'm done pulling us into the past.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** You can let us move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Keep your nose closed.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** So, Harag takes one meaty... I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** I love that Will has that drop.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** Just a little very overt poke.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Yeah.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** Frog takes his meaty, Keshti hand.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** Colin, was there something that you wrapped around his eyes?

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** I'm trying to remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** His hat.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** He covered his face with his hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** That's right.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Here's his hat.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** It's tiny in his hands, but it just covers his eyes.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** You can't see.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** He's holding it with two fingers over his nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Yep.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Here's his hat.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** It's pretty wide, though.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** It's wide-brimmed, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** Well, I think Dr. K put a lot of gauze in his nose, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** Yeah, it should work.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:54]** It should get you through.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Try to hold your breath, though, Frog.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:02]** Just for this quick little jaunt, we're going to go through this garden of lethal things.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Guiding him through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** Just hold down and sneeze.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** You want to sneeze first, and then we can redo it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** No, I'm all right.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** I'm all ruckus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** So who grabs Frog's finger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** I'll take him by one of the fingers.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** I'll need someone else to help, probably.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** He's a big guy.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Gotta guide him.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** He's holding Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Rick is gonna go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** I'll help guide Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** Okay.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** Here's a doctor, okay, taking up the front then.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Is that right?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Okay.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** So I guess we open the door...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Rick will lead the way through.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Okay.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Yeah.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** That's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:52]** Rick, clear it, and then we'll run with Rog when we know the coast is clear.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:58]** So just a question, was these plants, if we're wearing our environmental suits, the plants have no effect on us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Yeah.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:00]** Yeah.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** Also, they can only do it once, right?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Yeah.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Once you save.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:09]** But they can still attack you, though, if you touch them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:15]** No, it seems like the two effects were the airborne poison and the line of sight.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** And if you have environmental protections, you don't need to worry about the poison.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:26]** And because you've already saved against the line of sight and Harag hasn't seen them yet, then you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** So Rick walks in with his axe and just starts hacking them up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** So you not only move.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** You can do that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:40]** No, I'm going to keep my rifle out, my laser, my toy laser.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Question.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:49]** In case we need to retreat back through this area, would we want to destroy all the plants in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** In case we're getting followed or something.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** There's no reason to hurt them.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** They can't hurt us.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Okay.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Yeah, stop murdering everything.

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** No.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** You're right.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:05]** He's just, like, sneaking up behind, like, plants and, like, cutting them across, like, as if he's slitting their throat.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Like, he's f***ing crazy, man.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Yeah, he's, like, super intense.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** He has black paint underneath his eyes.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** He's, like, crawling through the bush, like, popping up, like, all of a sudden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Dr. Casey.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** I'm just worried about my patient here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Yeah, Frog is very susceptible.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:23]** You would know that, again, it's about a day.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** It's about a day's time between having to roll another save.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Vinny, you got something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Vinny?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** Would it be possible for me to harvest some of these plants?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Curious idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** For later use.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** That's a good idea.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Why didn't I think of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** So, give me a...

**[00:37:46 - 00:38:01]** I think you guys, it was probably Dr. K or Colin that probably already succeeded at a life science check to know that these are the blooms of a vracinia, which is a carnivorous plant on Castorville.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** These are not like the vracinia plant is not here.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** So at least it seems.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Just the buds.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:17]** It does seem like the grays, you know, if you're looking at, Will, you can probably speak more to this.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:32]** If you're looking at some of the water lines, some of the way the lighting is, they were probably trying to grow this and harvest it because they, without having to, you know, like deal with the actual crop,

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:57]** carnivorous plants themselves so if you wanted to you you could take these and you would just have to obviously maybe find a way to seal them or prevent them from just you know you open up your bag you're like oh what's in here and you're like oh there's a bloom i'm dazed again right uh if you could seal them then maybe you could bring them somewhere at some point and try and harvest some items out of this with the pheromones or the poison


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** When we finally get a ship, we'll grow them on the outside of the ship.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** And they'll be like our security system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** When we get a ship, I have so many ideas.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** It's going to be so nice.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:14]** I'll sample it and put it in my micro lab and put it in one of those chambers, perhaps.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Yeah.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** I think you're able to kind of cut it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:23]** Could I load it into a dot?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:28]** Perhaps if you get a mortar and pestle.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Don't believe I got one of those.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** Does the doc have one?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** I'm sure we can find some of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:44]** I do like how, like, Colin's talking and Dr. O'Keefe's like, so this is what I do, but I'm happy to walk you through it.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:48]** You know, you're, like, sharing knowledge and, like, Colin's, like, kind of learning.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** It's a neat little thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** I wonder what kind of, like, person Colin is.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:56]** I mean, he sounds like an assassin now, the way that he's talking.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** We'll discover more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** He's got a lot of curiosities.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** I'm excited to learn more about Colin, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** All right, so Rick, so what happens here on roll 20?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** We're looking at the map.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:21]** You guys are standing on the eastern edge of the room that Frog first emerged from, about to enter the doorway that you opened into the green house room garden area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Is Bernice inside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Yes.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Okay, so Bernice walks out before Rick does.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Rick's about to go out.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** So door's open.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** All right, let's go.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:33]** Rick's going to lead the way with Bernice right in front of him.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** All right.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** Can anyone move Frog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** I got it.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Keep your eyes shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** So I guess we would eventually get here, right?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** And then do you have to reveal?

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** I mean, we're doing this quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** Yeah, I assume that you guys are moving pretty quick.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** I will reveal.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** As you walk out, Frog is, you know, kind of sniffling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Don't do it.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Be careful, Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Hey, we're almost there.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** We're almost there.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:10]** It really should only be 30 seconds, but we're just taking our sweet time for the sake of podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** It's called role-playing frogs, so just hang on.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Just play along.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:18]** It's called atmosphere and suspense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Just in case you suppose we could drug him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** This room is larger than I expected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:35]** So as you come out and round the corner, you realize that there's another area with there's another bush here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Guys, don't run ahead.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** I was going to roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:43]** There's another bush here that you recognize immediately has more of these blooms.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:49]** It seems like the bush, as the room opens up and it curves back around, it doglegs.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** There's a brush up at the top that doesn't have any blooms that you can tell.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:58]** Right now, Dr. K is hanging back, Frog and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:04]** I guess Rick will move up ahead of everybody, and then I rolled a 21 for Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Clarifying question.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** Is that to say that the blooms have not grown in yet or that they were previously harvested?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Or it's fully grown.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Or it's grown.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:18]** Or there's something in the bush like a dead body that's going to be a sixth or fourth.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I can't do math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** Everyone avoid the bush.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** I rolled 18 Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** Get Hrog to the doorway.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:37]** Yeah, it does seem like once you get Hrog past where Rick is, Rick, as you're stepping forward, it seems like the air begins to clear the further that you get away from this bush right here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:45]** Hughes takes him by the hand and very, you know, just pulls him, like, quickly.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** And Rick will stay one step ahead of Hughes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Almost there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** Does our perception not show anything?

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** I'm getting there, Kev.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Kev, it's called role-playing, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:59]** I know, but I don't want to keep moving our characters in there and have something pop out behind us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** I know where I want to lead.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:08]** So, Kev, right as you, Rick, right as you step up, you do notice that in this...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:34]** bush oh my god it does seem like there is another body that and it seems like the body is something in that bush if we have someone else like guest starring on the show not guest starring i should say like like vinny's perfect is there someone else john uh it it it does seem like another small body


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** And if you want to look closer, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Does it roll another perception?

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** I want to get Krug inside.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Let's get him out of hell out of here first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** It does seem like where you guys are now...

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:54]** Once you're about 30 feet away from these blooms, there's not really a chance that visually they're going to change.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** It's going to cause you to be dazed or fascinated in any way.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:06]** And once you've gotten over here, outside of this line here, see where the ground around these bushes is white.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** That is indicative of the pollen that would cause you to be poisoned slash paralyzed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** So Hrog can perhaps breathe freely.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Can we roll?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Do we need to roll?

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** No, no.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Do you tell him that?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:31]** Yeah, hey, Hrog, if you come over, come this last bit over here, you can take off the gauze and the blindfold.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** Just don't wander back over that way, okay?

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Stay over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:39]** Does he, like, sneeze projectile the gauze out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Yeah, just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:44]** He just takes back his hat and is sad now.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** He sneezed into the hat.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Oh, great.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Yeah, I'm sorry.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Ew.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Yeah.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** He kind of like shakes it out over the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** I think we are safe now, but I will hold this door.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Check on that body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** Oh, I've done some role-playing before, you know.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Absolutely.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Yeah, I can tell you did good.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** I was on TV, you know.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Colin steps to the bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** Yeah, I'll roll.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Okay.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:09]** Colin and Dr. O'Kane here step up to the bush.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Give me another perception check.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** I rolled a natural 20.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Boom.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** You're certain that this bush is harmless.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** It just seems like for some reason the creature is in the bush.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Is the creature harmful?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** It's a gray.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** It's a gray.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** It's a dead gray.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:31]** The gray has been dismembered, mangled, lying in the bush.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** And...

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:40]** You can tell that there are some items right near the gray, and I'll just tell you.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:47]** This gray was probably in this room doing something with whatever the intended purpose of this greenhouse space is.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:55]** The gray, the corpse has a needler pistol with 18 darts.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:00]** There is one dose of a Blue Winnie's poison.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:08]** There are two Mark I pheromone grenades.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** There's your answer, Colin.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** There you go.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:18]** It does seem like they were using the Racinea blooms to create these pheromone grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** What was the second thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:20]** Sorry.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** It's one dose of Blue Winnie's poison.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:28]** W-H-I-N-N-I-S.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:39]** A pheromone grenade deals no damage, instead dispersing a powerful cocktail of supercharged pheromones and magically modified mind-altering chemicals in the blast radius.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:50]** Each creature in the radius that inhales the pheromones, which bypass active environmental protections from a suit of armor, good to know, attempt a will-save throw.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:56]** creature that fails its save is fascinated for a number of rounds equal to yadda yadda yadda.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** So in this case it would be two rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:07]** Colin, do you want to take the pistol or should I take it or do you have one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** I've got one.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** I've got a needle pistol but I'll take it then.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Some darts might be useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** What does the blue winnie potion do?

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** We can split up these darts.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Yeah, what's the poison do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** The poison is a, I mean, it's like all poison in Starfinder.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** You can put that, there's one dose.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** You can put that doice, that doice.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Doice?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** You can put that doice.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** The doice?

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** Yeah, that doice.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:38]** You can put the doice into your weapon with the injection special property.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** So, Needler, you know, which I'm pretty sure it has.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** And it deals piercing or slashing.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** We know about this from Dr. OK.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:50]** The blue whinnies is the constitution track.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:56]** And its frequency is one round for two rounds.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** Progression track is healthy, weakened, unconscious.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** There's no end state.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** So, essentially, it'll just knock you unconscious.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:08]** And until you save, you need one save to wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** I'm just going to go to page 419 as Arfaz of Nethis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:16]** And it's just a regular needle, needler?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Yeah.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** Dr. O'Kane, can you see what killed that gray?

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Pistol?

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Pistol.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** I'm sorry, what was that?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** Can you see what was the cause of death for that gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** I thought he was dismembered.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:39]** Yeah, there's obviously an explosion from the cortex bomb, but that probably happened afterwards because, I mean, it's missing one of its arms.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:47]** The other arm was holding this vial with this, like, thick blue liquid that is the blue Winnie's poison.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** And so it seems like maybe it was here.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:54]** It has these pheromone grenades on it because that's what they're trying to manufacture.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:01]** Maybe that helps them with subjects, with keeping certain subjects calm.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Same thing with the blue when he's poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** So is it the troll that killed him?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Is there any evidence of what dismembered them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:14]** You would be certain that a large creature like a troll probably did that, yeah.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Yeah, Rick, what he said.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** What did you find over there?

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:24]** I mean, another gray dismembered by that troll rug.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** A troll rug?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:39]** Yeah, there's a... Oh, Cologne, you might not know this, but there's a f***ing troll rug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** I thought we informed you of that when we gave you the rundown of our situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** I remember the craze.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Cologne doesn't have that, does he?

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:53]** I've also been having kind of a sporting memory, so maybe Cologne, you've got that too.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Certainly recently.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** I...

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:03]** Yeah, well, at least there's another dark grey, but no, I'm worried about that troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** So, are these wounds fresh?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** Like, was he dismembered recently, or is this... Probably within the last 24 hours, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** It was probably Harag that did it.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:18]** Can I roll perception on... It looks like there's an area that's not revealed here.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Can I roll perception on that bush?

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:25]** There's like an octagonal... Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:31]** There's like an octagonal room and we're kind of walking around that room and there's a door on that north side into the octagonal room.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** So I'm going to look at that bush on the other side of that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:37]** Here's meanwhile, we'll check out the porthole in the door.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** A 13 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** 13 for perception.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:46]** It is a very dangerous bush.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** Just a plain bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Careful of that bush, you guys.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** I believe it's a fully grown bush.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** Fascinator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** That's a big bush.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** No, that's just a regular old bush.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** It's not as big as the other bush, though.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** Rick, that's a regular old bush.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Ron just goes up and he's like, no, dude, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:09]** He's got his claws pulling through the bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** Kind of closes his eyes for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Yeah.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** And then he transforms into a troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** He's been the wizard the whole time.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Here's, you look through the- Are we ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Yeah, here's looks through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Are we ready to enter this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** Well, here's is looking through a porthole.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** There is a porthole, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Yeah.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** There's a porthole here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Okay.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** What does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** What does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** That's a ladder wall.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** Clearly a ladder wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Could be, hopefully.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Spoilers, Kev.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Spoilers to our fans.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:46]** It is a black stop sign looking at the octagonal shape octagon.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** And everything else around it is lit and we can see what it is.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** It's the greenhouse and then the wall shared with the other room that we've already been in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** We're about to go inside an octagon, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** This room is either a portal or a ladder.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** It's the very first UFC season 100.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** We need a Bruce Buffer drop.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** Is this where Frog did all of his competitions and shit?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Like in this giant octagon?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** It's not even that big, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:17]** No, he did all of them in a gladiator ring on Akiton's Arena Warriors.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:47]** yeah yeah what does here see though here looks in and sees that this room has about the first thing you see is that yes it is an octagon shape it's dark because in the center of the room you can see that there is a small opening about five feet wide but coming out of that opening is just this kind of burst of green light

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:52]** And that light shows that there are four ladders.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:58]** Two of them look like they are ripped a little bit from the hole.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:03]** And it seems like that they drop down.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:12]** You can't quite tell where they go, but there's more of this dark metal that seems like it's some sort of intense shielding.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:16]** And the door itself is made of that intense shielding.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** The ladders seem like they're pretty narrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I'm going to reveal it.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:29]** Okay.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Anytime.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** It's all good.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** So, hey guys, there's four ladders.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** Two of them are kind of f***ed, but like two of them seem to be good.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** They're pretty... I don't know if Rod can go up them or not.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** What's that green light?

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Colin's going to cast Detect Magic.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Smart move, Colin.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** It's normally my line, Colin, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** Does anyone have an ability to detect radiation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** If only we had a nuclear guy with us.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Unfortunately.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Yeah, I think we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Maybe someone who's

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:11]** So we didn't establish, but maybe we need to have specific equipment for radiation, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:20]** Yeah, so here's kind of the thought that I was having about it, was that your custom micro lab picks up radiation.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Is it that you can...

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** totally tell me everything about it, totally analyze it?

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** No.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:33]** You probably need some sort of special equipment to know, to really go in detail, but can you detect it?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** How many rads?

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Yeah.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** Because I think, honestly, that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** Proximity or direction, it's not going to give us that.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:47]** It's just going to give us the presence of radiation, you're saying, in a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:47]** Yeah.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:53]** I think it's going to tell you a bit more about how much there is

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:03]** Yeah, I think because it doesn't make sense to me that your custom microwave can do all that and not do that, you know, can do all the wonderful, awesome things that it can do and can't do that.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:09]** But if you were like, let me analyze it right here standing and get like all the particles and understand everything about it.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Yeah.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Yeah.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Then you would need a specialized radiation device.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** But this, I think, is fine for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Uh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:24]** You can also tell here is that maybe just as you're turning away, you're like, I just thought it was a trick of the green light.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** There does seem to be more of this troll blood.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:38]** You thought maybe it was just the light reflecting off of the walls or the floor, but it seems like there's some blood on some of the ladders and right around the floor there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Oh, no, guys.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** I see.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:46]** I'm pretty sure troll blood on the ladders and on the floor.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** Which means that Frog could probably go up, which is great, but also there's probably a troll.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Frog, how far have you been in here?

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Five.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** You said you've been to the reactor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** No.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** No, I've never been to the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** I thought you fought someone there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** You fought the troll, though, at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Yeah, the troll was in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** The troll ran through the whole place.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Wait, this is where you thought him?

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** Yeah, we've seen a path of destruction through this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Dr. R.K.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** I just didn't know how far back the fight was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** That was a stupid question, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** There's no such thing as stupid questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** I like that Roger's getting comfortable enough to call us out.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** I like Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Rick Cox's artillery laser.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** Yep, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Here we go.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Here comes Rick.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** Always with the murderin'.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:36 - 00:57:00]** every time we'll ask rog's opinion later for sure yeah yeah uh he's over to here's always rick uh rick one of the murder butts we're still trying to figure that out ourselves uh rick's gonna punch the button for the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** And then he's going to step inside.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Rick, as you step inside.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** Oh, Jesus.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** This is a strange.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** No, don't follow me here.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** He's about to.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Sorry.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** Him.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** You're in the room here.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Let's get in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** No, thanks.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Rick.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** As you step in.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:27]** You get just in the back of your mind.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** It's a bit of a sense of.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Of dread.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Oh, my God.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** And that's our game.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** Rick, do you want to give me a physical science check?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:43]** And anybody else who wants to come in, they can give me a physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Can we do it from outside?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Oh, I do have physical science.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** It's very weak.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Oh, I got a natural one on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:51 - 00:58:13]** bernice will come in and uh give a so i got a three okay so dr okay or sorry rick got a three and bernice goes in makes sense that dr okay we'll just have bernice kind of come in explore the room yeah bernice's ability scores you said physical science c okay she doesn't actually have physical science got it

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** Who had the Zeta walking sunglasses from the monitor?

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** I do.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Kelly.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:22]** You were the one who put them on.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Yes.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Okay.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Would you care to elaborate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** Yeah, because those things vanished into the third dimension.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** I don't have them anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** No, but you would put them on.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:34]** Am I going to feel something if I get into this room?

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Perhaps I am.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Isn't it like you have a critical failure?

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** There's like an opening to it or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Let's all talk one at a time.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** Rick, I think it makes sense that as you were looking in, you see this troll blood, but you're like...

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** that sense of dread is just nagging in the back of your mind.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** You're like, I don't, I don't know what's up with that.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** That is, that is annoying.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** That doesn't feel good.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** Bernice, you go in and Bernice doesn't know.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Cause Bernice doesn't have physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:00]** So Bernice is like, yeah, it's a point.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:03]** So if you don't understand physical science, you don't feel what kind of, you don't feel weird.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** If you're not blissfully unaware.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** I didn't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Cause she's a briefcase.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** That's why.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Yeah.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:14]** She has a brief sense of what's happening.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** Punishment?

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** No.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Punishment.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** That was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** We haven't had one in a while.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** I'll take it.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** I'll just barely give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Just barely.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** You are too nice, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** Don't do anything nice for you.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:34]** I mean, here's maybe I just feel like you might need it anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:43]** Here's feels this thing poking at him from the other dimension where he's feeling like, I feel like I'm supposed to go inside for some reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** So do you go in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Uh, I'd be cautious.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** And then, uh... Rick, how is it in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** Yeah.

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:01]** With that, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hit, uh, do you mind, since you're, you're not feeling so hot, I'm gonna hit you with a, uh, a booster for your next saving throw.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Ooh.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** For Kevin?

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** For Rick?

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** For, for Hears.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** For Hears.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Oh, gracias.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** I, I have a sense of, of dread.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** I, I don't know how else to describe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:18]** Okay.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** I don't know what else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:25]** Here's walks inside.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Yeah, all right, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Here's inside.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Oh, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Here's you walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** Here's we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Two things, Sears.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:39]** One is that you look at the blood.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Give me a mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** My specialty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:46]** One of my specialties.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** 20.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** 20.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:56]** You look down at the blood and you're like, there is something weird about this blood.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Baby, you're like, Rick, do you see that?

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Rick's like, do you see that?

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** No.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:04]** It's just blood.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:05]** I don't know.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** And something about the blood is like glitching.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Like it's green and then it's not green and then it's green.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Glitching?

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Blood can't glitch.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** Because you put on the glasses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** Depends on the blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** The blood is in this quantum flux state.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:35]** it's just being amplified by the fact that Dr. Okay, I think as soon as the door opened, maybe you did get a small uptick in radiation.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:44]** Clearly that green light is probably coming from some green light down below in the, in this reactor area or wherever it leads.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** And Rick here is the other thing is that this is what you notice.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:54]** You notice that that sense of dread that Rick's feeling must be

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:23]** must be some sort of warning because in your head it's like like i'm trying to oralize the psychic sense that you get being telepathic as you just experience this vague dread that is some sort of alarm that is meant to sound because it's a gray alarm the reactor core could explode okay and that's our game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** Oh, man.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** We're getting close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** We're so close.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** Hey, it's Kevin.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:36]** I just want to reiterate how elated I am that Vinny joined us.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:40]** Not only is he a great guy, but he's an amazing player.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:43]** But I also just want to point out there's been so much going on in this show.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** We found Colin.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** There's the troll, the reactor.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** I just think we're losing focus on the bigger picture.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** We were kidnapped by Grey's.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:56]** And these flashbacks that John keeps slipping in every now and then.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** What is going on?

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** So just hop on Discord.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Tell us what you think is happening.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Welcome Vinny to the show.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:07]** And let us know about your hacking skills.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Thank you so much for listening.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:13]** Oh, and yeah, just one more thing.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** Pretty soon, I'm going to be taking over the show as the GM.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:19]** We're going to call this little segment Unknown Treasures.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** It's my first time ever GMing.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** Like, I've never even run a test session.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** So wish me luck.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]** I'm a little scared, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I hope you guys really enjoy it.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:39]** Unknown Treasures is going to run right after the end of Book 2, and we're going to drop another episode of Plot Armor, and then we're going to run Unknown Treasures...

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:45]** And right after Unknown Treasures is over, we're going to hop right back into Threefold Conspiracy and try to figure out what's going on with these grids.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** So keep listening in.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Thank you so much for listening.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:53]** And until next We'll Save Wednesday, Kevin, out.
