## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:23]** Previously, on Will Save, our adventurers still astounded by the demise of their charismatic companion manage a narrow defeat over the dromaeosaurs and discover that the only remaining corpse to consider is of their fallen comrade, as another set of green orbs envelop and transport the conquered creatures that nearly cost our crew the whole kit and caboodle.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:40]** With little but their wits remaining at the end of their ropes, our survivors climb their way to level four, earning themselves some new feats, spells, and a shiny new toy for Dr. Okay, who, like a first-time freshman, is now enrolled in multiple classes.

**[00:00:40 - 00:01:03]** With a new bot thanks to his missing friend Boushdakis, the doctor sends in Bernice to investigate the ringing that is definitely not coming from Kev's time in the Navy, but is ringing in Hears' ears as he and our crew attempt to sneak across the threshold under the guard of a dormant Abadar defense droid, who now wakes to notice Hears entering the room.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]** Is this the droid our crew has been looking for?

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:09]** Or has this defense bot found its next set of victims?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:13]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:09]** I've got a question to start off episode 49.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Like I usually do.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** I got a question.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** But... There's no but.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Okay.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** I'm just going to go right into the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Just checking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** I'm just... I decided to have a preamble to the question because why not, right?

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** You know, it's cool.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Here's the question.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Very, very specific.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** And two of you will have good insight into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** It's a computer question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:34]** How long should the electric slide play?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** When it plays.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** Cause I just went to a wedding today and it played just like a little too long.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** You know, like you're like, uh, let's turn it out.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Right.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** And then like you, let's turn it out too many times.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Like it, it went a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:52]** I'm pretty sure the electric slide could play for the full 18 minutes that it's written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:55]** Please tell me it's not actually written for that.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:59]** Well, I mean, obviously, we don't have computers, so we can't look it up.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:10]** But I think the metric for length should be based upon whose ant falls over.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Agreed.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** Who's too tired by the end of the song?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** That's when you stop.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** Too smooth, if you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:28]** I once saw my mom do it for a while at the wedding, and then I determined that I think any period of time is too long now.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Wow, that's fair.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** She had a lot of fun.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** She was good at it, but I was like, why am I watching this?

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** This isn't right.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** It's awkward and weird.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** No, I don't know.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** It's just weird to see your mom going crazy.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Anyway, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** That's all.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** Alright, well, I'm glad that we got to an answer.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:54]** Because the question was, once you get to four hops this time, is that too many times?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** That was my thought, right?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Does it continually go up?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** I don't think I've listened to the song well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** Yeah, because they do one hop.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** That's always kind of one of the common ones.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Then two hops, then three hops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** We're going to get sued just for reading this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** I feel like there are different...

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** Who owns Electric Slide, really?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Everyone.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** This is a really... Shared ownership.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** I don't think it's common license like Happy Birthday is.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** We should look at the songwriters, Electric Slide songwriters.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** We should do it after.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** I think I'm just going to waste maybe five minutes right now.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I'm just going to leave it going while I look it up.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** While we just search frantically online.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Yeah.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** I looked it up and I can't find... I found a four-minute...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** There's 18 counts, apparently.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** 18 counts is how far we'll go?

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** No, wait.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** I don't know.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** Four minutes is too long, apparently.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** Two minutes is too long.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Four hops is, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Okay, so moving on.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Bunny Walker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Bunny Whaler.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Bunny Whaler.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:04]** Bunny Whaler, if you're a listener, thank you for your contribution to the wedding game.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** He actually died this year.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Rest in peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Rest in peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** May your song forever go on at the weddings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** May you do all the hops.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Oh, they're dead.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Sorry.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Thanks for killing the mood, Will.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** Well, you're the one who brought up the electric slide.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** I did.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** That was totally John.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** No, dude, that was you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Yeah.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** I think that was you, man.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Everyone just gaslight Kev.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** Gaslighted him at the murder bot thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:39]** Kev, you always bring up these weird questions at the start of each episode.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Yeah, he's funny.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Kev's a funny guy.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:48]** So, I mean, to be fair, this is the week before episode 50.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** We realize this, right?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** We are at episode 49.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:56]** Once we hit 50, I don't know what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** And I know we haven't talked about it too much, but, like, it's also the new year.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Oh, yes.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:06]** We are no longer in 2021, so everybody needs to relearn how to write 2022 instead of 2021.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Yep.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** So, like, I don't know how many... All twos.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** Well, I guess I type it almost every day, but, yeah, like...

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** I've got to relearn how my fingers have to learn now.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** Instead of going to 21, it's 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** I don't think I ever really learned 2021.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** I've probably been writing 2020 on everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** For a whole year.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** For a whole year.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** For two years.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Happy New Year, everybody.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** Happy New Year.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** Hope your holidays were great.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** All the holidays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Hope you cha-cha'd all through the holidays.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** Thank you, Kelly, for that generous laugh.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Okay, fun story.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** That was just a pity laugh.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:48]** My son has a book called The Dinosaur Dance, and it's like six pages long.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Well, probably more than that.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** It's like four pages long.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** But it's different dinosaurs dancing, and it's by this one writer.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:02]** I can rant about the writer itself, about how apathetic all the drawings are, that they're pretty sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** Don't make fun of somebody else's drawing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** We're not that kind of show.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** It's the same author of another book.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** I think I talked about it before.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** We left that in 2021.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** Maybe it's trying to be approachable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:19]** It was your New Year's resolution not to make fun of other artists.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** It was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** I don't recall this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Kevin's a good artist, actually.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** I'm happy to hear your critical analysis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:47]** yeah great okay well my actual analysis is these children's books written I don't I can look up the author for you but I told you about the the pig singing la la la book where the pigs are singing la la la and then like you you correct them on the next page you're like no you're not supposed to sing la la la you say oink oink and the rest of the animals look upset um

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** the dinosaurs are kind of the same way.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:58]** And, and the book goes like, everybody's doing their own dances and like the Sigasaurus is doing wompity womp and the pterodactyl is doing flappity flap or whatever they are.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:04]** And then there's like the tiny dinosaur, quote unquote, tiny dinosaur is doing the cha-cha.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:09]** And then this one dinosaur that's like watching them all is like the tiny dinosaurs doing the cha-cha.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:15]** And then my favorite thing is at the end of the book, the last page is like the tiny dinosaurs doing the cha-cha.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:19]** Now everybody wants to do the cha-cha and it shows all the dinosaurs doing the cha-cha.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** And I was like, yes, that's the way it should end.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** That is a good book.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Conga line.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Everybody do the cha-cha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Conga line.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Conga line, cha-cha, electric slide.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** That's all fun.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** You just do your dance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** Whatever your dance is, you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:34]** You do it.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** I think we need a dance off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:56]** in this story in this adventure oh no i um my friend kevin brown um his facebook like quote when that was a new thing like his motto or whatever was that like any dance could be the robot for a sophisticated enough robot i just think that's such a valid statement


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** And it fits well because you're a robot.

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** That's right.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Rick is a hell of a dancer.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** That is something a robot would say.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** That's very true.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:16]** It reminds me of Futurama, I think, had it where Bender, he was watching Fry do the robot and he was like, how do you do that?

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** That's really good.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** That's really good.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:25]** All right, we got a couple things we're going to correct.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** And I don't know what the name of this... Oh, rule stuff, huh?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** Yeah, we've had some of these rules.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** I mean, we're thinking about the Starfinder story time, right?

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** But...

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Is there a rule story time?

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** Is there a Starfinder rule story time?

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** What's the name of the segment?

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Because we need a little drop.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** Look, the rules court put out a legal opinion.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:50]** We should all take heed that I broke the rules.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Well, so there's two.

**[00:09:51 - 00:10:01]** There's one, which I'll just say briefly because we might have talked about it last episode, which was just that if you're going to use a healing serum, it is a standard –

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** And I am of the dissenting opinion, but I think overall that is what it will be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:15]** Kevin was right in the moment, but John overruled as the GM, which technically by the rules of the book, the GM can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:22]** Wait, isn't this a thing where all the rules paralegals disagreed with John as well?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Yeah, they all sided with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** Everyone disagreed with me, which is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:38]** Everyone has full agreement of like, no, it's a standard action because it says, I think using a serum is a standard action and nowhere in there does it say it's less than a standard action.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** So it has to be a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Yeah.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** So, which is fine.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:46]** I mean, in the moment, I think we had hands on the chest piece or hands were off the chest piece.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** It was a move action.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** So it's fine.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** But now we know moving forward.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** And that may apply to other things that we use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** No, and that's something to point out.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** I just want to say, like, I do want to play by the rules as much as we can.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Yes, of course.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** I appreciate everything that Paizo did to build this game.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:09]** But also, like, we're human and we're going to mess things up, so... Yeah, we're going to mess things up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:15]** I'd rather have rules and opinions and rules court about things like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:37]** can you do non-lethal damage with magic missile right that is a that is a good naughty niche like like you can really dig in uh but there was something else that came up and i think will you can well i think i i always like to describe like our podcast is not a a rules as written quote-unquote raw podcast because we do try to do that but

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** But I think we're okay with breaking the rules a little bit, if for fun.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** So I like to describe ourselves as a medium-rare podcast.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** That's nice.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** That's nice.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** We like our podcasts like we like our steaks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Yeah.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Medium.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** Perfect.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Yeah, that is perfect.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Which is only medium-rare.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** There's no other acceptable way to cook it.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Will, take it away.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:04]** Yeah, so when we leveled up...

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** I chose to multiclass into mechanic.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:16]** And with that, I have the ability to, you know, engage a drone.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** And I worked in, you know, Dr.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** O.K.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:28]** 's belongings that were formerly his colleague, Yon Boushtakis, was a drone.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:32]** And I said nanites and, you know, because...

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:37]** we had just looked at this tech revolution thing and I like saw the options on a hero lab.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Thanks here lab.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** And, uh,

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** Yeah, it was like, Sage Drone, this sounds cool.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** And it says, like, one of the smallest drones.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** Sage Drone is an ambulatory supercomputer designed to analyze its surroundings and provide real-time advice.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** Like, this is the only description of this drone, right?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:57]** And so my imagination took over, and I was like, oh, sweet.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:08]** Nanites, supercomputer, like, maybe these nanites awaken this supercomputer in this briefcase that is a cloud of, you know, hive intelligence.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** That is a drone...

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:14]** acts like a drone, has, you know... It can do the robot.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yeah, it can do the robot.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** The drone can do the robot.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Cha-cha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** No, and I think... I've looked it up, too.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:28]** The sage description doesn't define what the sage is made of or what it looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** And it also... It just says it's ambulatory, and it says it's tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** And it also doesn't show a picture, so there's nothing to, like, build it off of.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** So...

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Ambulatory means walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** It means it's a walking thing.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Yeah, it walks.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** It has to walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:51]** Yeah, as a rules lawyer, I think what I decided for your drone was that it can be made of nanites as long as it doesn't mechanically affect it.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** Like it doesn't, you know, I don't know.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** I guess one of the arguments is how it squeezes through things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** It was never the intent for it to, yeah.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** See, that's the thing.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:10]** Being able to go, so the Sage drone, the one hard, fast rule about the Sage drone is that it's one to two feet, I think.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Yeah.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Because it's a tiny.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** There is one size smaller, by the way, size diminutive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** Which the word tiny is misleading for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Yeah.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** What is that?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Is there any drones that are diminutive?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I don't think so.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** I think Sage is the smallest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Wait, you've got to define diminutive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Diminutive is half foot.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** To a foot.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** In size.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** In some dimension.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** In either case, Bernice went through a crack in the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Yeah.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** I think that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:48]** Whether it walked or oozed or whatever, it can't, like, compress itself under a doorframe or, like, through a tiny, you know, like, the size of a quarter.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:55]** Like, that was my initial envisioning of it was, like... Creativity is great, but rules are important.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** So...

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** We're just going to play, like, I still have a stage drone.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** Yep.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Her name's Bernice.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Yep.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** She's awesome.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** She is awesome.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:15]** And we'll, once you decide more on, like, a flavor thing, or, like, a description of how, once that really comes together, then you can present it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** I like the idea that you said it was Budakis' briefcase.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:24]** I like the idea that it, like, grew legs, and then, like, the briefcase opens, so it looks like a walking butterfly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** That's awesome.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** That's super neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** It's like the briefcase is flapping.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** That's how I picture it.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** That's how I'm going to continue to picture it, whether you tell me otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** No, it's a walking briefcase.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** That's what we'll do.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** It's a walking briefcase.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:42]** And it sort of glides along the surface on a bed of nanites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** Was that an option on Microsoft Office?

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Instead of the paperclip, you can have a briefcase?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** You can have a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Instead of clippy, it's briefy.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Good.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Should we play?

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Yeah.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** I'm ready.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** I'm so ready.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** I think so.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Let's play real smooth.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** Oh, no.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** Let me read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** The Electrovor.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** No, no.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Don't put that imagery into my head.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** The Electrovor is pure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** You guys, whenever you throw it, it has a slide now.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** It's the Electrovor slide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Slide to the right.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** Slide five feet to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** Oh, wait.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** How do I... Well, I'll look this up later.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I'm trying to figure out how to heal him.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** Or I think he just rests and heals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** I think every 24 hours he goes to full health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I think that is what it is.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Okay.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Let me read a little recap.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** I agree here.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:42]** It's a little shorter, but it's a little more poignant.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:47]** This place keeps taking and taking...

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** and taking from you.

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:00]** First, it's your sense of normalcy, of kindness, and shelter, and security.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:07]** Second, it's taking your expectation that

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:13]** Somewhere, somehow, there is stability.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** Whether it's real or not.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** There has to be a point of rest, an equilibrium.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** And you have not quite found it yet.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** And finally, it's taken a life.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:32]** As Nico Orion lays silenced in the long hallway where he fell.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:43]** Hears, following your telepathic instincts, has discovered a room with a potential breakthrough.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:56]** A gray comms unit that has blinking red, blue, and purple lights indicating that someone is trying to hail this place.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** However, thanks to Dr.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** O.K.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:04]** 's discovery of Dr. Boushdakis' briefcase drone...

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:14]** You are now able to ascertain the looming threat inside of an Abadar Corp gatekeeper robot.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:21]** And as you move to investigate, Sears, you go into the room.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** You walk right up to the robot.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:31]** And looking at roll 20, Rick, you move into a position where you can keep your eyes on it.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** And Dr. K is outside.

**[00:18:35 - 00:19:00]** The visor of the robot illuminates and a vicious red light crawls across and hears right in your face this metallic voice just comes out of the loudspeaker that is right in front of you.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:05]** And you just hear, Submit and you will not die.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** and you need to roll for initiative.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Oh.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** All righty.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** No.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** No.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Here we go.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Yet another battle.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** It's a three for trustee here.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** Yet another battle for you guys over here on roll 20.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** No rest.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** No rest for the wicked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Well, you take a short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** But, yeah, there's no sense of... No mental rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** No mental rest.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:36]** Yeah, one of your party members just died moments ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Clush toy attacked us.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Some, like, rappers came out of portals.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** And now we're, like, fighting the bot.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** Yeah.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:53]** Let us go through the initiative order, as has been done by our forefathers and foremothers...

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** For generations past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** What did you get, Giggly Kelly?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** I got a three.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** Yeah.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Total?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** I have no initiative modifiers.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Just a flat three.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** What?

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** There's no initiative modifier for me.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Oh, it's just initiative plus zero.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** I'm probably not very dexterous.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Yeah, I have no dexterity bonus.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Oh, wow.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:21]** I should have said this maybe to you, but there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Good.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Eleven.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Eleven.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:33]** Also, I like this part of the music because it reminds me of, like, the Duel of the Fates.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** Exactly.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Like, the chorus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Exactly what I was thinking.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** I was just about to say.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** It is like that.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Like, this robot has, like, a double red lightsaber.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Hello there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** And then it smiles with, like, the fangs.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Rick, 19.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** No, it can't smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** I rolled a 13 with a plus four, so 17.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** 17.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** All right, let me...

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** Let me show you guys what this robot looks like.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** I'm going to Shift-Z that shift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** He does look like right out of Star Wars, actually.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** So he has like a BB-8 body.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** It's like a ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** And then on top of it, though, it's like a... Yeah, it's like a torso on top of a BB-8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** He looks like a droid.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** From like KOTOR or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Yeah, that's a good point.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:23]** It reminds me of another Futurama bot.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Right?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:52]** what's the bot uh i'm trying to remember the name of it but it fights bender in a wrestling ring and also in a movie theater i remember that episode yeah you're finally finally hitting things i remember i don't need to watch the show watch that yeah i've seen yeah i haven't seen this though sounds awesome will you always reference it and it's just with really good one of my favorite shows of all time okay uh it's really good smart show yes it's brilliant it is brilliant


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:52 - 00:22:00]** It's got a cylinder head with a visor set of eyes, and then it's got two arms and its torso.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** But for legs, it has just a giant ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** He looks like Robocop-y.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** A giant ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** Yeah, because the head and the way the visor kind of sticks out.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Yeah.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:20]** Yeah, so this loudspeaker projects, even in the hall of doctor, okay, you hear this voice, this metallic voice, submit and you will not die.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** That's very aggressive and like in your face.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** What's the robot from Darkwing Duck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** The torso looks like the masked unit.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** What is the masked unit?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** That reference I don't think we get.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** Masked unit.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Well, yeah.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** It's from Futurama.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** What's the robot's name from Darkwing Duck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Oh, that's a gizmoduck.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** It is kind of like a gizmoduck.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** It's kind of like a gizmoduck, but instead of a wheel, it's a bottom.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Yeah, I can see that.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Except gizmoduck's kind of a buffoon.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** Let's hope that this thing is, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Well, this thing talks like a buffoon, so... I think it hears all of you talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** It's like, your references are amusing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** It does sound like gizmoduck, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** It just sounds a bit like that.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** Does Bernice get an initiative?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** I think so.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** Since we haven't figured out... I haven't read up on droids enough to know that part.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Drones.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Drones, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** Not everyone's a droid like you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Drones.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:15]** Let's crack open... Oh, here's a question that popped up on Twitter.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** I didn't say anything, but I was thinking about it.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** It was like turkeys.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** Somebody posted a gobbler...

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:30]** Holiday-related stuff was like, oh, there's this D&D dangerous turkey.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:36]** But what if... Can a mimic... Mimics can only do inanimate objects.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Can mimics...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Mimic.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Imitate.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Dead animals.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Live things.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Oh, dead animals.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** Yeah, like, can, like, a turkey that's, like, or a chicken that's, like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** A slaughtered chicken.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Yeah, so.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Attacks you from your fridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:54]** Yeah, like, can the dinner, can the turkey on your dinner table, can that thing just come alive and eat you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** I think everything's a mimic.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:15]** thank you for listening shout out to everything another great podcast building your drones initiative so they don't have an initiative bonus according to this to the core rule book right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:42]** they might not and you want to know why because there is a distinction in the core rule book before you get any other drone types there's a combat drone so it might be that in order to act you have to choose a combat drone i think that's why i tried to build a combat drone before but that doesn't make sense for like the artillery drone good point good point it's starfinder-srd.fandom.com which might not be a legit one but i think it is i've done there before they're pretty good

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Yeah, it does seem to be good.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** It did ping something saying your drone does not get a separate initiative role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** Yeah, I don't see where it does get separate in the core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** It might just be that it acts with you on your turn.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** Like it gets its own.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** That's fine.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** I'm looking at the same one.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:06]** Page 75 under limited AI and master control.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** Yeah.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** That's first level.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Yeah.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Well, that's master control.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:18]** Limited AI is each round on your turn after you've acted, your drone can take either a move action or a standard action to attack.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:21]** Your drone doesn't have to make a separate initiative roll.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** Yeah, I think I chose the limit.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Well, it's two abilities, right?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** So you can choose whether or not in each one.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Yeah.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** I think you just get them.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Yeah, I can use Bernice at the end of my turn.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:35]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Nice.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Cool.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Beautiful.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:38]** After you've acted.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Love it.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** Look at us crushing through the rules.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Or in conjunction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** In conjunction, too.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** It says you don't need to spend actions to issue the commands, too.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, and if you also take a swift action, your drone can take a swift action as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** That's cool.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Yeah, there are some pretty sweet things.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** This is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** Or it can combine its action into a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** This is awesome.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** Do we have Bernice on the... No, we don't.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** We need Bernice.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Yeah, she's there.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** She's like a cloud of smoke in the upper left corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Just put a briefcase.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** I keep thinking, do you guys remember The Brave Little Toaster?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** I'm picturing, like, a briefcase from that movie.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Oh, yes.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:23]** That was a... The heated blanket with, like... Yeah, yeah.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** The nose was the dial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** The dial.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** That movie was so feelsy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Oh, it's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:31]** It was great.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** It was very feelsy.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** It was very...

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** All right, Will, I change Bernice to a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Yay!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** All right, very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** It looks like its face because it's got the latches and the handle.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** It looks like eyes.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** It's really wide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** All right, top of round one.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** Let's finally get to this after many important things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** We're just going to take this thing out in one hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:59]** Rick, this is not, yeah, I don't know.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** I'm just going to say I'm worried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** Well, it's not going to be an easy fight because it's just one more fight on top of another fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Yeah, but you guys are level four now, which is awesome.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** So let's see how you flex, Rick19.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** What are you going to do at the top of round one?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** You get to kick it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:19]** So Rick already has his artillery laser out, and he's kind of kneeled down already.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:26]** And as soon as he sees this thing, like the eyes go red, he's going to lay down completely and go prone.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** Oh.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:32]** Just because that gives me an advantage on ranged attacks.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Yeah.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:37]** But other than that, he doesn't lose anything for a ranged attack himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** Yeah, that's a swift action.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Drop prone.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** And then I'm going to open fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:46]** Okay, what is the bonus, again, for prone that you get?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Is prone not a priority?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Click.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** Yeah, you get a bonus for being prone while attacking.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** I think it's plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** You lose.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** You get a minus four on attacks.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** You're lying on the ground.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** You take a minus four penalty for melee attacks.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** You gain a plus four to your armor class against ranged attacks.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** You take a minus four to your armor class against melee.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** So I get a plus four to ranged attacks.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:33]** yeah for ranged attacks for ranged attacks it doesn't show it on my kc because it doesn't the case he doesn't know whether or not it's gonna or hero lab doesn't apply chrome prone oh but it's mostly for flavor unless this thing runs over to me though and it changes everything but it's cool though i love it make sure you attack and make sure you hit

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:38]** Yeah, so I don't lose anything with my laser because I'm doing a range attack.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** So I'm going to just shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** Artillery laser, EAC.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** I'm going to do two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** You're going to do two?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Okay.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** So I get a minus four, but I have a plus eight.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** So it's going to be a plus four to each attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** The first one is a 15 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** You see the laser hit the robot and it like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:23]** you miss that's what i'm trying to say that doesn't hit all right thanks i was trying to give it like some more flavor uh because of what where you did but the point is that it doesn't do any damage like like i think you started off strong i don't know what why you backed out on that you should all right all right you know so it like gleams off the side of its head or something yeah thank you i just didn't want you to think that you're laser and then you'd be like well why didn't the laser do yeah anyway

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** Yeah, I should have burned a hole in the side of it.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Anyway, my second roll.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Yeah, it was.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** My second roll, an 18 plus 4 for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Dang, yeah, that hit.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:40]** So the first one gleams off the dome, just leaving a little scorch, no actual damage, all Flavor Flav.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:46]** But the second one just hits that armor that separates the torso from the big rolling ball.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** How much damage did you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:53]** I get a 1d10 plus 4.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Gosh.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Nice.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** And I rolled, I believe that's a 6.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** So 10 points of damage?

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** 10 points of damage.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Wow.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Very good.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** It's going to be good for you, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:13]** So this is like a shoulder-mounted weapon, and I don't think laying on the floor over the shoulder would do very well on the floor, but it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Yeah, probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Rick's laying down on his belly.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:24]** No, he's got his legs kicked up in the back, and he's like... His feet are together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** He's just chilling.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** He's going to shoot.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** He has so much fun killing things.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Yeah, he loves killing things.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** All right.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:36]** It is this gatekeeper robot's turn.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Little guardian robot.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:49]** As the laser hits the metal plating of the robot, then you see the head swivel and look at you.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:56]** And the voice, the loudspeaker, booms again as the voice says, Your time here is coming to an end.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** And then it...

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:04]** It starts rolling on the ball over towards Rick.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** And that will incur an attacker opportunity from Hears.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** And I wonder if from Bernice.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Also Bernice.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Yeah.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** I feel like it would from Bernice if Bernice can make an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** With a melee weapon.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Yeah.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Question to both.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Do you have a melee weapon?

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** I do.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** You do?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Yeah.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Is it equipped?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Yeah.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** All right.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Equipped is not a word.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** Equipped is not a word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** It's equipped.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** Here's just see it like go right in front of me.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Right in front of me.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Yeah.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Oh, okay.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** Like right.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** Yeah.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** It's like Rick.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Yeah, it just starts to roll real quick.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** What a relief.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** All right, so would Bernice or Heroes go in this case?

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** First, I should say.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Both of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Rock, paper, scissors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** Bernice has like a higher... Yeah, who got first?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** I guess, Dr. K, you got first in your initiative order.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** So let's say Bernice goes first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Yes.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Yeah.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Would I...

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:02]** Envision was giving her the survival knife slash cavitation pistol.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Wait, the meta?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** No, what is it called?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** The Matrix?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Oh, the Transmutation Matrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Yes.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:11]** That's rad.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Is this a briefcase with a knife?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:17]** Yeah, let's see if we can find out the stage drone.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** It's a briefcase with a knife.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** I knew at some point we'd get silly.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** That could also turn into a cavitation pistol.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** So my...

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:43]** this is too good like right now it is a cavitation pistol though is the problem okay but i think i have to spend 10 minutes to like switch it back and forth yes it takes time to switch yeah so probably we should have said i did that during the rest though if we wreck sure that's fine

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** I'll go with survival knife.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Okay.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** So you're going to make an attack with a survival knife.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** Let me just make sure.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** Base attack bonus.

**[00:32:52 - 00:33:01]** And I want to do it with stealth, too, because my sage drone has a stealth modifier.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:02]** I don't know.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** There is a thing in Starfinder.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Let's talk about it real quick.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Maybe not.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:13]** Yeah, just stealth is not as beneficial in the same way.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** The mechanics of what you get... I feel like I looked this up once.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** If you're hidden and attack, I think it depends on the senses of the creature you're attacking.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** I mean, it's just like a briefcase in a room attacking you.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Like...

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** I feel like, whatever.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:41]** In D&D, you get a bonus for doing a stealth role if you're certain classes, but you're saying here it would just prevent you from being targeted by this thing because it's just a briefcase in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Yeah, so you might just not be hit.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** I don't know what mechanically you would get if you were to be, quote-unquote, unseen.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** I don't think there's an advantage.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:55]** I mostly wanted to, if there's a reflex or a condition of this robot that allows it to, like,

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:23]** you know i don't know can i do a skill check though just any skill check like a computer's check as bernice sure as an aoo uh i would say just do your oh uh i feel like an aoo is an aoo it's not it's not your turn it's your attack got it yeah that's my coming with a knife cool attack with the knife the briefcase with a knife the briefcase yeah

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:47]** at the rolling ball as it begins to roll forward let's see if it hits 19 on the die that hits just wait what's the base attack bonus oh so it's actually uh i get a i have 18 to hit actually because i get a minus one on melee plus three on range though okay so 18 yeah

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:53]** The knife comes out, and just as it's about to hit, it begins to roll forward.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You almost hit.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** What did you roll?

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** An 18.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** I rolled a natural 19.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** But it's an 18.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** It almost hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** We have to start rolling high in order to hit anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** Here's your attack opportunity as a briefcase with a knife.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** Just did an AOL against next to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** So I only rolled a five, which is really bad.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** So yeah, with that modification.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** What is your weapon that you have out?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** I have two tactical hand axes.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** So they're dual wielded.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Okay.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Nice.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** It would be great to attack with them.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** They'd be awesome.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:37]** But I basically rolled a two plus a three for my melee attack modifier.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** So I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Yeah.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** I think it makes sense that you really haven't used your melee weapons at all, right?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:49]** So you swing and you're like, I'm not used to using this reflex to swing.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** And it swings wildly.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** Still pretty rad.

**[00:35:54 - 00:36:17]** but both miss bernice so close the suitcase with a knife so close i love bernice just so comical it's great it's awesome uh that's great yeah but unfortunately it is time for the robot to do what it was planning on doing and that is attack prone rick 19 and you have a what to melee attacks because it's gonna attack you with a melee attack i got a minus four to melee

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** To your AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Yeah.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** Okay.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** I'm going to roll with the purple.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** Not the glassy purple, but the gem purple.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:34]** I shouldn't have said anything and just been like, oh, he lays down quietly and then shot you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** He puts his legs down.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** That was a crack.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Die.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** You missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** That hits me even if I was standing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:53]** 12 points of damage as the ball rolls into your shoulder and it slams down with one of its fists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** This is even after I stole Nico's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Well, you're also prone.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** That's why.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** It's a lot.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:04]** And it's lethal damage, which you feel it be lethal.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:08]** And I think if you wanted to, maybe all of you see it.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:13]** So on somebody's next turn, you can give me maybe a wisdom check about that.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Because you're like, this is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** Wait, it's supposed to be a non-lethal robot and it's doing lethal damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Yeah, I'll just tell you.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** Because I think I told you last time you had seen it, it had been modified, right?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Of course.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** And so it is modified to do lethal damage.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** And usually these models are non-lethal damage.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** That was its turn, Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** what are you going to do and Bernice?

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Well, I'm going to directly control Bernice.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Okay.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** And you go and then, and then Bernice goes, right?

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Yeah.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:49]** Well, I basically, I'm like using, you know, the metaverse or whatever, uh,

**[00:37:49 - 00:38:19]** version 5000 in starfinder where my goggles go on and i like enter into a you know full fully immersive interface oh my god you're doing vr mode while we're in the middle of with a briefcase with a knife do you have to so you have to spend your actions to control bernice i believe uh let me hold on i don't think so

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Yeah, I don't think you do.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** I think you can act independently.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Right, right, right, right.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** But you still have the BR, which is awesome.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** As a move action, you can directly control your drone.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** This allows the drone to take both a move action and any standard action in its turn.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** One from your control and one from its limited AI.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:48]** If you also take a swift action, your drone can take a swift action as well, or it can combine its actions into a full action.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:58]** Your drone must be able to see or hear you or be within range of your custom rig, which is my custom micro lab, of course, for you to directly control your drone.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Okay.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** Okay, so as a move action, Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:06]** puts on his goggles and then can give two actions to Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Dang, I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** It's awesome.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** This is why Starfinder is super duper dope.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:16]** And you should play it if you're not ready.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:36]** okey-doke uh so i'm going to move bernice and say you know i'm just like i'm speaking through my interface into bernice and it sounds differently is what i imagine yeah because it's like a protocol not a protocol unit obviously protocol droids like but you know just flavor

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** It's a great question.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:42]** When Bernice talks, does the briefcase open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Does it flap a little bit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:50]** Or is it just the handle that flaps up and down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** Maybe yelling would...

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** It's like a mustache.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** The handle's like a mustache?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Okay, I see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** All right, I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Amazing.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Like me.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Your handle's a mustache.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Like my mustache.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Or your mustache is a handle.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** So Bernice wants to do a... That's a visual gag.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Anyway.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:18]** To disable the custom module on the...

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** On the robot for her turn.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** The droid.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:31]** The custom modification, so I guess it's like, you said it was modified, right?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:38]** Can Bernice sneak up and access it and try to override it?

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I think it's really cool.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Why not?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** Why don't... Disable or manipulate module.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:52]** Yeah, let me grab my handy-dandy computer flowchart to get what a DC would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** I just want to take this time to say that going prone was a stupid idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** You know, it wasn't your finest moment.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** You need like a shield.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Let me walk through.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:05]** Thank you, previous me, for setting this up.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** because it's pretty easy.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Yeah.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** Disable root access.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** I have to get root access.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Ooh.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Yeah.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** So I would have to do it on another turn.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** Yeah.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** That's what I'm thinking is we'd have to break this up.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Do a couple turns.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:29]** So Bernice, first, this USB port comes out and connects in.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:43]** I imagine an RFID or some sort of sticker-looking object that just spits out of Bernice, and it's just like a communications port.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Nice.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** For the controller of the module I'm trying to disable.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Yeah.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** To gain root access.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Yeah.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** I love it.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** So rolling for that, I guess.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** That's awesome.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** I would think it would be secured.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Well, you tell me.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** It's modified.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** What?

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** If it's modified, you said it was modified by whom?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:08]** You would think probably whoever is here, right?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Is it janky looking?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** No, it seems like it's pretty...

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** The actual physical part is not modified.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** The programming is modified.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Right.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** So you would have to go in.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** And what I'm thinking is, is the access to the robot secure or not?

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** That's what I'm trying to figure out.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Yeah.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** Yeah.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** Is it unsecured or secure?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** Well, you tell me if you were to design a robot, would it be secured?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:40]** I feel like it would be secure, but I could also see where like the intent is not to like, if you want to go in and be in the robot, you can be in the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** It's not like a computer where you have to like log in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** I don't know.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:46]** I think, Kelly and Will, you would know more just from a programming perspective.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** I mean, you can, like, secure them.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:54]** But is... So this bot originally is, like, just a safety droid.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** Like, a practice droid, right?

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** It's more of a... Non-lethal.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Yeah, you'll have to do a life science...

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** to figure out more or like a physical science to figure out more about it.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:13]** But you do know, which I think you did last time somewhat, you do know enough to know that this is typically non-lethal and not lethal.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** I'm trying to look through to see what that is.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** But its function is to like subdue?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:25]** Yeah, I think it would be, but it's made by Abadar Corp and it's pretty legit.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** I would say it's secure.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** That's what I would think too.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:30]** Which is a little bit tougher for me to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** Well, it's kind of similar to the hug bod, right?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** Because that was... Same idea?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** Like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Yeah.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Yeah, Nico went into that.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:44]** DC is 20 higher is what it says for gain root access in many cases.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:57]** It's impossible to gain root access and every task beyond the computer's basic functions must be attempted as a separate check and destroy, repair, disable, or manipulate modules or countermeasures.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** If a firewall has been set to have

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:29]** uh i don't think you would do a firewall though yeah i don't think this is i think there's access a robot's design is going to be as minimal as possible it's going to be one layer yep it's not going to be multiple multi-factor it's not going to know it might know scope if it's got like permissions and roles like in subroutines but it's not gonna it's not gonna have like a giant like it's gonna have a key lock and a

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yep.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** I think you are spot on with that.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:39]** As far as a tier, a tier one computer is something as simple as a common data pad, data lock, or lighting controller.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:48]** A tier 10 represents the systems managing the engine core of a space station or the mainframe of an Aspis consortium inter-system office.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** It's definitely not tier 10.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** It's definitely not tier one.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** I feel like it's a robot.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** Probably tier two, tier three tops.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** I think tier two, tier three tops.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:02]** I'm going to go with tier two because I think that fits more with this like common thing.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:08]** That's going to be a DC 21 computers check to access the secure thing from Bernice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:19]** Bernice, however, has this really cool thing where she basically contains an extensive database of information as well as powerful processing unit for analysis.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:37]** Okay, once every 10 minutes when Bernice does a skill check, she can also identify, like, she can do identify creature, recall knowledge, and it can roll one D6 to add the result to the roll as an insight bonus.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:57]** that's neat okay so what you're saying is because i'm using doctor okay yep right yep uh it and oh i have i have this really cool like analysis routine so i'm rolling my regular computers modifier which is a plus 11

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So you're Dr.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** O.K., you're using Dr.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** O.K.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** 's computers, but you're going to add a D6.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:14]** But I'm adding Bernice's recall knowledge bonus, which I'm going to... I think I have to roll recall knowledge on Bernice.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** So Bernice needs to analyze how this thing's been modified.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Yeah.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** And if I'm successful at that, which her computers, I would assume I would just use her computers check, right?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** That's the first time I'm using Bernice.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Yeah, that's what I would think.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** You would use her computers check.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:36]** So this is your move action and she moved up to it.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** So that's her move action.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** So this is her standard action, right?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** In order to access it using her computers check.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:48]** And you're going to roll to identify creature, right?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** Yeah.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** Using the internal database special ability.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** I would say roll and... Okay.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** And you have to roll with the bonus?

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** It could either be identifying a creature or recalling knowledge.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** I think it's up to you.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** If you're going to identify, you would need to roll an engineering check because it's a robot.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** Okay.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** And I think if it's recalling knowledge... It's Bernice's.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Okay.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Maybe it's physical science.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:13]** Whichever one you want.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Okay, I'll just roll...

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** I'll roll the identifying engineering with Bernice's plus four.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** 17 on the die, 21.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** 21.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Shoot.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** You get it.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** You get it.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** You know exactly what's going to go on with this.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** So I can roll a D6 on my computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yes.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** So Bernice is probably calculating.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:45]** You're seeing for the first time the UI in this headset of the library.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** It's pulling down.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** You see Gatekeeper Robot.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** It like hones in on that.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:54]** It has like the programmer's signature who modified it.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Yeah, there's like a couple Easter eggs as you're going through.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** You're like, I see what they did.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** You know, it's like, oh, that's cool.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** Okay, so this is to access the computer.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** So, again, Bernice is going to go up.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:13]** You're using your move action to have Bernice make a move action and a standard action to get into the – to hack the robot.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** First layer is to get past the security.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** What will?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Gain root access.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** So what is your roll to get in?

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** It's DC 21.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** I hit 19 on the die.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** I haven't even rolled any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** So now you add the computer bonus and the D6, right?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** Yeah, and I rolled a 6 on my... I just rolled a 6.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** You rolled a 6.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** That's at least 25.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:46]** You are able to get past the security into the gatekeeper robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:57]** I just love from Rick and here's his perspective, this briefcase just kind of waddles over to this giant guard robot and just leads forward and plugs into it.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** It's awesome.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:58]** Game over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:02]** It's so great.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** It's so good.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:08]** That is, I think that's, Bernice, the standard action, right?

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Yeah.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** Yeah.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** That's it.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** That's awesome.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:15]** This is, this is just the coolest session.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Dr. Okay, it is now your turn.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** You're wearing VR goggles.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** What do you do with your standard action?

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Can I manipulate?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** I think technically, by the way, Bernice should go after you, but it's fine in that you were using your move actions.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** That was part of it.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** It's fine.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** If you're going to do the magic control, it's fine.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** I think.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** If you disagree, then get angry at me on Twitter.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** No.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** No, no, not you, listeners.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** So Dr. O'Keefe can't fire on it, right?

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Because you're wearing the goggles?

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** I thought that was more flavor.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:52]** No, that is flavor, but I mean like... It says it has a move action, so you can still take it to standard.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** Your standard could be to attack.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Is the door open?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** I think the door's been open this whole time.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** I don't remember you guys closing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:08]** So I'm going to... I think we need to start drawing on green and red lines to see whether or not doors open or shut.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Okay.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** All right, Kev.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** I'll take your not-so-subtle suggestion there.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** Jeez.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:24]** I'm really, I think I would only do like a, uh, I actually don't think a doctor.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** Okay.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:28]** Would attack because it's like, he just got access, right?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Like through Bernice, he was there.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** He experienced that.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** So, um,

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:41]** I think what he'll do is just hit Rick with a booster.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Just punch him.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** You're going to shoot Rick?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Yeah.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Just lead to the door.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Yeah.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Did you?

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, because you do kind of have cover.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:58]** Well, for ranged attacks, I have my normal KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** Yeah, but you get a plus four because you're prone to ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Oh, I get a plus four.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Yeah, you can't hit me, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** I'm prone.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:08]** Yeah, dude, because he's down with cover in the corner on the ground.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** I think it's just hard to shoot him.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Again, going prone was the stupidest thing I've ever done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** I think it was the best thing you could have done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** And I've done some stupid things in my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** This takes the cake.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Yeah.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** All right.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:27]** I'm trying to remember what is the booster that I can give you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Nothing.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** You can't even hit me, man.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Even if you tried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Rude.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** That's not what a supportive cast member says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** I'm just saying I have a 24 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** No, no, no.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** It's totally worth a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** You should do whatever you want, Dr. K. Unless you're the GM and you get a plus 14 to every attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** I'm going to give you a plus 4 to your next saving throw with a minor booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** But you have to hit me and you have to do an attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** I'm attuned to you.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** I don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Oh, perfect.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** Because the micro lab, I don't have to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Never mind.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Disregard everything.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Oh, yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** That's right.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** The dart will find its way to you.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** If you shoot it, it will land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** He's got the VR goggles on, which are practically a blindfold.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** He just points his gun straight in the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** I feel like they're like the AirPods where you can have the transparency mode.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** So you turn off the visual cancellation and you can suddenly see everything.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** What's its attack right now?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** What?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** What do you mean?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** How is it hurting Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Kinetically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Melee?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** It's slamming Rick.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** So would Rick bleed from that?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:36]** I don't think so.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** It's bludgeoning damage.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** Yeah.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Bludgeoning.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** I don't think this actually helps.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:48]** So I'm just going to give you the basic booster, which will give you a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:54]** Rick, do you need some armor or do you want some insight?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** I don't think he can answer you, though.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** That's the problem because of the initiative order.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Say again, Kelly?

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** I don't know.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** Can you even answer him because we're in initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Yeah, I feel like we're in initiative order.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** It's a free action.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** I mean, technically speaking, it's a free action.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** You could probably just give one answer.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** One word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Armor is never a bad choice.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** Too many words.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Armor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Armor!

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Yeah, because you're being crushed by this robot.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:23]** Armor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:27]** So I hit him with a... Yeah.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** You get a plus one to your AC.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Amazing.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Plus one to my AC.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** That's awesome.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** That is very useful.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** For the next four rounds.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:40]** I feel like you just put through your... You don't even look.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:46]** You just push your... You also gain a plus four bonus on your next saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** That's awesome as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** This is under the minor booster.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:54]** I feel like you just put your injector pistol through the door and fire, knowing it will hit.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** You just point in general direction.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** No, wait.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** I can only do the AC or the saving throw.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Okay.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Or the saving throw.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Okay.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** So you do the AC.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:08]** So next round, I'll hit you with a saving throw.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** All right.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** So you get a plus one to your AC.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Awesome.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Great.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** Rules heavy.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Complicated round.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Turn.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** That was cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Stay in the fight.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Dr. OK, the cheerleader.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** What would you like to do?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** Here's is going to go up.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** It's going to saunter right over to this little saunter.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:41]** Yeah, it comes up and he's going to do his new spell, which is inject nanobots.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:51]** Now, I've already rolled, and this is a 48 damage, and I got 21, which is kind of mid-range for that roll.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Now, here's what you've got to do.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** You will take damage regardless, but he can do a 42.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Don't tell me what I'll do.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Well, okay, fine.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** You're going to overrule with your... I can't overrule this.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** I'm not going to take the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** I'm just not going to take the damage.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Thanks, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** I'm not going to do it.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Sorry.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:16]** All right, so you need to roll a fortitude save, and if you pass that, you can take half damage.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** It's a DC 17 that you gotta beat.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** So, describe to me what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** Are you trying to kill this thing, though?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Because if you are... Why?

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** If you aren't, you have to take a minus four to make it not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:30]** I'm not... I wasn't aware that we're trying to keep it alive, personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** Describe to me what happens as you cast the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:46]** Well, what's actually happening with this spell is that there's particles and here's this blood, this insect blood, and they turn into biological nanobots, and then he just uses his magic to inject it

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** through his fingers into this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** That's a fascinating skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** I thought Dr. O.K.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** would like that.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** So you reach out your shearing hand.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Do you, like, make a cut on your fingers so they can come out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** What do you do?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Yeah, that's a really good question.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Here's his mandibles.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** He kind of pokes one into it and, like, fishes around.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:13]** And, like, you know, draws a little bit of blood and then just kind of, like, puts it into an opening somewhere in this robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Oh, so you have to touch the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** I do.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** That's why he was up next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** Oh, but there's no AC to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** There's no roll to touch it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** He rolled.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** No, it's just an attack.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** I wasn't aware that you had to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Oh, I thought you said you did roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Or I rolled a damage roll.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** It hits regardless, this spell.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** But you can roll for half damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:42]** The one thing is that you're going to take an attack of opportunity for casting a spell next to it, unless you cast a spell afterward.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** And you're okay with that?


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** Okay.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** So you reach out your shearing hand.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** You touch it.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** Little nanobots start to come out.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** The head just rotates.

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:02]** The body is still focused on Rick, slamming on Rick, but the head just rotates and looks at you, and the red light scans you.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Can you make this not terrifying?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** Oh, it says make a melee attack against targets.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** Oh, really?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** What?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Make a melee attack against targets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Well, we'll make a melee attack next episode.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** Kev, stop looking at the wrong third-party site.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** I mean, I am looking at Star Jammers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** We know Star Jammer is not canon.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Come on, Kev.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Get out of here.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** Here's this cool thing to end the episode.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I'm looking at rules.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Here's this awesome thing.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Are we bantering?

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Who's doing the outro this week?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Do you want to just keep it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** Who's doing it?

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Ask.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** It says right there in the core rulebook.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Make a melee attack roll.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Target TAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** What do we say in the outros?

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Thanks for listening.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Yeah, wait, wait.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:51]** So next week, next episode, you will make an attack roll.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Right?

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** This is our outro now.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** This is the outro?

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** Thank you for listening.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Thanks, everyone, for listening to our cool banter outro.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** We've got to correct our rules because nobody pays attention.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:05]** Like and subscribe, and we'll figure out the attack roll next week.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** Thanks to all the sponsors and friends mentioned.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** Thank you.
