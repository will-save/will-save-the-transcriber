## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:09]** Last time on We'll Save, our adventures struggle with yet another creature, and this creature had a frightening ability.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:19]** This feral ooze was resistant against all types of attacks, same from those that could pierce or slash.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:21]** This knowledge was all thanks to Dr.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:22]** O.K.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:25]** 's expertise in mid-combat discovery.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:30]** And with some team effort, and in overheated years, the ooze finally went down.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:34]** However, fear was lurking just behind the next door.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:42]** As Rick-19 steps inside to confront a terrified Belita, he is overwhelmed by a sense of terror.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** Where is this terror coming from?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save!

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Because it just is.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** I have two questions for you.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** What haven't we done in an opening banter in a long time?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** That's the first question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Wait, wait, so, sorry.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** We have done it before.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** We just haven't done it in a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Yes.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** Quack Pack, but Quack Pack is awful and it can burn in hell.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:24]** Oh, Dragon Ball Z. Yeah, Dragon Ball Z. All-time favorite.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** Hey, Arnold.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** The theme, it's awesome.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** The Frosted... It's both funny and touching and sad.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** It's brilliant.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** The Frosted Flakes commercials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:40 - 00:03:01]** hey tony i like the things you do oh that's right it's about like 90s commercials like capri sun yeah you had a very strong reaction when we said childhood cartoons so i'm curious what your what your answer is this is not the answer that i have in my head we'll get to that what are you asking me what's your favorite childhood cartoon

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** That's the actual question.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** No, that's not the question that I was thinking.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** But I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:12]** I probably watched DuckTales over and over and over and over.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:19]** Also, I think it was Rescue...

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Rescue Rangers?

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Oh, yeah, Rescue Rangers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** No, no, no.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** All right, Will, I'm so on board with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** This is why I knew I liked Will the moment I met him.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** You know what a Chip and Dale is, right?

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** You know what a Chip and Dale is?

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** There's a chipmunk.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** Don't ruin that with that horrible...

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** I don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Or maybe Dale is somebody else.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Yeah, I forget.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** Because he wears like a Hawaiian t-shirt.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:27]** I have so many childhood cartoons because that's all I... It was video games and cartoons were my thing.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** I mean, like, I was addicted to cartoons.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:38]** Like, I would wake up... One of my favorite things was we went to my aunt's house in Utah and she had satellite TV, which played East Coast, West Coast, and Mountain Time.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:45]** And so like, I was like, I woke up at like four in the morning and I timed out and I was like, cause there's two of my favorite shows to be on at the same time.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** But since I had the East Coast and West Coast, I'd be like, oh, I can watch this one at this time.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** And then like come back later and watch it that time.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** I'd stack my cartoons and watch them for like hours every Saturday morning.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** Anyways, some of the ones I really got to call out is like Samurai Pizza Cats was so much fun.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** What?

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:26]** Samurai Pizza Cats oh it's so good it's these three cats that work at a pizza place but then like they gotta go fight you know aliens and monsters and so they shoot out of the top of the pizza place and they're dressed out in like samurai techno armor and so good do you guys wanna play a one shot where you're all cats who work at a pizza place Samurai Pizza Cats do do do do do do do Will sorry I cut you off you sound like the Khajiit from Skyrim sorry I cut you off Will sorry


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:42]** i was gonna say it's a slightly more evolved uh teenage mutant ninja turtles yeah it is that right i think it was it was definitely like a parody of all that stuff yeah which is awesome i love it i want to watch it um a lot of the early anime were pretty cool like ronin warriors and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:06:17]** about that awesome show I like the like weird ones like the Mighty Ducks TV show yeah that was good the four ducks they had like superpowers or like Mummy's Alive so like Mighty Ducks where they were actually ducks that were the Mighty Ducks team yeah and also they were superheroes yeah that's ridiculous but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a classic I have like the VHS tapes of like the whole series oh I have the VHS tapes of the movie the first movie is like dark I have all my toys still yes

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:34]** yeah oh yeah of course i actually i knew the guy that designed those toys like he was the modeler for most of the toys like sign my shredder yeah probably yeah let's get him on the pod yeah let's interview him this is a way cooler intro that john was planning


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** What was your original question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** That was a great segue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Come on.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:43]** Something we've done but we didn't do again for a long time.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** You set it up and I'm going to spike it, Will.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Something we didn't do in a long time.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** Ask a question that your characters would answer.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Everyone's favorite topic.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** False.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** It's only mine.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** Because we've all lambasted this idea.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** But I have a good set of questions for you.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** First question.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Your character.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:12]** They're in their local hamlet or Thorpe or city, wherever they are.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:17]** And a local orphanage in your town is on fire.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** And the orphans are inside.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** What do you do?

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** What in the world?

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** Let's start with Nico.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Start with Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Liabilities.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:31]** I feel like this is a character attack right now.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Okay.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** You feel attacked by what would you do with a burning orphanage?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** No, orphanage.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** Not school.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Orphanage.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** There's a fire in his school.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** Orphanage.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** And orphans are inside.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:45]** Nico calls for help, but he doesn't go inside to help himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** He jump jets away.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** He just calls them liabilities and walks off.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Sorry, jump jets away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** I don't know.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** I feel like Nico would help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Come on, Nico.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:01]** He would call for help, but he would realize he's not really qualified to go in there and help himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Okay.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** What about the rest of your characters?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:15]** I mean, Hears would get his... Hears ran a crew back in the day, so he would have his crew help put it out and get them away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Dang, we're learning more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** Plus, we do acts of public service and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:24]** Just from a naval perspective, a lot of sailors are very good firefighters.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** Pirates are probably pretty good at putting out fires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** Is that a pickup line that you use as a sailor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Yeah, you know, I was also... Well, I was.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** I was a volunteer firefighter.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:37]** And on submarines, at least, we don't have, like, dedicated DC crewmen, which are, like, damage control.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** So everybody on a submarine is also qualified as a firefighter or ship's crew damage control.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I didn't know that.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** That's awesome.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** So it makes sense that pirates are good at putting out fires.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** So would Rick put out the fire?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** They are.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** I don't think Rick would even attempt to put out the fire.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** He would charge in and try to grab the orphans and pull them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Rick didn't start the fire.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** Rick didn't start the fire.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** He didn't start the fire.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** What about Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** But I'll save the orphans and then I'll... Sorry, I don't know where else to go with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:25]** how's it going one days uh dr okay would uh seek to put out the fire but would uh not go as so far as to endanger himself unless uh he thought it was absolutely necessary or there was a higher purpose to serve


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:30]** He would shoot all the kids with speed injections from a distance.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** Run out.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Hurry, get out.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:32]** I'm sorry.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Hurry, get out.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Hurry, get out.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:43]** Rick19 just sits on a chair of just like lofty judgment and judges all of our actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:43 - 00:10:09]** i just said yeah that's right because i'm so much better than you guys i'll just say follow-up question you all said like i would put out a fire but like clearly the danger is the children inside which kids are inside just fun fact with firefighting the goal especially in a structure of fire is not to protect the structure it's to save the lives if a structure is burning you let it burn because who cares just contain it sorry to get like real with that but it's all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:12]** because this will impact the follow-up question.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** But all three of them were like, fight the fire, but that's not the problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** No, I was saying get help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** I said also save the kids.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** I was, you cleverly vague, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** Cleverly vague.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** A true businessman.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Don't know what I would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** There might be a coffee shop across the street that Dr. K just sits at.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Keep your options open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Got to make sure I don't do a PR misstep.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** Exactly.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Follow-up question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Follow-up.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** The home of a local money lender who just foreclosed on an orphanage.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Their home is on fire.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** What do you do?

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Wait, what, John?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** What'd you say?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:52]** The home of a local money lender who just foreclosed on an orphanage.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** Now the money lender's home is on fire.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Rick charges him and saves his life.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Okay.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:04]** Here's would save his life and then throw more fire onto the building somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** Nika would walk up to the building, lock the door, and walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Wow.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:20]** is going to give his pirate answer that he wishes heroes had given, but I'll give it.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:27]** I would go in and loot the place for all the stuff.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** He has a lot of good stuff.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:33]** He's got a lot of good stuff from screwing over orphans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** It's better in my hands than getting burned.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** He actually makes rounds of the orphanage before closing.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** He's like, give me all your lunch money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:48]** It's like getting all their... This is a good start for your college fund.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** What if the moneylender is also trying to put their kids through college?

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** I feel like we saved his life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** Just house burned down.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** I'm sure he has insurance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Well, no.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Nico's turned him into orphans, so they'll be at the orphanage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Oh my god, the irony.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Or just killed them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Unless they were out at school for the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:30]** yeah that's true that's true yeah see those questions weren't bad they were good questions right so we're cool good yeah good we should say before we start that we wanted to uh uh thank jeremy for uh yes that's right yeah so last last episode we had a question about the firm you know how food works in starfinder and i put up on discord and within an hour jeremy hopped on and was like

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:40]** Yeah, and gave us his answer of like, food, it's there, but it's not really a part of the Starfinder world unless it's just for roleplay.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** Should I just read him the quote?

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** No, I'm not going to do that to you.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** I'll leave it at that.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** There's more detail.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** That was very hard.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** We really appreciate you.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** I like the answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** And honestly, when you hire the firm, you get results.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:00]** Have you or a loved one been diagnosed with mesothelioma?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** Don't call Nico.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Don't call Nico.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** Just lock the door in your house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Oh, it's so good.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** I love it.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** All right.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** You guys want to play?

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:15]** Should we play?

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** Let's do it.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** No.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I'm scared.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** What's going to happen?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Record scratch.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:22]** What?

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Oh, okay.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I mean, yes.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** The answer is I want to play.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** No, I don't want to be in the situation that Rick is in.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Well, he's blinded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** I think he has a disadvantage.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** I'm not blinded.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** No, no.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** The other guy is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I don't think it's the other guy.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:38]** I think there's something else going on in the room that's causing us both to be afraid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** But before I forget, John.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:49]** Since I am constructed, I have a plus two to saves against mind effects.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Just remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** That's fine.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Well, you need to remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** I remembered it.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** I'm telling you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:07]** But I thought there was something where with androids, because you're an android, you're kind of humanoid, so you take the worst of both things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** Count as both base type and constructs, whichever is worse.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:17]** Plus two saved a disease, mind control, or mind effects, poison, and sleep.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** Unless it would affect a construct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Okay, so it's plus two?

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Yep.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Cool.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Excellent.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Fantastic.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** So, for everyone...

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:33]** just to bring you up to speed last week, the ferrofluid ooze was not too much of a threat.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** It was intense.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** It attached to Dr. Okay.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:53]** There could have been ferrofluid ooze mixing with Dr. Okay's slug-ness, but some quick thinking from the fire damage, from the fire nation, from the fire damage caused the ferrofluid ooze to fall to the ground.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Damn.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:59]** and hears wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah overheats and melts.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Is that what overheat sounds like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** By the way, what does overheat sound like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:10]** I think it sounds like... As you feel yourselves getting all cold.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** Like taking all your heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:21]** Conversely, it could also sound like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** Get up!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Very nice.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:32]** Also, shout out to Mark Hamill for playing Fire Lord Ozai on Avatar The Last Airbender.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** Shout out to Lord Hamill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Shout out to Lord Hamill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Lord Hamill.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** People need to learn about him.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** He's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** He also played the monkey on that show, too.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Like the spirit monkey at the end of the season one.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** Spoilers.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** Yeah, that's probably what he's the best known for.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** He also did the Joker.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** The guy's been all over the place.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** I don't think he's been anything bigger than that, though.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** He's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Mark Hamill, if you're listening, you're an idol.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Mark Hamill, we love you for many reasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Please come on the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Yes.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** With The Rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Well, The Rock does listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** Yeah, but we're still waiting on him to get back to us about when he's going to come on and interview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** Well, he's just too busy working out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:22]** So you guys have two doors ahead of you, much like the corridor to the south.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** Corridor to the north, door to the left, door to the right.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** You guys go in the left door.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:36]** You open up into this room that is also not as damaged as some of the other spaces, but has two rotating purple lights.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:45]** All the computer consoles are down except for some along the western wall with red holographic lights or displays.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Holographic?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Holographic displays.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Hmm.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:54]** It's pretty dark when you guys first open the door, but you do sense, I think it was Dr.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:59]** O.K., you do sense something behind one of the tubes, this giant test tubes.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:04]** And it seems to be this chitinous material, some sort of creature.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:11]** As you're trying to figure out what's going to happen next, you guys are positioning, moving around.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** You do talk to it and you hear this sound.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:35]** and this loud voice comes through you all get into combat there's a grenade that's thrown and everything goes down until here's smartly discovers that there's a light blindness for this creature

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** throws up some dancing lights.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** You can see what's going on.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** Rick says, I'm going to take action.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** I'm going to go in.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:53]** And as you go in, there is this impending sense of fear and doom and everything welling up inside of you.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** And maybe because you're an android, you got that plus two.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** You're better able to put it down.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:01]** But we ended where you need to make a will save.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** Now is the time to make that will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** We'll save!

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** This time on We'll Save, Kevin rolls.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Kevin rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** I rolled a three.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** That's amazing.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** He's done for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** But I have a plus three, so I'm at six, and then I have a plus two on top of that, so I'm at eight.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** I probably still fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** His will surely broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Okay.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** He had a will fail.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** A will fail.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** Thanks.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** Yeah.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Yeah.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's what they call them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Yes, no, yes.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** No.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** You can't fish for a pet.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Like, if somebody's like, oh, yeah, you got a pun, it's good.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** But, like, you can't be like, guys, I got a pun.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Come on.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** That was really good.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Come on.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** That was pretty good.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** You're just sore because it was on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** I'm not sore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:53 - 00:19:15]** i'm not sore so eight is not enough this feeling overcomes you and maybe the end you had ended saying you know we come here to help you we're friends and maybe your voice quivers a little bit at the end because you feel this fear and you're shaken

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** For a round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** One round.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** One round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** John.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** Will.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** I can't help but notice.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Yeah.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:28]** That on roll 20, I can't see a thing.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** You are.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:32]** You know what that's called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** The blinding condition.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** JK.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** I can see the whole room now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Oh, there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:44]** Yeah, so I put in the four dancing lights that Hears had cast into the room.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:50]** You can clearly see this bolida behind one of the tubes.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:54]** It does appear to be blinking, saying, that's unbelievable.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** Unbelievable.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** Hears, did you just move out of turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** I believe he did.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** I only did it to see the dancing lights.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** It's not an actual move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I got it.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** I was like, it is Rick.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** You have moved in.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** You are shaken.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** What are you going to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Um,

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:16]** I think I'm going to roll... I have terrible diplomacy.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** I don't even know if I have diplomacy.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** I have a plus one for diplomacy.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:25]** So yeah, I'm going to use that diplomacy and say like, I feel the fear too, but I think we can get through this.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Let us work together.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** And I rolled a 15 for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** Fifteen is... Not a lot.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:43]** Fifteen is enough that maybe you think the creature heard you, for sure, but... Oh, I didn't talk loud enough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Do I need to repeat myself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Yeah, you need to roll again.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:56]** Now, you are like, whatever is affecting you is affecting this creature and has been affecting this bolita for a long time.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:03]** So whatever you said to it, it's probably not going to change until whatever's affecting you and the creature ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** Can I also do a perception on the room?

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Maybe something else.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Sure.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** That will let me know, because clearly there's something in the room that's causing this.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Yeah.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** This fear.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yeah.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:23]** Yeah, because I don't have mysticism, so I'll do perception.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Using different dice.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:31]** 18 plus... Perception plus 4 is 22.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Awesome.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** You are...

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** You are able to tell a couple things.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:41]** Give me a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** I just rolled off.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** You make me roll other stuff.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Jesus.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** And I'm also shaken, so all these rolls are going low.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** So that's an 18 plus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Great.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** 19.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Okay.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** I'll say this.

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:05]** You know that this is some sort of fear frequency that is some sort of infrasound that is much lower than any audible hearing.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** And it is shaking your body and producing this fear effect in you.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:15]** It's coming from multiple speakers hidden in the room.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:23]** You're confident that there's one in the corner of the room right to your right, and it's likely that there are more in the other corners of the room.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** That's what the wisdom save told you, was that there's more than one.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:31]** But you know that there's one in the room, and I revealed it for you on Roll20 so you know which square to go to.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** You can localize where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:57]** i'm going to leave this up to gm interpretation um because you can't move do something and then move again yeah but i haven't taken my action yet um so can i finish my move action well but you see the problem is that you did you did a diplomacy check you didn't say that's i'll leave it at that then because that the diplomacy check is my standard action is what you're saying yeah

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:05]** Which is fair, because the book does say for certain skills, it would be... Which is up to the GMs per... Yeah, I had a sheet for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Let me give it one second.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Let me just see where that is.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:13]** Skills... Combat skills cheat sheet.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:21]** It tells you what the... Somebody, not sure who, if this is you and you are a listener... The book says leave it up to the GM's discretion.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** That's fine.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:28]** But I specifically found somebody who made an unofficial thing, and I... Where's the...

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Yeah, there's no copyright on here.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** So we're good into the firm.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** But if you made this, thank you.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:39]** Diplomacy, I'm going to go with that was a change attitude, right?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** That's what you're trying to do.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** And that falls under...

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** It says one minute minimum.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:48]** I'm going to say that that's probably a standard action because you were like thinking of what to say.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** You're trying to combat the shake effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** That's fair.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** So Rick Rick notices the the camera in the corner.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** Yep.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** And that's kind of the speaker.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** Let's be the speaker.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Sorry.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Yeah.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** I see a camera.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** It looks like a camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** You do actually.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:02]** Thank you for running me.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** You do notice that there's a camera.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:27]** behind you that is in the door much like in some of the other rooms where they're right above the door no that's um that's like near the door that you are at right now wait so is this a camera or speaker what i what i showed you is a loudspeaker there is a small camera next to the door and the panel behind you next to the door you did also find that out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** All right.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:32]** But yeah, Rick will then... That's kind of the end of his turn.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:35]** But he recognizes that the speaker is kind of the source.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** Okay.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Okay.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** Okay.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Yeah.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:49]** So you come in, you're afraid, you are not sure, you think that you know what's going on, and you try to tell it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** You tell us about the speakers and the noise.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** My palms are still out and my axe is down, so I'm trying not to feel like not threatening at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:04]** And you try to figure out, you try to talk to the creature, right?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:14]** So this creature, as you talk in response, that same... You understand now the quivering in the voice.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** You understand why this was happening.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:23]** And you hear this voice come from back there.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** And now that you can see it, you can see its mandibles and its mouth opening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** And you can hear... Make it stop!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** You can make it stop!

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Stop!

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:50]** But for some reason, as if compulsion seems to push them, they come around the corner, and they come up to attack you, and they move around, and they come up, and they take that long pike that they have, and they are going to attack you.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** That is going to be a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Are you serious?

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** A critical hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:07]** It's almost like this creature is just driven out of fear, but it's confusing because it's telling you to stop, but it's still trying to make you stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** No, he should only be shaken.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:12]** Or, sorry, he or she, it should only be shaken.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** They should only be shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** You know that they are not just shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** There's a lot going on.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** But that's all that I'm infected with, so... But you haven't been here for a long time.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** That's my defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:23]** That's your defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** God, wow.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** That's what my son tells me all the time when I get upset at him.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** He just goes...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Yep.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** I'm trying to see if there's anything with the blinding condition now.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Ah, mischance.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** I need to roll a mischance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** Yep.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Yep.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** Because you technically have total concealment.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** I need... It's a 50% mischance, which...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** Total concealment because he's blinded?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** Yeah, that's how the blinded works.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:56]** You have to treat all creatures as having total concealment because I can't observe you.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** So if I get above a 50, it's a lot of damage.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** And if I get below, you're cool.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** I roll a 20.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** You're cool.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:30]** It comes and it's not right near your face, but you can tell that the fervor with which this bolita stabbed seems like it would have given you, spoiler, 19 points of damage as this thing would have just speared you like a harpoon.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** This thing does not play.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Rick doesn't even flinch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:41]** He looks at the creature in his eyes and just tries to compel that he's not being a threat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:47]** Again, whatever is happening in this room, if you want it to stop, that may help.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** It is Nico's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** What are you doing from outside the room?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** So, Nico, did he hear all that going on?

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Like, make it stop, make it stop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:04]** There are speakers causing this frequency that is making everyone scared.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** I feel it as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** I like that your voice doesn't change even with it.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** Nico's going to be like... Okay.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** Well, if I die... Well, it doesn't matter.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** You guys won't warn me if I die.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** And he's just going to go charging in.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** And he's going to use his jump jets from the start of the door...

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:31]** to go on top of some furniture here in the center, and he's going to do a perception check when he gets there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** So you can't get quite on top of there because those tubes are standing, so you can be right next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** Okay.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Just trying to get a little bit of a train bonus there.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:46]** Sorry, I just... Well, if you're going to go that far back, you need to make a check, like an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:51]** He just walks to the door, turns on his jump jets just to fly 20 feet, and that's it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Such a strange choice of chapters.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** How many times a day can you use these things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:01]** I thought there were some tables over there where I might be able to get some high ground and be able to get a good look around the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:08]** There is a table over there, but where you're standing, you're right next to a table.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:12]** You could stand on that, but it's not going to mechanically change anything for you to be on a table.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:36]** down you also have to roll a will save for entering yeah so you need to roll an acrobatics check and then you need to first you need to roll a will save and then you need to roll an acrobatics check all right here comes the will save that's 13 plus 5 for an 18 nice you are fine you're able to push down that feeling that's welling as soon as you stepped in you felt it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** And Kevin grimaces as though he was wishing for the other outcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** I kind of was.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** I don't know.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, you were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** You were.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** You're waiting for me to fail right now.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Roll an acrobatics check.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:49]** I'm sure there's something for flying here, but I'm going to roll it all into an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** I just want you to see you fail while jetpacking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** I just want you to know consequence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** That's all.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:00]** So that's nine on the die plus seven for, what, 16?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** Yeah, you're able to fly, but it was DC 15.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:10]** Your boot, like, hits the thing right as you're going past the tube there.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** You're able to land on the table because you succeeded, but it was a close call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** Because, like, the Wish version of Star Wars from Marvel.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** The Wish version of Star Wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** What do you mean the Wish version?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** You order from Wish.com.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** It gives you the really bad ads for everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** You're the one that takes like seven weeks to get to you.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** The Wish thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** I've never ordered from Wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** Nico, does that fit into all of your movement?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Because you were pretty far back.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** That's 10, 15.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** How much movement do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:43]** And then I think I can use my jump jets for an extra 20.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** I can go up to 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** So here's the thing.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** This is a rules lawyer question.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:55]** I think if you can both fly and move a land speed, you still can't move more than your max speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Yeah, unless the jump jets allow you to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** Yeah, so you can still only move up to whatever your max speed is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** What do the jump jets say, Nick?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Jump jets.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:11]** You can achieve jump jets as part of a move action in order to fly during your movement.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:19]** You can fly up to 30 feet average maneuverability with a max height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** You must land at the end of your move action.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** Jump jets can't lift you if you're encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** So it doesn't sound like... I think you moved more than 30 feet.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, it doesn't sound like you can go past 30 feet.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** It's not like you get an additional 30 feet.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** It's you can move up to 30 feet.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** If that's your max speed, that's how far you can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:43]** I don't mean to shoot you down because you're flying and everything, but... I'm fine too, Jeb, because you're rooting for me to fail you.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** So lying doesn't suit you, Kevin.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** It is my role to shoot you down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** I shot down here's last time with a cool unseen servant thing.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** I got to shoot you down with this.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:01]** It is really cool, but the rules are so explicit that I got to say you can't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** So how far can I move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** You can move right next to Rick.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:07]** You can move right right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** Average maneuverability, yeah, with a maximum of height.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:15]** So basically the jump jets basically allow you to fly the distance that you would move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:20]** Okay, well then I will forego the jump jets then.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:26]** And then I'll walk in and I'll be 10 feet away from Rick to get a good look around the room.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** Just to get away from Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** 15, 20, 20.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Okay, yeah, makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:57]** okay yeah and you're rolling perception check yeah that's your move action give me a perception check wait make him roll he already rolled the wills to go in the room oh that's right yeah yeah that's right or did you forget about i'm just playing by the rules man and the shaken effect would would definitely impact your perception check it would if you would it would you're right i'm sorry i i have a very short memory i'm a goldfish

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Yeah.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** As I'm making goldfish face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** What's your perception check, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Get this party rolling.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** That's 25.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** 25.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Yeah.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:19]** You are able to, again, tell that even though you aren't affected by this fear infrasound frequency, you can confirm you are localizing it in the corners.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** And I'm just going to say that with that 25, you're able to know.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:27]** I'm going to reveal all the speakers that are in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Wait, he also has dark vision or doesn't have dark vision.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** No, I don't have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:39]** But the room is lit well enough for this round that you'll find from Fred the Dancing Lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** Just check it.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Just check it.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:48]** I'll argue the same for everybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** It's fine.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** Okay.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:49]** All right.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:49]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** That's a smokescreen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** Doctor, do you want to do anything else with your turn, Nico?

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Can I do anything else?

**[00:33:54 - 00:34:00]** I feel like a move action and then a will save with a reflex save plus perception.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** I don't think I should be able to make an attack.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** I feel like that would be a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:09]** As the rules layer, I would say you'd still have a standard action.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** I agree with that.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** As the other player, I don't think you should attack because I think this thing is clearly trying to defend itself.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** I'm just going to leave it at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** You have a standard action.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** That you can use for whatever you want.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** You can delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:29]** Nico will try a persuasion.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Nico will try persuasion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:36]** Persuasion takes a standard action because you're trying to... Is there persuasion?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Yeah, there's persuasion.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** But I think it would be diplomacy.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** No, diplomacy.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** It's diplomacy.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** It would be diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** Yeah, so I'll roll a diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** To change attitude?

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Okay.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** What's that?

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** To change attitude.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** That's the technical term that you would be doing.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** You're trying to change its attitude from being hostile to something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** And you can do that with a diplomacy or an intimidation check.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:05]** Only so long as I don't violate my move action here right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Yeah.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Hey!

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** Those are just the basic rules of the game, bro.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** I just picture you hovering with your jets.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** It's like you're on a Segway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Everywhere you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** It's the Segway tour of the labs.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** That's a 21, a natural 12 plus nine.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** What do you say?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** What do you say?

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:38]** And he's going to see like, look, if you want us to make it stop, stand down for a moment.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:43]** Let us shoot these speakers and you'll be out of your misery.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** But if you attack us, we will be forced to put you down.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Just stop.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** Please just stop for a couple seconds.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** We're all high key right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** All right.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** What happens next?

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** It's not their turn.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** That was Nico's turn.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** Dr. K, what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:11]** So from before, when I was in front of this doorway and I could peer in, where was the computer with the holographic pad?

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Sorry, you said where is the computer with the holographic pad?

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:21]** There was a partially lit holographic computer pad you described, I believe.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** That was... On the left side of the room.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Would I know where that is?

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** The western.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** Those red lights that you see on the western side of the room, those are the... Here?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Nope.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** The red lights.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Well, I'm going to beeline it for those.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** Okay, so you're going to come in, move past Rick.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:45]** So I think you could move past without it taking an attack of opportunity, but you would know that from its long thing, it has a 10 foot reach.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** So I think you can move without, I think you can move in past Rick.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Oh, but then you're going to move.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** No, because I think you're within that 10 feet.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Let's see.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Yeah, that's 10 feet.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** So it's going to get an attack of opportunity on you as you move past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Okay.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Oh, wow.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Yeah.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** Same thing with Niko.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:31]** yeah although wait let me see sorry and and more rules lawyer stuff uh just got another message on discord somebody pointed out that on page 400 it's actually page uh 404 of the core rule book there is a rule about starvation so it's but it deals with like days so if you haven't gone for food for gone with food for three days there are some penalties if you haven't gone for water without one day uh without water for a day there's penalties there but i feel like we've been pretty safe on food


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:34]** That's actually really good to know.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** I think you guys have been safe on food, but thank you for bringing that to my attention.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** I will consider that for the future.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** Thanks, Lightning Cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** Lightning Cat!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** Nico and Dr. Okay, I rescind my statement.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Maybe I will delete this or condense it to a very quick thing.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:53]** Because it is blinded, it is also flat-footed, and when you're flat-footed, you cannot take reactions.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** So you're good to go.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** You can move past.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** You're good to go.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Cool.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Keep going.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Sorry about that.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Sorry for the interruption.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** No, it's good to bring up these rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** It's good to know.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:09]** I think I can sneak... So, is there like a... Where's the path to get to it?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** You can... I think this is about as far as I can get.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** Or can I go this way?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** You were right here.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Straight.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Well, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:23]** But not knowing... To get past Nico and past that tube that's broken...

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** On one side, you're going to need to squeeze.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** That's going to take an extra five feet of movement.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Pretty sure that's the rule for squeezing in Starfinder.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Squeezing, entangled.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Yeah, well, move half speed.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:40]** You would have to move half your speed to get through something that's squeezing like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** So to go up to the diagonal, you'd be fine.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Yeah, can I double move?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Yeah, you can double move.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** You would just use your move action.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Your standard action would be your move action.

**[00:38:51 - 00:39:14]** yeah i'm gonna do that then okay so this is pretty sure that's the case is that right rules lawyer kev so i wasn't paying attention can you use your move action gets me right here can you use your move action your standard action as a move action yes yes you can do your set you can use that's what i thought cool okay so you're getting all the way over there i like it yeah you need to make a will save as you start going through

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** As you come into the room.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** 18.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:26]** Ooh, you felt that fear come into your body, shaking your slug body, and you are okay.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:29]** You're able to push it down for now.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** Good move.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** Heading over to the computers in the western side of the room, it seems like.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** Here's, what are you doing from outside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:59]** only person not affected by this or uh not experiencing this frequency yeah here's uh being good at computers and engineering can he detect from afar where which terminal for example is likely uh creating this sound or running this program or whatever it is it's doing this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:05]** I think you're pretty able to, like, you would just know that probably any of these would be able to work on it.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** You don't need to go to a specific one.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Oh, okay.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Yep.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Yep.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** Right.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Well, it looks like Dr. Okay is like on it anyway.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Okay.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Okay.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:20]** So here's this going to then, what's one more thing?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:27]** Here's just going to... Okay, but he's sure that it's coming from a computer and not a magical source or something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** It's coming from these loudspeakers that are in the wall.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:34]** If you wanted to go to the computer to try and disable what's going on, sure.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:38]** If you wanted to go right to the loudspeakers, that's fine, too.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Give me a... You know what?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:44]** Give me a... Give me an engineering check.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** 23.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** 23.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:54]** Yeah, you're able to know that Rick probably mentioned the camera that was in the door.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Of course I did.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Yeah.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** I'm just going to say that you did.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:13]** You know that you would be able to, if you could get into that camera, maybe there's something that would override the camera because the people who created it, right, would need something to be able to control it, not just from the computers.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:17]** So if you wanted to try and hack the camera near the door, you could do that too.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** There's more than one way to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:28]** That means that someone is actively doing this and it's not just like a passive thing because if we're hacking the camera, they're controlling this sound thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:58]** i wouldn't say that far i would just think that the technology has been built into the camera to also control this frequency as well where's the camera it's at the far it's at it no no it's right next to the door it's just that it's just like to the left of the door oh okay yeah because here's like reach it's like a it's a it's a ring yeah i'm like it's a ring because here's just kind of like reach a little arm around without going into the room yeah i'm gonna say that you would still make a will save your just hits the off button and then

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:23]** or i'll say this the dc will go up if you just want to reach your arm in but you won't need to make a will save or you can go into the room make a will save and the dc will stay what the dc is i guess i'll try to do it from out here okay so then um okay so that's computers or engineering it's gonna be computers let's say computers sorry nice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** I'm confused.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** So he's able to reach around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** Well, so here's the thing.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Here's the thing.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** It will give me every time.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** It gets me every time, too.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:38]** Because of your good engineering check, it's going to take you a full round to do that.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** So you've already moved.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** So you can't do it now.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Oh, okay.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Fair enough.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** It's a full action.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** It has to be the only thing that you do.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** That's fine.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** You were generous with... Oh, you mean like the computer hacking right now?

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Yeah.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** It's going to take a full round.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** But I can do it now.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Well, you moved.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** I have to wait.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** You moved already.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** I can't do it now.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** You can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** I can't.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Super, cannot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:10]** Even though what I did before was just a skill check, but because you're being generous with what that enabled me to find out, I can't do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** No, because you were on the other side of the corridor and then you moved up.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** You used some of your movement to do that.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:18]** I'll say that if you want to do it now, I'm going to increase the DC.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** You realize now it's the full action stuff?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Like twice, yeah.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:24]** Yeah, so I'm going to increase it twice because one, you're not looking, and two, it should be a full round action.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** So it's going to be tough to hit.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Do a little bit tough to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** But I might as well do it.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** I have nothing to lose.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** If you want to try it, why not?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** I could try it, yeah.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** And then if not, I could try it again next time.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Yep.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Well, I rolled a 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** You rolled a 29?

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Yeah.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** I had in my head DC 29.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** I just came up with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Well done, Kelly.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** I came up with that before you said 29.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:55]** Because I was like, I feel like that's probably one of the hardest things.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** Yeah.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** You are able.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Something happens.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** You're not sure what, but...

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:11]** That feeling in Rick, Nico, and Dr. OK seems to dissipate out of nowhere and goes down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** I succeeded on my will save.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** I don't have that.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** That's true.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** But you still felt it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** It's like being nauseous, but you don't throw up.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** It's just not being succumbed to.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Yeah.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** You're still feeling it.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** So I'm no longer shaken, you're saying, though?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** You are no longer shaken at the end of here's a turn.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:29]** When it becomes your turn next, you will no longer be shaken.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Oh, dope.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** What else do you want to do with your turn here?

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** I think that's it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** I think that's everything you can do.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** I think that's it, yeah.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Okay.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Top of round four.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Rick19, it is your turn.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** You are no longer shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** What do you do?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:52]** His palms are still down, and he's got his axe low, and he kind of turns his head to the left, and he talks over his shoulder, and he says, Great work, Hears.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** Whatever you did fixed it.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** But then he walks.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:03]** He's going to side scoot cautiously past the creature and say, I think we might have solved this.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:08]** And he reaches up and he stabs the speaker.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Okay.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Do you want to do a hit check on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** So, Rick, you move past.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** You go to stab it.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Make an attack roll.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Actually, I'll probably stay right here.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** So I make an attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:23]** I got a five plus, but I'm no longer shaken.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Plus five.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** So that's a 10 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** You are fine.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** How much damage do you do as you go?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** It's kind of hidden behind the wall.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:33]** There's like fabric there and it looks just like metal.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:37]** But as soon as you go to stab through, you do pierce the fabric.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Oh, this is a D12 plus four.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Roll high.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I got to find my 12.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** I found it.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Found my 12.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Found it.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Two plus five is seven.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** Or sorry, six plus four is six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Six points of damage.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** It goes through.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** You feel it hit something.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** But you don't feel anything break.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** This is an object, and we haven't had to do this very often.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** It has a hardness.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** You didn't exceed the hardness.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** You have to exceed the hardness to do any damage.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** You didn't exceed the hardness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** But do I want to do a diplomacy or something to show?

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:14]** I'm trying to show the creature, like, you know, we're not the threat, like these speakers are.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:18]** And you said the fear has stopped, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** The fear has stopped, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** So do I do a diplomacy on that, or are you just going to play it as is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:30]** Let's play it as is because it clearly made it seem like you're trying to go stop it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:35]** Not to mention I rolled a 21 on my last diplomacy check for this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** But the way diplomacy works, Nick, is that they have tiers.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:47]** And so if this creature was on the three tiers down to the negative, then we have to work our way back to positive.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Yeah.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Okay.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** And only John knows where that tier is.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Is that the rest of your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** And then he does a little jig.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** No, I'm kidding.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** That doesn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** He does the floss.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** He starts with his axes.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** He's flossing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** He starts flossing in front of the creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** I told you it wasn't us.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** Thank God it's blind.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:16]** Yeah, because that would work directly against your diplomacy role.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** It would stay hostile.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** It would stay super hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** That's funny.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** It would just become more afraid.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** Alright, so...

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:54]** as you as soon as it stops and then rick you step over you try and stab not it because for a second maybe it seems like you're about to take a step and stab and then you turn right and you don't mean to but you turn i picture he's like he kind of like sidesteps and he still has that left palm open and he just uses one hand that's probably why he didn't hit so strongly it was just because he just kind of jabbed with one hand up towards the speaker

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:01]** So as you step over and you start to stab the speaker, it doesn't quite break.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:08]** But as that happens, you look back and here's you're right there standing in the doorway looking at this Bolita.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:11]** Nico, you're, you know, 10, 15 feet away.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** Dr. O'Keefe, you're across the room.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:18]** So you hear this happen as that feeling subsides of fear, this infrasound.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:26]** And when that happens, the pipe, the weapon that it's holding drops to the ground.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Nice.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:36]** And the legs collapse and this creature kind of falls and the front half falls.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** They stick out their hands.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** I think kind of look at you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** You made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Stop.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** It just their eyes closed and they pass out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:09]** rick drops his his axe and kind of like picks it up um i'm gonna do a quick medicine check we're still in initiative order what what else is in this room


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:32]** okay keep going so it is nico's turn what do you do nico shoots nico with his dueling sword out he's going to activate his jump jets and he's going to slash he's going to slash at the um at that speaker over here in the okay so you move southeast corner yeah you're fine okay make an attack roll

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:39]** That's a seven plus.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Oh, come on.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Please be enough.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Please be enough.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Please be enough.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Seven plus four.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Thank God.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** That's an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Okay.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:51]** So you do pierce the hidden panel that the speaker is behind.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** You slashed it.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Roll your damage.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Slashed it.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Slashed it.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** So I'm going to use a combat expertise on this.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** And I'm going to use it for my dueling sword.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:06]** Wait, John, would an inanimate object have a CR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** No.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Okay.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** So CR is zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Yeah.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** So just 15.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** DC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** All right.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** So I got an 11 then on the attack roll.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:24]** That is why I don't succeed on the combat expertise.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** So I don't get to add anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:30]** The DC is... Because the attack roll is to hit the target.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Does that attack roll also translate to the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** No, sorry.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I take that back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** No, I don't think that's... Yeah, you've got a separate roll for that, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:42]** Okay, so you want me just to roll the combat expertise belatedly, or you're not going to give it to me?

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** What skill are you using to roll the combat expertise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** What does it say?

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** Yeah, what's... Okay, so you... You're going to try to bluff a speaker?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** Yeah, how do you bluff a speaker?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Yeah, I am.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** What else can you do besides bluff?

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:59]** Because I feel like bluff might not work because it's an inanimate object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** You could use computers.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** No, you have to select the skill.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** You can add different skills at different times.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** I'm only allowed to use bluff for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Because you chose that when you got the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** That's correct.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Okay.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Got it.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** So then I don't think you can bluff a speaker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:12]** All right.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Well, then I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** The speaker duck can be like, it'll just be an attack.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** Whoa!

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** You don't say, speaker.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** What were you sounding off about?

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** A voice comes out of the speaker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** I'm not laughing at you, Nick.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** I'm laughing with you.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** At least I'm laughing with the other guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** All right, that is five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:41]** Okay, again, slash through, hits clearly the speaker, doesn't break the hardness of the speaker.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** So the speaker doesn't break.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** They're hard speakers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Good God.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Crazy.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Yeah.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** I think I'm going to have to shoot this thing next time.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Here's what he's doing.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Oh, no, it's Dr. Okay.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** Are you asking what's my turn, right?

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Yes.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** So can I access this computer?

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** No.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** if you want.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Yeah.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:08]** I'd like to access this computer and see if it's secured or unsecured and maybe see if somebody's monitoring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** I don't know.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** Okay.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** So you sit down at the speaker or at the computer.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:29]** If you're trying to find out info about the it is secured you can make a computer check to unsecure it and I'm just going to say as part of like moving past the security you can find the

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:49]** info on the trap okay here we go here goes nothing 15 on the die plus 10 is a 25 okay all right 25 is enough to break through the security of the computer

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Nice.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** You do.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** You are able to go in.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** Weirdly, there's a folder that says trap info.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:01]** It's right on the, you know, right in the homepage, right on the desktop.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Yeah.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** Yeah.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:03]** It's right there.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** And you open it up.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Do you speak Kekul?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** You do.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** I do.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** You do.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Great.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Give me a culture check.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** Culture... 21.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** 21.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Ooh, good culture check.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** Looking through, putting together the translation, based on everything...

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:38]** This is a fear frequency experiment room where they were testing using infrasound to elicit fear and control and create, you know, and manipulate creatures in whatever way they wanted to.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:50]** This psychic fear frequency that they made, it came from basic Lushinta plans and data.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** How they got that?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Not in here.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Where it came from?

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Not in here.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** But it's just references.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:02]** It came from some sort of Lushunta research into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** This is what we found earlier.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** I don't know why I'm just realizing that.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Yeah.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** The weapon of sound.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Oh, geez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:20]** Well, yeah, so as you were in the original hub and you found information about an experiment with fear and a fear infrasound frequency, this is that room where that's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** I remember we were making brown note jokes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Yep, yep, yes.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:35]** You can guess, Dr. O'Keefe, as you're reading through, that the reason that there are three test tubes that are not broken, they're empty.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** There's nothing in them.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** This one that was broken...

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** This Bolita was probably in there from looking at the trap.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** And as you can see, this thing would just keep running.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:54]** If Hears hadn't been able to nail that 29 literally on the dot, if you hadn't done that, this fear frequency would have kept going.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:59]** You all would have had to roll another will save the next turn because it just will keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:02]** One turn is pretty short for any kind of effect like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:08]** Yeah, so this Bolita has probably been experiencing this for weeks.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Ah, poor guy.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Wow.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** It sucks.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Wow.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** It hurts my heart.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:21]** That's what it seems like in terms of, like, just in those six seconds of getting in, moving through, thinking about it, those are kind of the highlights that you grab as you're going through and looking.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Uh...

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:31]** So is there any way to... I guess I'm looking at the computer skill.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:36]** I don't see... I'm just trying to understand why we're still in initiative order.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Is somebody watching us?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:43]** Can I, like... I guess it wouldn't be a fake shell.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** It's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** There's no fake shell.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:51]** Your role was high enough, I'll say, that you can tell that the system that you got into is not a fake shell.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** It's the real deal.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** It's whatever these greys were doing in here.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** This is the same interface that they went through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Are you going to call out to the rest of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:02]** Yeah, I'll tell everybody else, like, hey, this is a fear factory.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:18]** whenever yeah that's what's going on this guy needs help don't see anything in here to really that can be of any use wait does the terminal control the the speakers as well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:49]** you do see that if you wanted to you would you would need to make another roll and it would take a minute it would take a couple rounds but you do see how you could go through and deactivate it from the computer it probably would have taken yeah what's up like metagame question is like if we don't go through this process these things are gonna turn back on it's the way i get why we're still you don't you don't think that that if you these aren't going to turn back on of their own accord so there's something else in the room


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** Or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** Oh, this thing's going to wake up and attack us anyways.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** No, I hate it.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** I hate when initiative order just stays in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:05]** Yeah, I'm just going to try and continue to turn them off.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:09]** And then, you know, just for good measure, I guess.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** I don't know.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** There's nothing else going on in here.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** And there's no other information on this machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** There's not really any other information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** It's already off.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:25]** It's not like I can go and assist at this moment with helping aid our creature friend.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** You said it's going to take a couple rounds to turn off the speakers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:37]** If you hadn't turned them off and the only thing that you were doing was trying to go through this, it would have taken 2D4 rounds to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** Oh, man, that would have sucked because then, like, you're constantly being attacked and have the will save.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Good job, Gears.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Yeah, good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** Yeah, you literally nailed the role.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** You're a hero.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** You're a hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:55]** So, Dr. K, so you were already there, so you're going to move across the room?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:59]** Well, I mean, there's nothing else on this computer, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Not that you can say no.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Okay.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:11]** So I'm going to quickly, as much as I can move back, move back to help eventually.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** The creature?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** Yeah.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Next turn, I guess.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** And I'll say, you there, what is your name?

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Let us help you.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** They're passed out.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Is there anything else in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** What do you do?

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** You're talking to ghosts?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** Come out, spirits.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Come out, spirits.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** We are not here to harm you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:46]** Here's will just quickly do a perception check if this is possible, where he just wants to see if he can sense why there's still this thick air of caution, like what might be lurking or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:50]** Are you trying to roll to metagame understand why we're still in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** I mean...

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Yeah, I guess.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** That's a fair roll.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** I'm going to roll to break the fourth wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:01]** I feel like the character would know why.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:04]** If you're in initiative order, the character's got to understand something.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Your heart's racing and you're tense.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I don't think you're in initiative order when you're sitting around doing nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** I kind of disagree.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:20]** I think that we're in initiative order because things should move as they're going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:24]** John, if we get to the end of this round and you just turn off initiative order, we're all going to be really mad.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** I don't think so.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** You're like, that's it.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** You're out of initiative order.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:29]** Why?

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Well, I mean, you said it.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** So I'll go in and I'll try to.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** Here's going to go in and try to hack these computers then to turn this stuff off.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** It's already off.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** It's already off.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** No, but prevent them from getting turned back on.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** They're not going to turn back on.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** I thought you said that they might.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** Oh, okay.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** He already did.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** No, I said that.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** I said they're not going to turn on.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** I see.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** I see.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Okay.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:55]** So we're just going to be walking around in initiative order aimlessly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** All these six seconds at a time for the rest of our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:07]** What here's we'll do then is we'll go in there and try to... You said that we could scrape the sort of information about how to take advantage of this technology or whatever in an earlier time you said that.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** So is that still true?

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Like where...

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** We could maybe gather some useful information.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Yes, it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** Was this one of the modules that you had saved or you failed on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** That's a really good question.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:19]** Let's find out.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** I think we failed.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:21]** Well, hold on.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** We failed on one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** Well, the firewall one, the root access one, you guys didn't get.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Two of them are damaged but could be repaired.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** And then another one is a paperweight.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** So give me one second here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** There are four modules.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** We got weapon frequency.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Frequency is one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Yeah, we made that one.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** That's one of the ones that is damaged, but you could repair it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** I don't even know if it is damaged.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Maybe it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** So two of them were damaged.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:54]** One was paperweight, and then the root axis one was paperweight, and then another one I feel like you got, and it was also paperweight.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Frequency is okay, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** So two of them.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** Enough, at least, where we could repair it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** We opened the biological.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:05]** You opened all three, the biological, the demonic one, and the fear one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** We opened the frequency, infrasound.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** They're testing it on other people.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** But you pulled modules.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Right, the fourth one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** You rolled to pull them out.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Correct, yeah.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** The fourth one got erased.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:19]** Which was the data module that dealt with decontamination.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** But the other three are okay.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Oh, all three are okay.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** According to the notes...

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** All three are damaged, but could be repaired.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** At the very least, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** I think we were able to pull three of them, but the fourth one was destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** Yeah, the fourth was the decontamination of Root.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** That's correct.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:41]** Okay, so you would know that any information that's on these computers is probably in the module, too.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Okay.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:49]** So just trying to tell you that there's already information that could possibly be used there.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** Again, it's not like a perfect blueprint.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:54]** You can just go like make this right now, but you don't need to necessarily go and find more information.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:58]** You're pretty confident that any information that's there was also in this module.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:01]** But we could scavenge the machine for parts, right?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Sure.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** I think it would just add in the same way that in the central hub, you found a couple of things.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** You would just find a couple more things here, which I did.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** I'll send you later, Nick.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** All right.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** I mean, I guess yours will do that.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** There's nothing really else to do right now, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Okay.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** So you're going to go to the computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:22]** Just get whatever information slash stuff you can get or pull off of it.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Okay.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** Sorry, where are the other computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** It was just over there.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** I didn't really see much, but I left it open for you, so it shouldn't be.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Which computer?

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Which computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** It's still logged in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:32]** Where you on?

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** The one over here in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** All right, thanks.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** You log in.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** The name of the username is GrazerCool24.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** Well, we're going to change that right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:42]** Grazer not cool.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Grayson's cool, though.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** That's my son.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Yes, that's true.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** He's a great son.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Shout out to my son.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** Shout out to Grayson.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** Great follower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** In the future, when you listen to this, Grayson.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** It's past your bedtime, young man.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** His first Halloween, he's going to be a little alien.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** He's going to be a little gray.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Gray's in the gray.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** Okay, it's top of round five.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:07]** Top of round five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** What do you do?

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** I hate that we're still on initiative for no reason.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** So two things.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** I'm going to roll Perception.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:22]** I got a nine plus six for 15.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:26]** I want to see if there's any... You said that one tube was broken and that's where this guy was in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Likely.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:29]** Dr. K probably said this out loud.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:33]** That's likely where this... Yeah, there's nothing in those tubes.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:33]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** Okay, so that's my perception check.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** So there's nothing in those tubes.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:37]** We're good?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Yep.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:44]** So then I'm also going to do a medicine check on this Belita.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** First aid.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Nineteen.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** Nineteen.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** No, no, no, no.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Sorry.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:55]** Nineteen plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Nineteen plus five.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Twenty-four.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** Twenty-four.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Okay.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:04]** 24 is a good... And that's to what?

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** To wake them up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Make sure it's a... I don't know.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** What all can a medicine check do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** First aid.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Standard action.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:17]** They passed out, so... They passed out, so it's probably like wake them up, make sure they're okay.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Do they have deadly wounds?

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Long-term care?

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Long-term stability?

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** No, there's no long-term.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:27]** They didn't have deadly wounds or anything, so it would probably just be like waking them up.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** Okay.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:40]** You bend down and you gently pick up this Bolita's head.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:43]** I don't know what you do for your medicine check.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:43]** Exactly.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:47]** Maybe you've got some smelling salts or you slap them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:54]** But as you do that, they kind of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:09]** their eyes open and they look at you and there's this immediate sense of relief from them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** You connect with them instantly.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:20]** Rick, it almost, it reminds you of feeling like a, like a parent looking at your child.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** Cause they just seem very in that moment.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** They need somebody there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** I know that feeling now.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** I actually know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Wow.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** And they needed you.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:42]** And as they open their eyes, they... Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** And they start breathing.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** And they start breathing quickly.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** And their face gets sad.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:58]** Their eyes start to water.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:04]** And there's something that they... It looks like they know something.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:10]** And you see a tear start to move down their chitinous face.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:21]** And they say, I'll never make it back.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:27]** And then her eyes squint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** That's a hurt.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** And then her body jerks.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** Eyes roll back.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:32]** No!

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Violently.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** I did a medicine check.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** She's fine.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:39]** And then collapses to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** Dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** No, no, she's fine.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** I did a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** No, she's fine.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:48]** I did a medicine check.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** She's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:52]** I did a medicine check.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** Rick is holding her drooping body.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** I did a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** Rick19's going through the five stages of grief now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** I was too late.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Time for the denial phase.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** It was just too late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:09]** Hey there, you long-time listener.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** It's good to see you here at episode 39.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:20]** It's me, Jon Swan, and this one goes out to all you dungeon masters and game masters and handlers, because it's the spooky season.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** So what are you doing?

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:24]** You are writing that spooky Halloween one-shot.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:30]** You're prepping it, or maybe you just want to add some more suspense or scary content into your campaign.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** So I thought...

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:37]** why not share how I have made Kev say, my heart is racing several times because he was in the Navy.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:41]** So that must mean that I have done something right to make it suspenseful.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]** First things first, right, right, right.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]** If this is a flashback,

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:51]** Put all of your ideas, no matter how crazy or weird they are, on the paper.

**[01:07:51 - 01:08:03]** If it's for a character, try to write out some possible answers to probable questions from the PCs that align with the motivations, goals, flaws.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** Get it all out there.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]** Craft it until you're happy with it.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:10]** Then think like the player.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Think like the listener.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Use all five senses.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:28]** You don't know what one phrase you will say that will pull them into the scene, that will get their attention, that will totally immerse them in this spooky, crazy scene that you are creating.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:30]** And finally, practice, practice, practice.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** Get the music dialed in.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** Find a space to be alone.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:43]** Find a space to just say and read and embody that character over and over.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** Use all of your voices.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Use all of the intonation.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:50]** Use all of your body to really drive it home.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** And then come hang out at our Discord.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** I want to talk to you.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:57]** We all want to talk to you here at the podcast.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Come hang out with us.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** There's a DMs, GMs channel.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:03]** And frankly, I'll just talk to you about whatever you want to talk about.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]** Game mastering, dungeon mastering, or whatnot.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:13]** Until then, have a safe but frightfully spooky Halloween.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** See you next week.
