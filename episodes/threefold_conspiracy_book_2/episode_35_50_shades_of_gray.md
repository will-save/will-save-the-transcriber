**[00:00:00 - 00:00:08]** Last time on We'll Save... Our group was assailed by an unidentified biological experiment.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:19]** Niko, badly beaten up, continues to fight, and the group seems to be put on the back foot until they make the discovery of the creature's weakness to different types of attacks.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** This is when Hears revealed a trick up his sleeve.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:28]** Utilizing his Electrovor, he was finally able to put this foe down.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:32]** A search of the room yields the discovery of a transmutating weapon.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:43]** However, the group is not out of danger yet, as they discover in the next room strange symbols, a computer console, and a strange creature controlling it all.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** What have our heroes stumbled into now?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save!

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** This is your final courtesy notice before I close out your file.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** Can I get your information?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** Have I told you guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** I am not a murder bot, but I will murder you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** Sir, I have your name here as Rick Murderbot19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Is that you?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Incorrect.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** Is that who I'm speaking with?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** My name is Rick, not a Murderbot19.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Not a Murderbot.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** And I'm not interested in extended warranties.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Goodbye.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** You need an extended warranty on Rick.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Not a Murderbot19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** You need an extended warranty on Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Yeah, that's why I'm calling.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:37]** I'm calling about Rick because I feel like something's going to happen.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Long time ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** He's having some issues, so maybe he should go for that extended warranty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** He is having some issues.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Welcome to episode 35, everybody.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:48]** There it is.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** I was waiting for that excitement to come through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** Guess the rains are down in Africa today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** This is fantastic.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** Classic We'll Save Intro where we start and then we say some other stuff and then we finally get on a topic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Are we on a topic now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** We haven't gotten on to the third phase.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** That's the third phase.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** We'll Save Intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** We can go back to the recording stuff.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:39]** the robocalls the ones that like they they're they're robots that are like um programmed to respond to you those are the ones that i hate the most when they're like hi blah blah and you're like no thank you and they're like oh i understand that but and he's like wait you're a you're a robot talking to me like i know you're a robot and they're like no sir i'm not a robot he's like i know you're a robot and i i finally figured out like the proper way to figure out whether they're a robot or

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:45]** If you ask them questions that they can't answer, like, can you tell me today's date?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Most robots don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** Interesting.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** If you ask them for their hobbies, do they answer with something?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I've never gotten that around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** What is the price of eggs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** What do you do in your free time, sir?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:03]** Oh, I play basketball and soccer.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** I totally dunk on everyone.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** I'm so badass.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** But I'm working on my VRM.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** We should play sometime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Nick, you're the sales guy.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** Do you have any automated sales call systems?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** No, I don't.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:24]** I have to do in-person cold calling, so everything I do is in-person, unless I'm the walking bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Sounds like you need to automate yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** Let's just close.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** No, nothing automated.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** I am in the process of building some automated emails, but no, no automated.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Will they reply back to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:47]** If the email replies back and says, like, I think you're a robot, you'll have an automatic reply saying, no, sir, I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** You can do that.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Oh, no, no, no.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** But you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** Yeah, I think we should set up an AI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Will and Kelly should set up some AI.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** I've built email marketing automation software.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** I'll set up your little Nick automation, Nick robot.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** I've also made a bot.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** We need to extend Barnabas.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Is Barnabas the name of... Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** Do you want to explain who Barnabas is, Will?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** We'll introduce Barnabas to the world at a later date.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:23]** We should totally make a bot for Orion Industries for Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Yeah.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Sorry, say it again, Nick.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** We should totally do a bot for Discord called Orion Industries.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** We should do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** It's just the secretary for Orion Industries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** I have a question, though.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** Let's just jump on a separate topic for about five minutes.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** Today, I went to a Foster's Freeze.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** Raise your hand if you've been to a Foster's Freeze.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Just me.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** All right.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** Oh, Will.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I appreciate that.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I feel like it's the California version of Dairy Queen.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Oh, Kelly, too.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** I have been, actually.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** Yeah, I usually hit them on the road.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** Is that the ice cream face?

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** Yeah, it's like the ice cream cone is their thing.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** That was delicious.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Just going to throw that out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:10]** Unpopular opinions, I don't like ice cream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** Okay, you're a murder bot.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** That was the final straw to figure out whether you were a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** That's the turning test.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Robots don't like ice cream.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:25]** Not even if you don't have any particular flavor that's kind of acceptable for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:31]** I mean, I will eat ice cream on occasion, but if I had the choice, I wouldn't order it.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Kevin, what's today's date?

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Chocolate chip cookies.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** Today's date is... I have to look that up.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** That's not fair.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** It's the 28th.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** Kevin is anti-ice cream.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** You guys ready to play?

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** You guys ready to jump in?

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** I feel like we're just stalling to jump in.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Let's just jump in and make the use of our time here.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** I thought about this the other week.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** I was like, hang on.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** This is important.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Have you guys been keeping track of ammo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** Yeah?

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** Yep.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** Yes-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** Not really a concern for me.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** I'm really... Actually, I'm almost low.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Almost low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Okay.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:10]** I'm confused on where I'm at because I had a problem with Hero Lab where I tried to, like, add a battery and then it added, like...

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:40]** too many batteries and then i tried to delete them and so i don't exactly know how many batteries i had but i know it was like plenty because we ran into like we picked up like yeah we picked up a bunch of extra stuff so that's true rick's fine because that's all every weapon he has right now uses batteries so i have like magical energy is my ammunition and it's doing all right it's always low oh in terms of how many spells you've cast yeah exactly oh nico what about you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:48]** I've gone through one battery pack, but seeing as we found a bunch of them, I'm literally at the same as where I started the beginning of the mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:53]** Is it really the case that for all the energy weapons, you just have the same battery?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** I think so, yeah.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** I would know because my characters don't last very long.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** So I can't really... I don't really burn through one battery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Please correct us if we were wrong about that.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:09]** But I'm pretty sure there's just some issues about certain types of batteries.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** But we haven't run across any of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:17]** I'm sure there's some that require some special energy or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Yeah, probably.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Probably.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:24]** Well, it's important to keep track because just saying, as I'm like...

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:30]** As we're starting to really sink our teeth into book two, which I feel like we have now officially tooken.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** Taken.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** That's a new word.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Taken.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Tooken.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** Now that we've tooken the chomp out of book two, you guys are starting to chew it.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** I don't know how far I want to go with this analogy.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Chomp?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** But now that you've chomped into book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** You tooken the chomp.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** You were just butchering this time.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** You know what?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** Some would say I'm nailing it.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Maybe Huel would say that.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Maybe Huel would say that.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** Look, this is... Well, you took in the chop.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Well, you took in the chop.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** That's amazing.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** That's a choppy avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Look, this is a dangerous place.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** I'm just going to reiterate that in general to all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** The Huel Hauser jokes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** The Huel Hauser jokes.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** We're in dangerous territory on this podcast.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:20]** No, where you are, these rooms that you've been in, and what comes next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** This is a strange place.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** That's strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** You are not wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** That's the best.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** That's the best.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** It's so appropriate for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** It's so appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** That's a great eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** Yeah.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Avocado.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** But maybe later.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** But maybe later.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:57]** So last episode, you all emerged victorious from a fight with some sort of half-formed, experimental, almost lethal troll creature called a troll polyp.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:07]** Created in part, as you found out, to make severed troll limbs transform into more trolls.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Not quite successful.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:16]** So instead it's this gooey substance type creature that almost kills Niko.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:28]** And then you all discover something else that is shape-changing, amorphous, this time the weapon called the Living Transmutation Matrix.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:46]** So as you handle it, it appears to resemble a vapor cavitation pistol and then quickly transforms into a knife as you're holding and then transforms back into a pistol.

**[00:10:46 - 00:11:15]** the spoils of your fight with the troll polyp you also discover some more amorphous blobs non-living now however that are in these wrecked large test tubes two of them totally not sure what they are one of them has the face of the shock broadcaster crush casbah odd

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** You all leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** Sorry, is Crush Casbah still alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** As far as you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** So you leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Nothing.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** I was just going to make a comment about Crush Casbah.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Please.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Stopped listening to him some time ago.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** It wasn't a joke.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** It's just like a matter of fact that he just doesn't listen to him anymore.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** He finds him kind of obnoxious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** After he left the Free Captains, he was like, no more.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Yeah, he was very popular among Free Captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Oh, of course.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Naturally.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** I would expect nothing less.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** So you head next door, cautiously open the door.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** And you see a whirlwind of activity.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:09]** Six bright red lights throughout the room, clearly beaming information in large, swirling cylinders.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** It's like projecting this information.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:16]** I'm moving you guys over to the map.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:29]** And in the cylinders, turning slowly, are numbers, calculations, arrays, data structures, moving, swapping places.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:36]** And you all just can't help but feel enamored with all this that is going on.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** This is probably the most activity that you've seen in one room.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:45]** The rest of these rooms are all nearly destroyed, if not totally destroyed.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Debris everywhere.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Room is crumbling.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** So in this one place where there's a lot going on, of course...

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** You see that in the center of the room, there is a podium, a circular podium.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** And there are these screens.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:05]** Think of like Minority Report where these projected holographic screens would come up, slide over, expand.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:10]** And they're surrounding some sort of small figure.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** That's standing there.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** You can't quite see because the screens are moving each time you try and look.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:18]** Also, you're still drawn to the red light.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** There's one directly in front of you.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:24]** The room, probably 60 by 20 feet.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** And you guys are on the long end.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** There's a door right in front of you.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:36]** And you see to the very far across the room, you can see past the streaming information red light.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** Looks like there's another...

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:41]** Sort of a double airlock door across the way.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** This is all happening.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** The door has opened.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** And what do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** So you said there was a creature controlling the screens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:55]** There is a small figure standing in the center of the podium.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Can I do a perception check?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** And you can't quite make out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Yeah.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:04]** Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:13]** 13 on the die for a perception.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** 19 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** 19.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:22]** I would say that you're trying to get perception on what?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** That creature thingy?

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Can I get?

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:32]** Likely, judging from the height, when certain screens move, you can kind of see, look through.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** You're like, I think that's a gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Rick opens fire.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Okay.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Yeah, I mean, it's up to you.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** I don't even have my gun out.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** The creature does not, like, nothing has changed.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:50]** The creature is apparently still looking at the screens, interpreting what's going on.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Data's still moving all across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:52 - 00:15:00]** So Rick is going to glance back at the others and then just, like, point to his eyes and then point in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** Do we want to try to be diplomatic?


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** Well, Rick, are you saying that out loud?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Whispering to you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** I think so.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** I will try to sneak in and take point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:14]** Fair enough.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Should I go in after?

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** Or should we go in after?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** If you'd like to take the diplomatic approach, I would suggest approaching out the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:33]** Nico conspicuously just kind of goes behind Rick19 here and just kind of is crouching down.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:37]** He's not saying anything, but he's... Stealth is not my forte.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Mine neither.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** Rick kind of smiles at you.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** But...

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** So yours is?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** No, no, not mine.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Oh, slime is.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:56]** So while that conversation is happening, Rick swaps out his great axe for his artillery laser.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** And he is going to trip and fall into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Were you rolling a stealth check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Yep.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** And I got a two with a minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** I know exactly what happens.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:21]** You step in, and I'm going to need you to roll a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Oh, will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Will save.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** I've never seen a dog eat avocados before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:46]** you see a dog in the corner eating avocados should we just refer to will saves as avocado saves avocado saves one question though is this a mind affecting whatever spell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Mind affecting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:56]** Because I'm constructed, so I get a plus two to saves against disease, mind affecting, poison, and sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** I don't think it's mind affecting.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** I don't think it is.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** I'll tell you what happens.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:08]** As you walk in, you think that you are ready to go.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** You feel like stealth is on your side.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:13]** Clearly, this creature has not noticed the door opening.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:30]** But as you step in, something about suddenly being inside the same room where all this information is swirling around overloads your retinal senses, and it feels like you are just getting overflooded with information.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Yeah.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** So this is a save against being dazzled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** DC 12.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Nice.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** You passed it.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:49]** So as you step in, you do stumble a little bit because you weren't expecting all of that information to just hit you.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** And as you do, you step forward a little bit.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:59]** Maybe your arm kind of reaches into where the projection of all the information is and your foot hits against it.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:07]** And when that happens, all the information that's in the thing right in front of you, the projector, just like stops.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:35]** nothing happens yet does anybody else do anything Nico's kind of just peering around the corner just kind of watching Rick progress to the door but he isn't going in yet so the projection you're saying there's like I'm talking about the map there are six different beams of information yeah and I walked into the first one because it's overlapping the first five foot square


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Yeah.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** And because you were trying to stealth, you didn't quite get it.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** I'm just I'm just rolling that into you.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** But that that turned off as I touched it.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** The light didn't turn off, but all the information there is constantly like moving and jumping and stuff.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:52]** And as soon as you interrupted it, it all just like froze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** So I'm just going to glance back at Dr. Okay behind me.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** Okay.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:03]** And I'm going to tell him, be careful of this beam here.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:12]** And then Rick is going to slowly walk over along the wall to behind the podium.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:17]** So as you take, maybe you start moving right about there, right where you are now.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:31]** It's at that point that as you get through, you can see that this creature, this gray, has a deep blue hue to their skin.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:38]** They're wearing this faded green skin suit with gold adornments on.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** all along the sleeves and the legs.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:48]** And you didn't hear it, but the podium, the screens moved.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:55]** And now this creature is staring at you and looks like this.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** I just shared it and I hope it shared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** All right.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** So he's a bluish gray with a green skin suit, as you say.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:07]** And his gun has like ice on the, it's like an ice carbine or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Good eyes.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** He's a bluish gray.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** That's kind of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** He's bluish gray.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** His right hand has some energy in it as well.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** It looks like Iron Man's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Yeah.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** He's probably got some kind of skin.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** He looks interesting.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** He looks innocent, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Here's what happens next.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** Dr.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** O.K., you're standing in the doorway.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Rick, you're standing right there.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** Nico, you're just visible.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** This creature is looking.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** Its face just looks blank.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** These black eyes just slowly move.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** into somewhat concerned, somewhat angry.

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:15]** And Rick, and I would say Dr. Okay, in your heads, you feel this presence impress itself upon your brain as if making itself aware of you and then to you, kind of like a lighthouse that just stops rotating and the entire light is blaring right in your eyes like it found you.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:24]** That's how you feel as this single, neutral, emotionless voice enters your mind.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** And you just hear resonating in your skull.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** I did not request any subjects.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** Why have you approached me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Rick is kind of just frozen.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** He doesn't know what to do or say.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** He's almost pretending like he can't be seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** You're wasting my time.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Answer me.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** What is the purpose here?

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** What is the purpose here?

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** How interesting that you subjects are so... Did I say you could interrupt me?


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:14]** These aliens are like the worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** These Grays have a bit of a reputation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** I'm not impressed with their personalities or what they do.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Just interrupt.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** They're jerks.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Anyway, continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** Dr. O'Kay and Rick, probably actually Dr. O'Kay and maybe Nico, because you can see this happening, Nico.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** I can't hear what they're saying.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Yeah, you can't hear it because it's all in their mind.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:41]** Give me a wisdom check, Dr. O'Kay and Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Okay.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Okay.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** 17.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:49]** Okay, Nico, you're the only person.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:57]** Maybe it's still an afterproduct of the way that you connected with the interface back in the previous central room.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** You start reviewing information.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:28]** and rick i didn't have you make this role because you weren't going through any of the information there you were moving rubble this word keeps coming up over and over in your head nico and i'm going to tell you the word and then we're going to go back to what happens next this word xtomi xtomi xtomi it's like your brain is scanning files you're like starting to pull disparate parts of your brain together much like the information in this room it's putting it together


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Okay, Xtiami.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** And Rick and Dr.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** O.K., you hear in your heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:46]** My purpose here is of no concern to you, but knowing what I do here, that should be your only thought.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:58]** Some say I am too connected to my work, but that is the only way to get outcomes that I deserve.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:04]** Do you know what happens to corrupted data here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** It's extinguished, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** Surgically removed.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** You are correct, subject.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** You are correct.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:20]** So what are your aims, then, good sir?

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** It is repurposed.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:27]** Given your close affiliation with your subjects, I imagine.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** I am a doctor, as you quite guessed, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** How peculiar you are, subject.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** How peculiar.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:45]** Then you must know that bodies are corrupted by muscle memory, reflexes, flesh.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:52]** The only way to unleash your potential is to unleash your mind.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** And I've seen many minds.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** Some like yours.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Some like his.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** You can tell that referring to Rick.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** I see all the data in here.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:13]** No one, no mind is immune to fear or doubt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:39]** nico is going to look over at dr okay while he does this and he's gonna with his eyes gesture dr okay to go into the room and then he'll look over at here's and with his with his gun and just kind of crouch down low he's going to try to indicate to here's just with hand signals just to kind of sneak in and see if we can't find a way to get around the gray rick make a perception check and dr okay do you move to the room


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:40 - 00:26:01]** um oh my god i'm rolling terrible tonight um i got a 10 for perception that's for the plus six 10 okay maybe dr k you just feel frozen where you are because the voice keeps going the voice says it is irrelevant


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Your pathetic existence.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** You're here.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:13]** I shall find a use for you and your data.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** That is all that you are.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Your permanent place here is with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** And with that, Nico and Dr.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:31]** O.K., something about the light almost like in your mind, the voice almost kind of gives you a nudge to look up.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:35]** So even though you didn't quite see it at first, you realize that...

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:51]** The red light of information that is above, that is projecting information down, you look up and maybe you couldn't hear it before, but each light is coming out of a brain that is connected to the ceiling.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:59]** It's as if the brain is like focusing information down into these projectors, sorting it, moving it around.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Like it's an organic brain?

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Like an organic brain.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** They are all different.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** They're all different species.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** So I give you a choice.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** Either rest now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** I'm having like deja vu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:50]** commit yourself to the repurposing to becoming the data that you are or make your final lucid moments full of fear and doubt and you don't want that you are fatigued let someone else take care of your mind I prefer the holistic approach thank you very much


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:56]** He's just kind of looking at everyone here and he senses that something's going on, but he has no idea.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** So he just kind of holds his hand up and then he starts to talk into everyone's minds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** And he's like, hey, guys, what's going on?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** Everyone's just standing around.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** What's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Can we reply back to you with telepathy?

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** Yeah.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:19]** I have no idea what to make from this and I'm stuck in this room unless... Why you can't move?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** Are you saying this or thinking this?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** No, he's saying this.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** He's saying telepathy through telepathic, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yeah.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** If you're speaking back to.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** So he's just like, I just I just don't know what to do.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:41]** And then like without having any kind of thought, Rick kind of just like reaches his hand out towards the next beam of information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:59]** could we do but dr okay yeah what did you say dr okay you said no right uh that i wanted i'm not sure what i'm saying no to being a part of some combining of bullshit experiments brain experiment


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Yes.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Say no.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:19]** The choice is to just submit now and just let yourself be repurposed and your brain be used for information or fight and realize that it's futile and be afraid of your non-existence that awaits you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Apparently this grade knows nothing about this crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:29]** Can I do a bluff check and be like, yes, I'll certainly fork over my brain to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** That sounds amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Well, we know he's not the mastermind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Is that what you want to do?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Yes.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Okay.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Roll a bluff check and what do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Of course.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** That sounds fascinating.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** Where do we sign up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** Dr. K, as you step into the room, give me a wool safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:50 - 00:30:00]** I was going to hit myself with a biohack, but maybe... If you do it before you enter the room, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** But when you step into the room, you've got to roll.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** That's fine.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Wool safe.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** As soon as you say something, you said, right?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** Like you said, guys, what's going on?

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Right?

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:15]** As soon as you said that, you felt this light come on to you.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** This light in your brain.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Dr. K, what did you roll?

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Rolled a 20.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** You're fine as well.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** You step in, but you've been looking at it long enough that your eyes have adjusted.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:34]** You feel this light come on to you, and there's a voice in your head that says, Someone who can communicate like me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Your mind is exceptional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Ah, now it makes sense.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:43 - 00:31:03]** the others your friends yeah yes what's up differently abled yeah but you and i can uh you and i can talk uh you know bug to gray so what's going on here they have committed themselves to the repurposing do you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** Is that that creepy brain thing where all the brains are clubbed around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:12]** I just wish to inspect your medical wares, of course.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** Brain surgery is always an interest of mine.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** You mouth is subject, but peculiar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** I have not said anything yet.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Just his hands just kind of clinging on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** I'm confused.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** I think this is all being said to here is telepathically, correct, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Yes.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:33]** But then now it's being said to all three of you.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** As he says, you are mouthy subjects.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Because Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** was thinking.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** You guys don't know who's thinking at what time.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** was thinking.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Hears was thinking.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** Rick, as soon as you stick your hand out, the information stops.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** The information in the other one kept going as soon as you moved out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Come in.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** This is to Hears.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** Come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Wait, question.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:02]** So the will save doesn't happen unless your body is in it or your brain is in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** No, the will save happens when you step into the room.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** It doesn't have anything to do with the projection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I thought it was because the light was hitting.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Come into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:37]** briefly like pretty cool here's is a computer specialist he knows all about data structures etc so could he make he is this stuff yes i didn't know that yeah computers is his biggest thing one you would need to come in the room to find out computer nerds and two i don't know that you would be able to just from seeing your information fly across the room i don't know that you can like put it together

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:41]** Once your brain is part of the projector, absolutely, that's not a problem.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** Once I give up my soul.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** So where is this gray in the room, by the way?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Oh, apologies.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** I did not show you.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** In the center of the podium, may reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** That's not... Not going to do that.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** So not going in if that's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:06]** So once the gray is no longer looking at Rick, he's focused on the others now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:11]** Uh, he's still looking at you, but the mind is like looking, it's looking at Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Then it's looking at here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** It's almost like Rick's like disconnected.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** He's, he's like his hands in the light.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:22]** And then he's going to like step into the light and kind of just look up at this, this brain.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** He's just like almost in awe of what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** The mind, a slice of the light comes to you.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Yes.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:34]** See, this will make the transfer much easier.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:39]** Were these brains willing subjects?

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Are you coming in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:56]** Now, before we, maybe this is interesting, but I might be game, but I want to know, those escape pods that you have here, we just came from a place, like a ship.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Do you know anything about that?

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:04]** Was that like a simulation or were you in charge of that ship that we were on before we came here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:15]** How interesting that your substandard minds are so easily ruled by this desire for questioning and survival.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** So peculiar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** You must be a great conversationalist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:28]** It is irrelevant why others have kept up and use your pathetic existence.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** Irrelevant.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Are you coming in or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:54]** rick's gonna roll perception to see if he can get a closer look at the podium oh uh 17 this time yeah it looks like it's a circular metal disc at the bottom that uh looks like it could be on something that twists and moves but the console itself is also connected to it and the and it's projecting screens and can i see anything on those screens

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:07]** You can just see like it's almost like data is being pulled in from some of the projectors onto the screen and it's like it's Some of it is moving very quickly as if being reviewed and running programs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** Some of it's just sitting there You know clear indications though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:16]** Well, I do You do speak at glow but no clear you you can't quite make it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** Is that the language of the grays I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:25]** It's the language, the most common language that you've seen spoken to you yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** That wasn't my question, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** That is the answer that you're going to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:38]** It seems that you are willing, but maybe you need some more convincing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** What's on this far wall?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Just out of curiosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** That's where the double door is.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Yeah.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:50]** you all sense this presence in your brain just grow malevolent.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Oh, fuck.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** We don't have time for this anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Is that me too, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:54 - 00:36:03]** No, because you haven't said anything or done anything, and I'm presuming that you are not easily... Because the hallway is not well lit at all.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** The light inside here is just shining out like a beam, and so if you're not in that beam, it's tough to see you.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:13]** But here spoke, so it found here's, and now it's getting angry.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Okay, all right.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** And they would like to attack.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** You need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Ah, damn it!

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** Natural 20.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Natural 20.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Let's go in order here.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** 21.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** I got to get my Don John up.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** Best initiative tracker on the planet.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Anybody 20 or over?

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** I know that was some person.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** That was one of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** 20, natural 20, 21 on the day.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Okay, 21 total.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** 21 total.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** Sorry, my initiative's plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** You got a 21 on the die?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Impressive.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Dude, that's awesome that you got a 21 on the die.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** That is really impressive.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** What is your dexterity modifier, Will?

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Plus one.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Plus one.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Roll a d20.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** You rolled a 20 for yours, too?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** 16.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Rough.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** 18 for Rick.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** 18.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Okay.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** Nico and Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** I'm rolling an initiative even though I was outside the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Yeah.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** You're still in combat order.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** All right.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:36]** Still moving in the initiative order here.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Here's his 10.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Here's his 10.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Nico?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** 14.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** 14.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** Nice roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Okay.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Hey, sorry.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Before this goes any further, I have a question.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** What if the players are all like, yeah, totally, we'll do this.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Is that just like the end of the game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** No, I mean, that's fine.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Would we just become brains on a wall?

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Or on a ceiling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:00]** The creature got a little annoyed that you didn't come in.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** He doesn't know how to talk to people.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** He has no care for you at all.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** And he just wants your brain.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** And you did not comply.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Surprise, surprise.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** Surprise, surprise.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:19]** Now, if you had said that you wanted to roll with it, Rick, then that's fine.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** Something still needs to happen in order for you guys to lose your heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:28]** But I just meant, like, what if the four of us are just like, oh, yeah, no, I totally want to be a brain.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** And we go through that process, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** That's fine.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** End of the adventure.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** End of book two.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** But will we know then, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Will we know because we're part of the machine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:42]** Then, then, and only then might you know what's going on.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:43]** Cool.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:54]** So, Rick, the first thing that you notice as you're looking up at the brain, you're closest to the podium, you're looking at the podium in the center, and you see his hands reach over.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:09]** And the door that you were looking at, Dr. OK, you see and you see some like levers move of like as if it is now locked, as if something has done something to lock the door.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Which door?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** The airlock, the double airlock door across the room.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Oh, this one.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Yes.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** He has done something to lock that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** And that is his turn.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** No, that is his move action.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Thanks.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Appreciate that.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:29]** Actually, he is going to look at...

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** uh, Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:40]** And as soon as like the screens move and now suddenly these black eyes are looking bright at you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:46]** And you feel like the full light of, uh, his, his presence impressing itself on you.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:57]** And you need to make a will save as you feel this presence, like pushing on you almost like pushing down on your body as if trying to keep you in place.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Oh my God.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** 19.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Dang.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Dude, that is awesome.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:17]** As you feel that something, I don't know what it is in your brain, but you're able to push that off and it was trying to cast hold person on you to keep you in place.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:23]** This thing is not messing around and it wants your brain.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** This thing means for blood


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:35]** I don't know if I can get out of this without causing some harm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** Well, okay.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Destroy it.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** Yeah.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** That was an easy decision.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** You hate this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** That was an easy decision for you.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** So what are these red sphere things?

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Information.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Information projector.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** And above them are the brains.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** But, like, I can't pass through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:01]** No, because it's, like, there is something in the bottom that's, like, helping to project and kind of contain stuff.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:06]** But, like, for mechanic purposes, you can't walk through it, but you can walk around it.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** You can walk around that screen.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Okay.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Could I do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** He just walked along the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** Well, for the listeners, you should also tell me what it is that you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:23]** Yeah, so I just want to... So I had entered the room and gone close to the far wall.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** Opposite the door?

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Yeah, opposite the door.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:35]** And so I moved around 20 feet close to the console wall.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** I suppose, like, there's some sort of cover situation, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Yeah.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:48]** If you're, like, where the console is, the console does provide cover to the gray.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Got it.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** But not to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Yep.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** So what are you going to do?

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Can I continue moving?

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:02]** Like, where does... Can I actually... I'll do, like, an engineering check on this console.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Roll a computer's check.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Can I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Yeah.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Roll a computer's check.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** 14.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** You are very... I'll tell you pretty much everything.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** You're really close.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:25]** You're pretty sure this is some sort of a data foundry where all these metrics and logarithms are used to help analyze the data.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:31]** And it's clear that this podium is some sort of center place where a lot of things come in slash it controls stuff.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:37]** Data or calculations can be sent out into any of these holographic displays.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:44]** So what you're seeing are calculations being run and test results being looked at.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** And then they're being ported back into the center podium.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** What...

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:58]** If you were to roll a little higher next turn or to put some more time into it, maybe you can intuit how this connects to the rest of the rooms that you've seen so far.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** But that's what you can find out right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** Got it.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:05]** And there's no way I can take cover behind this console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:10]** If you wanted to take cover behind the console, that would provide cover.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:17]** I mean, you're technically, you can't move into a space where the console is.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** So Rick could move into the spaces right behind it, right?

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** But as I said, Rick, you notice that this thing is on some sort of platform that can spin.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:32]** So you could be in a position where if you're standing in one of those four squares, it could move into that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** You're saying when he moves, the platform moves with him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:41]** he can possibly move the platform itself.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** The platform can rotate.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Dr. K, what are you thinking about doing?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** You moved, what, 20 feet?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** No, I think it was 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** 15?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Okay.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** I think my turn's done.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** I'll just try and take cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Okay, so you're standing behind the thing.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:01]** I mean, you can also delay or ready an action, too, if you want.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** Yeah, I'll ready my costa jet.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Ready your costa jet.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Okay.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** Costa jet is readied.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Costa jet liquidator is readied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Can I just keep, like...

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** If there's a shot, if this platform moves, like, shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:26]** Yeah, so you're basically saying if the platform moves away and you have a direct line to the creature, you want to take your turn and shoot.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:49]** yeah yeah as as long as it's not are we in melee range then uh i don't think that you're in melee range where you are now because it like you wouldn't what i'm picturing it is that the console is right at the center at the intersection of these four squares but you can still stand like if you were standing in one of the four squares you would be within melee range so you're not currently no got it

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** Yeah, it is Nico's turn.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** What do you want to do?

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** You're standing outside the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:59]** Nico's going to try and sneak in the room and is going to try to use stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:05]** That might be hard, but since the creature has not seen you at all, I'm going to give that to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** That's a 27 on the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** That is a 27 on the roll.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** That is an incredible roll.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** I'm going to roll and see.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Yeah.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** You do seem to move in.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:27]** It doesn't seem to notice you, or at least the lighthouse has not made itself known to you upon your brain.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Where do you move into?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:31]** And also, you need to roll a will save as you step in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** My will save doesn't count from the previous one?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** Or no, that was a different thing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** You didn't roll a will save because you didn't go in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** Okay.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** As you step in, where are you stepping to?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** So I've snuck into the room, and I've gone maybe...

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:54]** I've gone 20 feet to the back right portion of the room with the door on the north side of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Okay.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:21]** As you step in, you do blink your eyes, and you are able to make it across the room, but because of the overstimulation of all that information, you are dazzled, and you take a minus one penalty to attack rolls and to perception checks, and let's see...

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:38]** it lasts for i'm just gonna say i'm just gonna say it it lasts for one round so for uh until like your next turn you're gonna take a minus one to all of your attacks and to perception checks all right do you want to do it do you want to do anything else with your turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:42]** No, I'm still hidden to the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** Right, the creature is not aware of your presence at the moment.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** Rick19, what would you like to do?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:54]** You're standing in front of this creature directly in its targets.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Isn't it my turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Didn't you roll a 10?

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Oh, I thought that I was after Nick.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** My bad.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** I misremembered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** I have Rick19 at a 12, and here you're at a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** No, I said 18.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** My bad.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** How did you get 12?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** You were at 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** Yeah.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** Oh, well, then you were supposed to go before Nico.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** My apologies.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** I almost said something, but I just kept it to myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Why did you say something?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Say it.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Go ahead.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** I thought maybe I just misheard things.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** No, it's okay.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** Apparently you misheard things.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** It sounds like I did.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** My apologies.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Go.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Okay.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Well, so this thing's on a platform, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Yeah.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:36]** The platform is maybe a couple inches off the ground, but it does seem like, you know, it's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Okay.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** There is a skill called, not a skill.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** What is it called?

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** A combat maneuver.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** A combat maneuver.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Combat maneuvers.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Called reposition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Reposition.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Yes.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:59]** And it says that you can change a target's position to a different location still within your reach and within five feet of the original placement.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:05]** You can move your target an additional five feet for every five over your KC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** To standard action.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** Okay, so I can... Rick is going to drop his artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** He's going to step five feet forward.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Okay.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:24]** And since this alien thing is focused on Dr. Okay, he's just going to kind of grab it by the shoulders and try to move it off the platform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Try to pull it off the platform.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Okay.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** So you step up within there.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** You reach up.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** It's going to be a couple things.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:37]** You want to roll the KC plus eight, right, to see if you, like, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:37 - 00:49:00]** yes is it my case kac plus eight right it's your kac kac plus eight yeah okay give me your eye my i get a may it's a melee or combat maneuver so i get a plus four to that because it comes from i think strength or something acrobatics oh my dex probably goes into it uh okay come on why nine that did not work

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Nine plus four is a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** Yeah, no, you are well off.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:09]** As soon as you step in, it doesn't even try and move.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** It just grabs your shoulders.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:21]** Well, like you just step in, but maybe you misjudge it and like you reach out and it doesn't even move because it knows that you are not a threat as you reach in to grab it.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** So that was your move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** That's my whole turn.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Rough.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Stinking turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** Rough.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** Well, you are now at 18.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** Here's what you want to do on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:36]** I was trying to look it up, but if I do a skill check, does that take away?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** I can't do a full action after I do a skill check?

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** Or can I do a skill check and a full action at the same time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** We've talked about this.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** I think it depends on what the skill is.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Life science.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Life science.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** I'd say that you can do a life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** That's fine.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** All right.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:54]** So here's the life science and it's a 29.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** He just wants to detect any weaknesses in this gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** Weaknesses in the gray.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Let's see.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:13]** It doesn't have any like weaknesses where, you know, it's like certainly like it takes double damage to a certain type of damage.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:24]** I will tell you one thing that it's important to know are that you realize maybe as it was moving, you're not in the room per se, but you can see a little bit.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:32]** It seems like the creature can phase out of the material plane if it wants to, and then phase back in.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Okay, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:41]** And so what that looks like... This thing can teleport outside of here and lock us in and open that airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** Well, it can't teleport.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** What it can do is phase.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:49]** So what that means is that you guys are going to have a missed chance on any attacks or effects that target it directly.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** So if you were able to grab it...

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:59]** If you were able to grab him, there is a chance that he might have phased out and you would not be able to grab it.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:09]** Mechanically, this does look like it's a 20% mischance on attacks and effects and half damage from area effects.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** But if it's a force effect, right?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:16]** Like if it were like a kinetic force or something like that, that functions totally normally, right?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:20]** And it does seem like it can move through things if it wants to.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:27]** So that's what you get with your 29, which again, this is you having heard of grays, like from legend.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:40]** And now, and now you've up to now, you've only seen dead grays and you know that they're cruel and you've seen their handiwork, but now you, you are in combat with one who literally just wanted to steal your brain.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** So you're like, you're just putting things together.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** You're like, Holy shit.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Uh, there's a lot here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:53]** All right, he tells the group this, and he's like, so I kind of noticed that this thing can phase in and out or something.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** I don't know, but you might have trouble hitting him.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Heads up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** And then he rolls, he takes full action for a magic missile.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Yeah, full magic missile.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** All right, so three or four plus three.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** No nerf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** Full action for Magic Missile?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Yes.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Dang.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:16]** So that's 3d4 plus 3.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** Is Magic Missile a force effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** I don't know.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Yeah, it is, actually.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** So there's no disadvantage, right?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** That totally goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** That is awesome.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Unless it's a force effect.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** He amended his previous form to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** He rolled a 12.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Damage.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:44]** You hear the voice come into your brain and be like, I'm a fan of footnotes.

**[00:52:44 - 00:53:13]** uh how much damage 12 12 12 damage wow as he sings careen in and probably move right past rook 19 and yeah they hit this gray and you see his bluish skin starts to turn black and charred where on this like very you know small skinny chest it just totally covered the chest with marks that was that was some good damage nice

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:17]** With that, it is the top of round two.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:37]** Rick, standing right in front of this gray, and this gray has just been hit, you feel its presence turn towards you and just lay into this voice with all these layers just saying, like, you are outside your proper parameters, subject.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:44]** And you see the hand, the same hand that locked the door, press something else.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:59]** And you need to roll a reflex save as the console begins to just rotate and move over into your space, trying to knock you over.

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** That's a nine.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** That is a nine.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Ooh, it's DC 10.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:07]** As just you were not expecting it, this console swings out.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:13]** And Dr. K, I think it's still in front of it.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:19]** So I'm going to say there is still cover there unless it moved all the way or else your ready to action would be triggered.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** Yeah.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Is that fair?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** You're saying that this rotated like 45?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** It rotated.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** It was facing the southern wall.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** It takes up two squares.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** It's a semicircle.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** It rotated 90 degrees to hit Rick 19.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:36]** Because I would say that it still has cover.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Fire.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Fire.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:54]** Before we get to your turn, real quick, Rick19, this thing swings around and hits you, and you take two points of bludgeoning damage, and you are knocked prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Yeah.

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:05]** Yeah, you are knocked prone, and I kind of want to – there's no ruling on where you go, but the console is now, like, in your square.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Okay.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** And I don't know that you would be there.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** So I kind of want to roll a D6 and see which square you get pushed into.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Yeah.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Okay.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:17]** So one, two to the left, uh, three, four diagonally away from you.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Five, six right behind you.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** That's a six.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:29]** So you get pushed back five feet as, as, and you fall prone into the square that you were in before as this console hits you dealing two points of damage.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** Um, and that was just, it's move action, uh,

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:42]** As you fall to the ground, it is going to, let's see, what does it want to do?

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** Dr. K, you are behind the console, right?

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** Yeah, at this moment, I'm right here.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:55]** Okay, I think what it's going to do is it's going to reach down, and Dr.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:06]** O.K., you see it reaches underneath the console, and then it pulls out the gun that you guys saw it holding, this gun with this rifle with this frosty stuff at the end of it.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:11]** And that is its turn, and it is now Dr.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** O.K.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** 's turn.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Well then...

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** I guess I'm going to try and walk up.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:24]** I have my syringe spear also equipped.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:31]** And I'm just going to try and pop him one with my last remaining biohack.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** But I'm going to combine it with my spark of ingenuity.

**[00:56:36 - 00:57:00]** nice okay so what does that do allows me to um combine the effects of two biohacks into one damn okay i think i want to deliver so this phasing what would you call it it's like it's uh what would i it's it's called phase the ability is called phase is it a damage resistance


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** No, it's not a damage resistance.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** It's like a concealment.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** It's a missed chance.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:09]** Yeah, there's a chance with any attack or effect might just go through it.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:15]** So I'm going to, you know, I'm betting all I got because it's my last one.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Okay.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:23]** I'm going to combine the basic inhibitor and give a minus two to AC.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Okay.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Okay.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:33]** As well as a, do I go for the, do I go for the pharmacological one or do I go through the, just the minor?

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** I think the minor is worse.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** This is intense.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** Yeah.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:41]** So I'm going to go with the minor inhibitor and the basic inhibitor.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** So it's basically... Minus two to AC.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:50]** Minus two to AC, and then a minus one penalty to attack rolls for seven rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** For seven rounds.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Okay, give me that roll.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Nice.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** Yeah, that is good.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** If this hits, this is going to help you guys out.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** Natural effing 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Yeah.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Gross.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** All right.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:16]** So you also need to go ahead and roll a D100 and get above a 20.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** The odds are in your favor.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** The odds are in your favor.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Could this help?

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Could this help?

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** You said above a 20?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Get above a 20.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** 87.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** 87.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** You're good to go.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** There we go.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:34]** That cost a jet goes through and hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:39]** This was from the tactical syringe spear.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Goes through the syringe spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Brilliant.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** Make a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** Make a fortitude save.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** Don't you ever ask me to do that again.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** That is going to be a 19.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** But you're still entangled.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** Entangled.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** Or, I'm sorry, encumbered.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:00]** Encumbered.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** Minus five penalties to strength and dex.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:07]** This thing's super buff, so that's really going to rough it.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:30]** encumbered here dang so it like moves through probably courses through whatever veins this gray has and starts to slow it down as you see some of the movement slow it down i like it and then what there was damage right from from a crit yeah oh that's really good that's super good because that's 11.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Wow.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** What?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Yes.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Damn.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Nicely done.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Okay.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** So it comes through.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:47]** You probably see these veins that you couldn't see before because the skin on this thing is like... It's kind of like my jacket right now.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** It's just very smooth.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** It's unblemished.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** You can't see any musculature.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:58]** And then as it goes through, you can see this serum starting to run through the veins of the creature.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** That is a bad...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:27]** ass move you want to do anything else with your move um i guess i would do that uh computers check again if i can yeah sure yeah sure i imagine that i just like catch the gray with like the tip of the spear under the chin real quick yeah and just get them in that get them cold and then i like glance over at the uh at the screens what what do you roll uh 26 26


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** 26.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Yeah, well done.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:49]** It seems like you probably put together that from what he was saying and from the information that you found in the other room, that the results of the room that you were in with the troll polyp and the other rooms that are here that you've seen those tests, all those tests are coming into this room.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** That's where it seems like all the data is feeding into.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** Yeah.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Rick19, it is your turn.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Did you move yourself back five feet?

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** My Roll20 didn't update.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** You pushed me back and then you said I was prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** You're prone and you're pushed back five feet because you're in the same square as the console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Which direction did you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Right back towards the north wall.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:11]** So you walked forward, you moved right back, you pushed back into the square that you were in.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** That's rude.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** That's what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** Well, okay, so the grain is actually like in the middle of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** It's at the intersection on this podium.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:25]** So how does that work with like range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:32]** Right now, if you were to shoot a range thing right now, I mean, it's still, I'm going to say it's like five feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Yeah.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** And it would have cover from this console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:40]** Well, then from prone.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Oh, he's got cover though, right?

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Is that partial cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** He's got cover.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** From where you are and especially being prone, I'm going to say it's full cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:51]** But, okay, I'm prone, but I can move while prone, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** I think so.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Let's look it up.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** I think you can only move like five feet while you're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:05]** Well, as long as I can move, I can also draw a weapon because it's my bonus moves, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:12]** Minus four penalty to melee rolls, plus four to armor class against ranged attacks, but minus four penalty against melee attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** That's awesome.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** It doesn't say anything about moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:18]** I feel like you can't move your full speed, though, because you're prone.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** But to stand up from prone is move action, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** I know.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** So here's the issue.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** If I stand up, I drop my weapon.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** So if I stand up, I can't attack.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** But... Wait, hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** But... But... Dang it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** You put me in a weird predicament.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** Dude, this is all... That's this guy's jam.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** Welcome to combat with a gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** I was trying to get creative with combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** Weird predicament time over and over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:53]** So if I can move, I'm also allowed to draw a weapon because I have a bonus of plus one.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Right?

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Okay.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:58]** So if he... So Rick is going to crawl... Five feet?

**[01:02:59 - 01:02:59]** Just five?

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** You're limiting me to five feet or is it like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:06]** I feel like maybe in six seconds, how far can you crawl?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** My son can crawl across the house in six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** So 15 feet?

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** Half your speed?

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:15]** 100 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:22]** I'm telling you, my son can go from the living room to the kitchen in like two seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Is your son an android?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:25]** Is your son a gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:44]** is that what you're saying no and technically crawling is like his most proficient form of movement so i don't know he's he took the crawler class okay yeah he can phase in and out of the kitchen counter he can phase yeah that's how that's no we put we put we put locks on it so he can't do that

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:47]** Okay, so Rick is going to move.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** He's going to crawl five feet.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** That gives him a clear shot of the gray then, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** As he crawls, he's going to yank over his giant laser rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** I can see you start pushing yourself with your feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:13]** With this giant laser cannon on his shoulder from a prone position, he's going to lay sideways and put his head on it like a pillow and shoot this gray...

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:36]** um with his gun okay give me a shot bam so that's a plus eight to hit because i don't lose for ranged attacks you don't lose anything while prone ridiculous makes perfect sniper but damn it uh 13 i'm gonna throw this dice away 13 he's got a minus remember he's got a um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:40]** I thought that he passed the fortitude save to his AC.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** No, he always has that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** Minus five dex, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:51]** The fortitude save was only for the uncovered condition, but he still has the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]** So he's not encumbered, but he does have the minus two to AC because he passed the fortitude save.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:01]** And so what did him passing the fortitude save save him from being encumbered?

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** The entangled condition.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Oh, being entangled.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** So he does have the minus two.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:09]** So he's slow to move out of the way as that shot hits him, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:11]** Oh, yes.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:12]** It hits him?

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** It hits.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:16]** With the minus two, you hit.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:20]** Under move actions, it does say you can crawl five feet as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** Okay, so five feet.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** So that's so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** But it doesn't say anything about me drawing my weapon.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** So I'm drawing my weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:32]** Well, so actually, to be fair, let's play that back.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** What?

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:38]** You can crawl five feet as a move action if you want to draw your weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** As a part of a move magic, I can draw a weapon, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:42 - 01:06:06]** john he took the grace and feet last level he can crawl 100 that's right that's right he's got the grace and feet he's killing it grace and feet okay so that is uh now i gotta look at weapons that's a d10 damn it's my d10 i just remembered something yeah okay so he does have a minus two penalty but he's not i we're gonna have to retcon this okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:25]** uh i think earlier i said only the minor inhibitor and the basic inhibitor right okay yeah so that doesn't trigger the uh it's just a minus two penalty to your ac plus a minus one on attack rolls


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** We just need the minus two, man.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** That's all I need to hit him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:31]** So there is a minus two, not encumbered, minus one to attack rolls.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** Yes.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Okay.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** Perfect.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** Okay.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** So I roll my D10.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Okay.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:42]** Seven points plus, I think it's three.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** So 10 points of damage.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** 10 points of damage.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** This thing looks- Lame prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Dang.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:53]** This thing looks like it is not in great shape as you hit it.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:54]** Wow.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:55]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** That turned out a lot better than I thought.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** I thought I wouldn't be able to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:01]** I thought you wouldn't be able to do anything either, but I think you did it right.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** I think you technically did it right.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** If I did it wrong.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** Nico, what are you thinking?

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:09]** Wait, isn't it here's his turn?

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** No, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** No, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** He's got a 14.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** All right, cool.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** All right.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:20]** So Nico is going to sneak over again behind.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** He's going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Where to?

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:29]** He's going to go here to just over behind Dr.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** O.K.,

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:32]** Okay, so he's going to step over behind Dr. Okay.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:35]** Yeah, he's going to sneak over there, so I got to roll a stealth roll.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:40]** So that's, yeah, that's 23 on the roll there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Okay, all right.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:51]** I'm going to say that as soon as you move in to where he is in that line of sight, I feel like he's going to notice you because you're standing right behind Dr. Okay.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** Okay.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:57]** I feel like there's not a way to stealth right where you are now and not, cause he's like looking at Rick and Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:58]** Yeah.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:01]** So he's so, so you are now in his radar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Yep.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** And so you moved over there.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:06]** What else do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:10]** He's just gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna pull out his pistol.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:11]** Okay.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** And, and he's gonna point it at the alien.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:14]** Okay.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:14]** That's it.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:15]** No, no attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** No attack.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** Okay.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** Come over, pull, point out the pistol.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Here's what are you doing out in the hallway?


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** You guys are starting to surround this gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Yeah, good.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** He was just going to hit him with a magic missile again.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** He wants to end this.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** So full action.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** And I'll roll again.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:33]** Okay.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** Roll again.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** Let's do it.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** 12 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** 12 damage.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Okay.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** It hits it in the back.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:47]** It looks like it is very close to death.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Good.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** Charred on the back.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Charred on the front.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]** Shoulders been hit from Rick.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** Minus two.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** Moving a little slowly.

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:58]** Feeling woozy.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** And it is the top.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn, Harris?

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:03]** No.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** Okay.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:05]** Okay.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]** It's the top around three.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:21]** All of you, especially you now, Nico, now that you are in its awareness, you all feel this like scream where it's like succumb to my will, like resonating in your brain.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:29]** Give me a reflex save as this console comes swerving back to hit you.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:33]** Natural one.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** Natural one.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:53]** As maybe you were focused on Nico or this voice in your head, and this thing comes around and hits you for three points of damage, you are knocked prone, and I'm going to roll the same one, two, three to see where you go, probably into one of the three squares by you.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:58]** I'll say either the one directly to your left,

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:26]** is one two corner is three four towards rick is going to be uh five six that is a five so you get pushed five feet towards yeah towards rick and as you do this hand comes down you are prone this hand comes down that glowing hand that you see comes down to attack you because you are prone you're going to have a minus four

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:31]** to your AC from this attack, from this melee attack.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:33]** This is with their minus one.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:37]** With a minus one, which is good because I rolled a crit.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:41]** So it is now a 19 and not a crit.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:42]** So well done.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:46]** I'm going to assume that that hits your AC.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:48]** That was a 25 total to hit.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:53]** And that is going to be... Wait, if you rolled a 20, you rolled 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** Yeah, I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:56]** Isn't that a hit no matter what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:06]** Yeah, but then with a minus one, I'm wondering, so then it would just be a hit, but then it's... Or is a crit a crit?


## Speaker_0

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:11]** I thought a crit was a crit regardless of the minus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:14]** Well, whatever.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:15]** I guess I'm dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** I mean, I guess I'm dead.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** I think you're at full health.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** Critical hits, page 245.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:23]** With the console, right?

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:24]** That was three points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:25]** That was three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** You hit regardless of your target's AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** How many points of damage does it do?

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:35]** Well, I'm trying to see whether it's a crit or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:39]** It says when you make a roll and you get a natural 20.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** I think it probably is.

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:42]** It has to clarify.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:44]** The D20 comes up 20.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:48]** You hit regardless of the target's AC.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:53]** If the total result of your attack meets or exceeds the target's EAC or KAC.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** So it hits.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:56]** You've also scored a critical hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Yeah.

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Okay.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** Okay.

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:01]** So it's a critical hit, which is fantastic.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:06]** Because, and I totally picture it, Dr. K, you were like moving in, you're moving in, you're like confident, you're sure.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:09]** And then you just were not expecting the console to hit you.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:15]** And as it hits you, it comes through and knocks you prone.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:23]** This like Iron Man glowing gloved hand comes down and just touches onto your slug Osharu chest.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:27]** And you take nine points of damage and you are staggered.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:34]** as you feel this electricity course through the water that is in your body.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:38]** I don't know what percentage water Osharu's are.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** Like 99, 99, 99.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** 99.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:45]** So I love when the dice work out.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:51]** It makes sense that it crits you because it's electricity coursing through your body and you are staggered.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:55]** So you can take a single move action or a standard action each round, but not both.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** You can't take full actions.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** You can still take swift actions.

**[01:12:58 - 01:13:00]** That's fine.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Will this creature be alive?

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:01]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:04]** For future reference, this is talking about critical hits.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:07]** How do I add conditions?

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:18]** On a critical hit, if you hit a rolled natural 20, but you are below the AC of the target, which is probably not going to happen for several levels because we're still pretty low.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:22]** But if it's below the AC...

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:24]** If your total hit is below AC.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:29]** So like if his AC was 20, then your critical hit would have just been a normal attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:31]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:33]** But so this, it was a critical attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:33]** Got it.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:34]** Okay.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:34]** Okay.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:35]** Got it.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:36]** Makes sense.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:37]** That was its turn.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:40]** You're prone on the ground, staggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:41 - 01:14:11]** what do you do uh i'm going to i can only move away i suppose i can't you can only move or attack yeah uh i i suppose i can only take a guarded step too right because otherwise i get an attack of opportunity that's true yeah give an ao yep so i'm gonna the old ao trick guarded step and there's a free action be like oh i'm not feeling so hot guys


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:15]** And then can I do a swift action?

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:21]** You can take swift actions, but you can't take reactions is my understanding of staggered.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** What is your swift action?

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** I can do a swift action.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** You can do a swift action.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:27]** So move action and swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:30]** I'm going to slime.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** That took a lot out of me, guys.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** I don't feel so hot.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:40]** And then... Understandable.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:43]** So I can hit up to four.

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:45]** I just rolled a 1d4.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:52]** I'm using the slime Osharu granted option from the Alien Archive 2.

**[01:14:53 - 01:15:01]** This is swift action, and Osharu can excrete slime into an empty adjacent square.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** Ooh!

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:05]** Causing that square to become difficult terrain.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:09]** So that's what I'm going to do too.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:10]** Which square?

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** The square that you were in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:13]** That I was in, yeah.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:14]** Yeah.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:15]** Okay.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:15]** Love it.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:16]** Love it.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:17]** Okay.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:23]** So you cast, you shoot some slime into it, into this difficult terrain.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:24]** It is Rick 19th's turn.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:25]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** Oh, Rick's still laying on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:28]** Rick's still laying on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:35]** This beam of information is hitting him, but he's got a clear shot.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:40]** So he is debating whether or not he should just go full action and shoot twice.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:49]** So I have a plus eight on my attack, but it's a minus four to do a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:50]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** Double shot.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:57]** But if I fire twice, I get a plus four for each.

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:59]** What?

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** Oh, no, it's a minus.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:01]** Oh, I see how it's here.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** So it's a minus four to my plus eight.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** So I get a plus four still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** Got it.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Makes sense.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** So two attacks at plus four is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** So I'm going to do it.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** Why not?

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:15]** So he's just laying on the ground.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:19]** First shot is an 18 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:21]** Yeah, that hits.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:22]** Roll a D100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:25]** Oh, I didn't do D100s?

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:26]** I didn't do a D100 last time.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:51]** i thought you did i did not oh this is important we should uh well i did roll d100 before when when kelly was talking about or somebody else was talking about i got a 96 so we'll just use that and call it good okay thanks um that was a 76 that's fine for yeah okay so so 76 yep do you want to roll another one for last time

**[01:16:52 - 01:17:08]** sure why not okay so the last time was oh it's 100 okay so 76 and 100 so i hit both times yeah wonderful and i'm actually cheating i'm using the digital because i i didn't want to have to do the battle of what a d100 actually is on here

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:09]** It's so fun.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:13]** It's my favorite set of rolling.

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:14]** We'll talk about that offline.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]** That's my d10.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:21]** It's a 5 plus 3 is 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:24]** 8 points of damage.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:27]** Had 8 HP left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** Oh, I wasted my turn then.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:31]** I could have just run on one shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** Rick shoots again.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:33]** Ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:49]** As it falls, falls back, it falls back, head hits the console, and as it happens, I would say Nico and Dr. OK.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:17:51 - 01:18:02]** You see this gray matter, like, explode from the back of its head onto the console, and as it does, each of the consoles go...

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:12]** And so all four consoles, like, power down, and the back of this thing's head explodes from, again, some sort of cortex thing in its head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]** Oh, so Rick didn't kill it.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:15]** It died some other way.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:16]** I'm just going to point that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:17]** No, you killed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:18]** You killed it.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:19]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:19]** I shot him.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:21]** You brought it to zero hit points.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:22]** And then his head exploded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** Rick, what are you trying to do?

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:25]** Rick, it fell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:32]** You killed it, and when it reached zero hit points, the back of the head exploded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:37]** Rick is like, I'm not a murderer, but I swear, I only shot the second time after he was already dead.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:40]** I only shot twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:43]** You were like, I didn't even shoot the second time.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:43]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:45]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:48]** And with that, that's our game.

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** Good job, guys.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** Now Rick just feels bad.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:56]** He's looking at the gun in his hand and he's like, oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:56 - 01:19:01]** I like how we argued about whether you were a murder bot at the very end and we didn't just end it right away.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:03]** Great game, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:09]** What an episode.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:12]** Okay, so now we have a better idea of what's going on around here.

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:18]** These aliens, these greys, they've abducted us and they want to use our brains to make supercomputers.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:20]** That's crazy.

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:24]** But I think we have a good chance of getting out of this because that alien went down pretty easy.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:27]** And now I just want to reiterate, Rick's not a murder bot.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:31]** Like he did take that last shot, but he did it in self-defense or defense of others.

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:37]** And then that Gray's brain exploded, just like the other three that we found.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** So these things are rigged to blow up to get caught.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:42]** And I'm sure that's not the weirdest thing we're going to see.

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:46]** So I hope you like what you're hearing and I hope you stick around.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:48]** But I do have one request from you.

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:54]** Go on to Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts from and give us a rating.

**[01:19:54 - 01:19:58]** Put that five stars up there and tell the world how great we are.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:03]** And also tell your friends and just spread the word if you enjoy listening to us.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:05]** I'm sure you do if you've gotten this far.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** Thanks for listening.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:12]** We really do appreciate having a fan base out there that loves what we do because we love doing it.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:14]** We'll see you next week.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:15]** Kevin, out.


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:21]** Thank you.
