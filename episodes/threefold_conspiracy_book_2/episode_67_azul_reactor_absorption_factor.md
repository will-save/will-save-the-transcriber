**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously, on We'll Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:25]** The big bad boss battle continues with the barbarous Bicipital Beast bashing our heroes to their breaking points, with our hero's ally Hrog receiving the brunt of the troll's barbarism, where an early exchange of critical hits between them both results in the behemoth birthing a bilious brood in the form of a familiar foe, a polyp that can pack a true wallop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:37]** The doctor, with the help of hears, failed to shut down the reactor, but Bernice the briefcase makes haste to briefly break the cycle of radiation, flooding the chamber, harming our heroes, and healing the troll.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:55]** Colin, in a bold move, seeks to bait the troll and further heal our band of brothers Bodacious Bruiser Frog, but in the end, the bizarre brawler from Akaton can't burden the battering from the two-headed beast falling dead at the hands of the troll's brazen brutality.

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:00]** Will our beleaguered band of brigands be able to bear this brush with death?

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:06]** Or are they about to find out that breaking through this baleful battle is beyond hope?

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:10]** Find out this time on We'll Save.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast, episode 67.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** I'm John Swan, your Game Master, and I'm sad.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Yeah, we're all sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Why are you sad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Sad moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** You know why he's sad.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** I know.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** I'm sad too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** I think we're all a little sad.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** That was a hard hit.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Yeah.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:27]** Frog, our beloved Akeshdi Rivner friend, has perished.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Gone too soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Gone too soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** He was a good Akishti.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** This was the hardest death for me.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** For sure.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** I really liked Harag a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** I think Bernice did too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** I wish they were fast friends.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I kind of want to go back.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Sorry, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** I cut you off.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** It's fine.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:48]** It's a morning session.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** He was like a solid.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** He was a solid part of the team.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** I agree.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** He was like a full-blown member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:07]** I was saying earlier before we started that I kind of wish he was around just so that John would have to play him for the rest of the game.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** As like a member forever of our team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** 20 episodes later, he's still like making the voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:18]** It just has like John's sad hinge.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** Cockney Australian.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** He's like exhausted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** So what does Frog say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:27]** Um... Just kill me.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** I'm tired of playing Hrog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I'm tired of playing Hrog.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** No, it's fine.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** You know, it's funny that you mentioned Bernice.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:40]** I actually... I kind of want to know what happened when Bernice and Hrog were just hanging out.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:49]** I think when you all were finding Colin, I kind of want to zoom in on that conversation, so I'm going to log that away for a future...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:49 - 00:04:18]** memory is just what is the conversation that yeah like what's the what's the flashback that allowed them to become friends i think like bernice was enamored by like frog's pure brutality in the uh room with the core box you know like that's true she was just like sort of a bystander to it uh staring up at frog from her like diminutive stance right like she's like only a foot tall maybe so it's true

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:41]** there's this giant like you know 15 square foot or 15 square feet whatever square feet he's just like a rock's huge man that's true are you saying bernice has a type he's large personality for he just likes to watch like violence happen she's just fascinated by like

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Giant, violent creatures.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** She's kind of, like, new and starry-eyed.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:50]** To be fair, like, Hrag had a good personality to, like, go along with the violence, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:55]** It's not like... It wasn't just... Because, like, a Rivener... Matter of fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Riveners, in general, are just completely violent.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** They have no control, no self-awareness.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** They're just violent.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:09]** And I think it's very... That's one of the key things that we're supposed to pick up on is Hrag, as an Akashti...

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** was not a Rivener.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:19]** And he was actually probably very small, because Akestis are actually small creatures, not large, gigantic.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:28]** And so the fact that we saw Harag in this state of being a Rivener, but still had the mentality of a regular Akesti... Yeah, which... ...is a big thing.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** It's what the Greys were doing.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:35]** They were trying to get some kind of conscious control of that power that a Rivener has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:40]** Dr. K found that out looking at Frog's cells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** He was really unique.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** He was one of a kind, truly.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** For that reason, among others.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** Well, RIP, Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** I will miss you for sure.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** I was trying to understand.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]** I was trying to think through the moments from Frog's perspective.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:05]** What was going through his mind and how he found people

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** That didn't want to fight him or hurt him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:18]** Like, from the beginning of that fight, you all were like... Like, how that might have affected his mentality and, like... Yeah, like, his... What's that like for him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yeah.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:25]** He spent his whole life either in a gladiatorial ring or being experimented on by aliens.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** And, like, we were the first group to show him kindness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:32]** I'm sure we'll talk about it more in the plot armor episode, but there was definitely a chance that we could have just fought him.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Definitely.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:39]** Someone would have probably died during that fight because I think he hit me for like... 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** 15 points, yeah.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:45]** He grabbed a chunk of rock and just like overhand...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** MLB Major League pitched it at you.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** This was smart.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** We're choosing our battles, which is good.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** That's true.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:57]** Think if we had to fight all these things, we would have been pretty tired by now.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Like, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:05]** Harak still reminds me of the Death Claws from Fallout 2.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** You could befriend one of the Death Claws and he walks around in just a coat.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** As soon as a fight breaks out, the coat falls to the ground and it's just this Death Claw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** It's great.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:20]** I was thinking that you all gave him an opportunity.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** You said, like, this is your chance to renew your glory days.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** This is your chance to be someone else.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** To be the Keshti

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:39]** He once was, you know, and I was thinking that like in round three, when he when he swings both arms, he deals his like massive amounts of damage.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** And then Colin, you heal him.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** You like E.T.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:47]** phone home, heal him right after that, right?

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** Because he had already been hurt a lot.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** And I was thinking that must've been a moment for him.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:58]** Cause in like, maybe there's probably a chance that somebody went and helped him out in the gladiator ring for sure.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:08]** But now after, after all the trauma that he's gone through for somebody to risk their life, when Colin, you've had the troll polyp on your tail.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:13]** And then also I think you had an AOL from both the troll and the troll polyp.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** And so then you were like, I'm still going to go heal you.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Right.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** And Hrog knows that he's like pulling focus on the troll.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:26]** He knows that he or the Dr. Okay are doing something that he probably doesn't quite know or care about with the computer.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:31]** And so that moment, he knew that he probably had friends too.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I think that solidified it because he knew it before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** Part of something that was bigger than himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Yes, yes, yes, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** I think Hrog went in a great way.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:46]** He died doing what he liked to do and also getting revenge on this troll and also having friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:46 - 00:09:09]** it's good yeah yeah he yeah and kevin i think you the the way that you described it too like the anime ending right because as he is like about to go up and and and attack again because he gets hit for the first arm and then it's the second arm of that of that mall that that really took him out but then he's like he smiles at colin and then

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:14]** As he charges forward, his face is in shock and his eyes are bulging and blood comes out.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:20]** But then he has that satisfied smile as he dies fighting in the arms of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** But this combat isn't over yet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Combat isn't over.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** So we can't let him die in vain.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Well, I think about what he said to you.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** He said, today we may die in case you forget.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** Keep your blade held high so tomorrow we may live.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** So this is your chance to live.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** He said that?

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Who said this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** When did he have the time to say that?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** We couldn't understand it because it was in Australian Cockney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** It was in Cockney, Australian.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:51]** I liken it to when British prisoners first came to Australia.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:54]** The accent was still very clearly there.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:59]** And I may draw the ire and some flack from people in Australia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:59 - 00:09:59]** I'm sorry.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** Australia, but it's hard to understand you.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** Sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** The only way we're impersonating them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Can I ask?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** Is that why you lost the emu war, by the way?

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** Because you couldn't understand each other to coordinate.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** Did you ever look that up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:17]** You have to give us a full breakdown of that war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** We should interview somebody who's Australian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** What year did that happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** It was like sometime in like the 50s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** It was like this century, this last century.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, this is like the last hundred years.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Oh, 1932.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** The Great Union War is in 1932.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** It's actually called that officially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** They had fully automatic weapons, too.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** They had full auto.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** It's too good.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:43]** It's not like... The emos did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:46]** The emos had fully automatic weapons.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** That's why they won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:55]** The wiki article of the Great Emu War is just like an Australian guy strangling the life out of a fucking emu.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** Probably at an incredible range because it's so hard to kill emus.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:08]** I just love that they lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** There was multiple attempts.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:16]** I don't know why we have Marvel movies when there should just be a whole series about the great emu wars.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:21]** It should be an animated series of emus fighting.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** It'd be like Con Wars.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** It'd be like an allegory for environmentalism and

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Well, it would just be like Clone Wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:33]** It would be like eight seasons where it's just literally like Australians versus emus.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Like they just find a different battle.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** And it's like, oh, this battle in this different area of Australia.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** And it's just going to be emus fighting Australians.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** And then like all of a sudden the emus have a bigger tank.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** And then the Australians have to like compete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** It would be like Attack on Titan.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** Like the emus are like 300 stories tall.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Just like kicking over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Yes.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** I don't even know what noise an emu makes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** They just laugh.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** They just laugh at you.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** Which makes it even worse.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Just laugh, like, derisively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** Can't believe they had automatic weapons and they still lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:15]** Because, like, apparently the emu, like, plumage is so f***ing huge and their actual body is so tiny that they were just shooting through the plumage.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** It's hard to hit, man.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** It's so hard to... That's what happened.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** It was crazy, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** That's crazy.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** That's smarter than me.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** We should have teamed up with an emu.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** We wouldn't have died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:29]** Why wasn't Hrog an emu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Why wasn't Hrog an emu?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** I think Paizo really missed out.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** Like punch him and then like Hrog would be like, guess again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** Flap a feather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Guess again.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Just like laugh.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:48]** Alright, well as we get started here, I encourage you all to think about what you were thinking.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Because we're going to come right in on that moment.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** I can only think about emu's and Australian's now.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** That's fine.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** And maybe you whisper to him, if only you were in the mood.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** Yeah, that's exactly.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Yeah.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:08]** So as Frog falls, both troll heads smile.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** As Frog slips off of its fingers.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:19]** And Steven begins to laugh like...

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:30]** While Blue, the other head, looks up and looks around at all of you and just angrily shouts like...

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:34]** And Colin, Frog's motionless body is in front of you.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I'm going to move you guys over to the map.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** We have a troll polyp right near you ready to attack.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** We have a troll who is angry.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:49]** And we have Dr. OK and Hears looking to solve what's going on with this reactor.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** I'm going to come in right on Hears.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** It is your turn.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** And what are you thinking?

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Here's his thinking to himself.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:01]** Did he already roll a computer's check on this computer?

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** He thinks out loud, hoping the GM will hear it.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** Did he?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** No.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** So the thing is that you already rolled the thing.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** You've been connected here for a while.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** I'm using my telepathy then.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Right.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:22]** So you're connected to the great comm unit, which allows Dr. OK to interface with the with the with the simultaneously do something, right?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:33]** Oh, so not simultaneously, but like here's you are essentially allowing him to gain control of the computer and go into it and look at the control module that is controlling the reactor itself.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:37]** And I will say, Kiers, that you are... I almost called you by a fake name, Kelly.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Yeah, who's that?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** I will say that you have to maintain the telepathic contacts to this Greycombs unit, right?

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Yeah, that shouldn't be an issue.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Okay, cool.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** I guess I'm just... Kiers, give me another quick... Yeah.

**[00:14:51 - 00:15:18]** computers check okay cool just a super yeah it's pretty easy dc 30 30 30 no because it's only here's here's you realize part of the reason why not not only do you have to maintain the telepathic contact uh to the greatest common device in order to help dr k access the computer right so we're looking at this whole architecture you also see because now you've been connected for a minute and you see buried in the higher architecture of the computer

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:32]** You can understand that if you didn't have this telepathic access, that if Dr. Okay were to just try and hack the computer and get in without it, that Dr. Okay would trigger a trap.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:38]** And so when that would happen, then Dr. Okay would be able to see what that is.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:44]** So it's like you have avoided that whole situation in which there was a trap for Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** I think right now I'm just trying to help Dr. OK.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:53]** So I'm just like helping maintain this connection and I can help him on any computers check CS coming up.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:58]** So I don't really know if I can do anything else.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** Do I still need to be at the computer?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Can I start attacking or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** It's still a full action for you to be able to hold it.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** So that way he can access it.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Yeah.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Do you see her?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** I'll go down.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Because you might not even be looking.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** No, I don't think I do.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** So, Hears and Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:18]** are at the consoles to the right of this octagonal room.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:24]** And I would imagine that you're facing ahead at the heavily shielded metal walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yeah.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:32]** So here's just going to say to Dr. OK, he's like, all right, I'm going to maintain my telepathic connection.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:36]** If you need help with this computer or anything, I can help you with that, too.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Yeah, we got to shut it down.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** All right.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** So.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** I'm ready whenever you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Okay.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** So Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:48]** Remember last time you were just getting into the computer, you missed it by one.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** You rolled a 24.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** It was DC 25 to access that module.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** And I'm just thinking that it's like you were suddenly into the computer once here's came in.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:03]** And it kind of makes sense narrative-wise that like you almost were able to access it, but you weren't quite able to.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** But you did see that there were three options.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:08]** But in order to enable one, you got to hit that DC 25.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Okay.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:15]** The three options were either shut the reactor down or shut it down and reboot.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:19]** Shut down the cleanse sequence and then one was to blow it up.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:30]** And then one was to set it to go back into the sanitation, go nuclear later within any period of 12 hours.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** So you could set it for an hour from now or 30 minutes or whatever.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** So it is your turn and you have these options in front of you.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** You're going to need to make another...

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Did we talk about this already?

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** About what you should do?

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:49]** You did talk about it a little bit, but it was a little bit from a metagame sense, but it was like a... Which one do you want to do?

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** I feel like you... Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** I think we're just going to shut it down.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** All right.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** I'm with you.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:05]** And then now can I use Bernice to assist in my computer's check using her?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** I guess it's only for certain checks.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** She has a skill module.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:19]** She has an internal database, 1d6 insight bonus to a skill when identifying a creature or recalling knowledge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** So it's not recall knowledge.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** Yeah, it's not identifying or that for a creature.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:25]** I think if Bernice can access the computer.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** She doesn't have a computer skill unit, though.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Yeah, so I think she could help you.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** And I think here's could also aid as well, right?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** In order to get that.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** So you could get a max of plus four.

**[00:18:36 - 00:19:01]** okay so bernice assists bernice assists what about uh here's i'm sure he does but just for good measure yeah yeah he assists okay so money big money it makes sense because here's you're doing a full action so you're kind of overlooking everything from this other interface which is kind of cool what'd you get dr okay i got a 17 on the die oh man plus 4 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** which is 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** 28 computers plus 4 is 32.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Plus 4 is 32.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:14]** That is more than enough because...

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** As you are able to press those buttons in the right order, I feel like it comes up.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** It's like several menus, and you're typing through.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** You're like, confirm, confirm, confirm.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Yes, click here.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Boom, boom, boom.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Are you sure you want to do this?

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Like, turn the ball to make sure that you're not a robot.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** But Bernice is a robot, so she would fail that test.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** And then as you type through everything.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Presumptuous.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** I mean, she's also a briefcase, so yeah.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** As you type through.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:49]** you do hear this low rumble.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:58]** As a little thing comes up and turns green and says, reactor successfully turned off.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Yes.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:05]** You have stopped the shutdown or the sanitation sequence of the reactor.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** Is it in, like, power down mode or, like, standby?

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** It is power down.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** It is in a standby mode.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** Power is presumably running on some sort of secondary generator backup.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Who knows what that is.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:22]** I'm just saying I would know if it was actually a reactor, not just green ooze and tubes.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** You'd what?

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:28]** I would know what the backup reactor or generator is if it wasn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** Kev would know, but Rick would not know.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** Yeah, Rick knows nothing about nuclear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Usually diesel generators.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Are the rods still glowing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** The rods...

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:48]** do continue to glow as they are, as I'm presuming, Kev, they would still have things like they are powering up.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** So they would probably be slowly becoming less illuminated.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:54]** I could also be using hand-wavy science fiction radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:01]** Well, I think the rods themselves are illuminated that they would be shrouded by something that would be in a shutdown sequence.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** Just to, you know, all those nuclear engineers out there in the world.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** Not that I know anything about it, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** I'm going to just say this is a very fictional setting.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** Absolutely.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** Not accurate to the real world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** Not completely accurate, but there are things about it.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Not completely.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Not completely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Fantasy.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Frog, yes.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** So, congratulations.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** You have done this, Dr. OK.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** And here's, you are standing at this computer.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** But we're still in danger.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** But you are still in danger.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** And we'll get to that when we get to the trolls.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Get to the ladder and get out of here.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** We're good.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:41]** That's a possibility, and it is the top of round five.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** It is Colin's turn, unless you want to do anything else, Dr. K or Bernice, because Bernice also has a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:58]** I'm going to... I think we established at some point that the floorboards were sort of pliable and allowed for cover and concealment.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Yes, you can get under them.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:14]** In that vein, Bernice and I are going to try to find some cover, and maybe we can quell this beast from beneath the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Okay.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** So if you want to go, tell me which grate you want to go to.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** You do have to make a DC 11 strength check, so I don't know if...

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** You might not be able to do that with your computer's check.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** No.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** But could Bernice at all do any sort of?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** She's a strength of six, so no.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** I mean, she could still hit DC 11 because all she's going to do is prop it up.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:42]** There's also crowbars next to the station that you're at that would allow you to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** That's convenient.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Yeah, that's very convenient.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** I told you guys about this when we first did it.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** You could do a plus two.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Okay, gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:49]** I have a question.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:55]** What is this device-looking thing to the right of the council they're looking at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** That is the gray comm unit that Hears is telepathically connected to.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Yeah, so it's on the right side of the room.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Left side of the room is the door to the reactor.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Colin's in the middle.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** Next to the ladder well, Rick is in the southeast corner.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:15]** And the troll and the trollpollop are at the north and west parts of the room, respectively.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Trollop.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Trollop.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Why didn't they go with Trollope?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** That's really a missed opportunity.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** So what does Bernice want to do?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** Does she want to use the... Can she grab a crowbar?

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Yeah, I would presume so.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** It would just be really awkward.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Okay.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:34]** What's the... Grabbing an item is... A standard action?

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Move action.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Well, did... Question, though.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Was she, like, locked into helping me?

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** She was aiding you, and I don't think...

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:49]** Yeah, I think she could still do it because here's technically aided you as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:57]** I'll argue that picking up an item like a crowbar as a tool would be a move action because it's like a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** But to use it would be a standard action, I'm pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** So I think Bernice could use it.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:07]** And I think Bernice could use it if you want.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** Okay.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Well, Bernice is going to do that.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:17]** Give me a strength check, Bernice, and you get a plus two to your strength check.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Nailed it.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** 18 on the die.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** 18 on the die.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** For 16.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Okay.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** And which grate are you going to pull up?

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** The one adjacent to Bernice and Rick.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Got it.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Got it.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Got it.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Got it.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** So you pull that up.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:39]** What that's going to do is, one, there's a small crawl space you can get into.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** And I'm going to assume that you prop it up.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:55]** And when you prop it up with a crowbar, that will actually give you improved cover against attacks from the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:01]** I just want to rules law a little bit here to manipulate an item is moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:09]** This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object or opening a door.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** So I'd argue that picking up the crowbar is one action.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Yeah.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:16]** Lifting the plate is another action, another move action.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** So it's two move actions, but you're using a standard as a move action in that situation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Question.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Yeah.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** So you're saying it provides cover this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:30]** Like we're basically like cantilevering the, the great panel.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:34]** I actually was thinking that you would cantilever it towards Rick or towards the front.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Right.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** So you can pull it up.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Yeah.

**[00:25:36 - 00:26:04]** which is fine and i think in general the troll is really big so i think in general if you're down there the troll really can't get you from a melee sense but if anything is thrown at you or if the troll polyp comes by who's smaller then you would have improved cover for for the listener this panel is in like the southeast of this octagon that we're in and the troll is over on the north end so like cantilevering it on the north end of this square is going to get them just a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** I don't know if I like the way you guys are using cantilever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** Yeah, it's not... Isn't that cantilever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** It's more like... It's like hinging it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Yeah, it's like a hinge.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:17]** Because I do picture that Bernice threw it onto the grate and then backs up.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** Sorry, mechanical engineer, architecture, design people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** I'm having flashbacks to structures and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:28]** It's not cantilever, per se, because it's not out on its own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** Is that a long projecting beam or girder fixed to one end?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:34]** Just calculate the sum of moments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** Just calculate the sum of moments at that point, and that's all you've got to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** The integral of the whatever.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** Thank you for coming, George.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** All right, so you've done this.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:51]** You've pulled this up, Bernice, like a tractor pulling the grate up.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** I love it.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** I love it.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** It is top of round five.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** It is Colin's turn.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** What are you going to do?

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:03]** Frog has just slumped against the ladder well in front of you and slid onto the ground.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:10]** You can see where the brand from the Corvox is on Frog's abdomen.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:15]** And you can see Frog's lifeless eyes are looking up at the ceiling past you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:23]** Colin, seeing his newly found colleague slumped on the ground, sheds a tear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Is this Colin's music?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** I'm here for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** I kind of like it.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** I'm down.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** I mean, this is the fight now.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** This is the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:42]** Colin's hurting, so he's going to burn another resolve point to Healing Channel himself for 4d8.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:42]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** Let's see if I can find 4d8s.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Here we go.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** I'm going to throw them.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** And we've got a 6, a 7, a 4.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** And a seven.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Wow.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** Nice.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** So that's 24 points.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Freaking Colin, man.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** What is he doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** He's healing himself.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** I thought this was an attack.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** I was like, holy shit.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** What was your HP?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** It was 16 HP, zero stamina.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Oh, wow.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Oh, wow.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Dang.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** That's dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:21]** Just for the fans to know that Vinny's competing with Will because he set up his own dice cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** It looks good.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** I'm quite chuffed by it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Wait, quick question.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Is our esteemed guest and colleague Dice Game here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** She's around.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** There she is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:40]** This is the non... She's a little embarrassed right now.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** She's not up to, you know...

**[00:28:42 - 00:29:01]** dice cam doesn't have like her full you know regalia set together so she's a little shy bashful but she's around well now we have our new guest dice tray dice basket dice basket i need to step up my dice retention game yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Cool.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** So now I have full hit points and 12 stamina points.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** I am also going to... What do I want to do?

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Oh, here we go.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:16]** I'm going to use a fun spell called Wisp Ally.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** Wisp Ally.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Okay.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:29]** Justiculates with his hands, and you see lights similar to Here's His Floating Fireworks spell that I forget what it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Dancing lights?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Dancing lights, thank you.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:35]** And those start dancing around and circling the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Let's see.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:42]** I draw forth otherworldly energy to create a small spherical floating wisp.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** And that can... I feel like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:50]** it would come out of your chest out of like staring race symbol, you know?

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Okay.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** This light.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** I love it.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:57]** It's up to you, but so he starts gesticulating with his hands and you see where the two wings come together.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** A glow of what appears to be sunlight at first.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:09]** And there's like a tiny sun that pops out and just appears to be heckling the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:13]** It's like the baby son from like... It's like Tinkerbell.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** It's called Teletubbies.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Teletubbies, yeah.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** He's just rising up and laughing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Bit from the original Tron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** The Wisp?

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:34]** The Wisp is made of pure light and energy and can't be damaged in combat, but it does provide either Herring Fire or Covering Fire.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** That's awesome.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** That's really great, actually.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** Herring Fire, Covering Fire is some important stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Keep going.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** I'm going to go with... Oh, man.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** I should have looked this up before.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** The difference between Herring Fire and Covering Fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:51]** Depends on if you want to give the enemy a penalty or give your ally a bonus or you a bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** I think it's a difference.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** I want to give my allies a bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Okay, so I think that is... I think that's Harrying Fire.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Let's look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:04]** Thumb through the Paizo Starfinder Core Real Book.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Core Rule Book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** The Core Real Book.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** It's just... Core Real Book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** It's full of Starfinder-themed jazz tunes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** It's just all jazz standards in the Starfinder universe.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Autumn Leaves on Castroville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** Yeah, so... Giant Troll Steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:26]** Yeah, the allies get a plus two circumstance bonus if you do harrying fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Yes.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Harrying fire is on page 247.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Is that what you're looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Yes, thank you.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** 247.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** I forgot 274.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:40]** You can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that distracts a foe in your line of effect.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** Make an attack roll against AC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** So it's already achieved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:54]** You deal no damage, and your next ally to attack the foe gains a plus two circumstance bonus on their next attack roll, as long as that attack occurs in their next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Then what was the other one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Cool.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** Covering fire is the same thing, but you get a plus two to your AC, basically.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Ah, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Got it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** So here's the real, a couple of benefits.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:07]** One, it sheds light in 20 feet.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** We're going to say it's a warm white, because I really like warm white.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Okay.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** And it's going to constantly provide... How many Kelvin are we talking about?

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:24]** And it's going to provide it for one round per level.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Four rounds.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** Four rounds.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Everybody gets plus two to all of their attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Okay, so I love it.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** Yeah.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** That's awesome.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Wait, a plus what?

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Plus one?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Plus two.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Plus two?

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Dang, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Sorry, is Harry Fire set to the next hour?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** It's only the next hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:47]** It says the next ally, but that's assuming that Herring Fire is a single action where this Wisp ally is constantly circling the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** That makes sense.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** What's the duration?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Four rounds.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** Four rounds.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Oh, rad.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** I was too busy putting a warm white light around the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** If Vinny's breaking rules, let us know.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:01]** Yeah, I'm going to count on you rules lawyers to keep me honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** This is cool.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** This is rad.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** A bright, shining light.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:13]** I can imagine the shadows flickering, like casting this huge shadow of this troll along all of you as it's moving around both heads.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** Cool spell, especially right from Sarenrae.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** Fantastic.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Herself.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Herself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:41]** herself amazing amazing i just want to clarify so um i know sorry it says provides either herring fire covering fire against an enemy each round and it follows the enemy uh within range automatically unless you direct it to change so i would say it only provides one of the other once per round


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Got it.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Okay.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** So the next attack against the troll has plus two.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Fantastic.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:51]** And then after my turn each round, it would reapply itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Yeah.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** So I think the troll sees this happening.

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:02]** At least one of the heads sees you and is just baffled trying to follow the wisp and look around and see what's going on.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** I love it.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** You want to say anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** What are you thinking?

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:14]** No, he's silent with rage and grief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:19]** Yeah, but you did probably notice the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:27]** Colin probably noticed the sudden dimming of the green vertical stacks to his left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** Yeah, and any shaking that was happening subsides.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:37]** It's finally still after so many days and hours of constant vibration.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** What are you doing?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Frog just died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:51]** I was curious about this, and I don't exactly know where to even look for it, but to message the stewards, is that a move action?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Is that a full action?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Is that a standard action?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Is that just a free action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** I think you're...

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** I'd say using your communicator devices, whatever that would be.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** So that would be a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** So it's a move action to manipulate an item?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I guess it would be manipulate, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Then I'm going to do that.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:11]** I'm going to, you know, he's got this artillery laser on one shoulder, and he's going to reach up and just tap his ear with the other one.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Shay, come in.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** This is Rick19.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** The reactor has been shut down, but we are still fighting a troll.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:22]** And then he's going to just focus, like put his hand back on his artillery laser and aim and take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** You're quiet for a second or it's quiet.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** And then you hear the doo doo as your thing connects via Bluetooth.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** So whatever you said didn't actually go through because I hadn't connected yet.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** So you got to say it again.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Just kidding.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** You're like, God dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:41]** I wasn't sure if you were telling me like my actual audio or something, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** All right.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Okay.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** So you send that and you got your laser.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Who were you shooting?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Colin or here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Say again?

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** The troll.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** I'm shooting the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** You're shooting the troll.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Yeah.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** What is John trying to do right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** So discord.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** Yeah.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** I think his dog's eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Talking about discord.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Join us on discord and let us know how everything's going.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Join us on discord.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Join us on discord.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** All right.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** I'm going to roll.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** So discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** TM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** I just threw my dice across the table.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Ah, 19 to hit.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** No, I'm sorry.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** 19 plus eight to hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** Dang.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Wow.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Yes, Vinny?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** You really had me in the first half there.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Did you add the plus 19 from harrying fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:28]** No, so 19 plus 10 for 29 to hit.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** 29 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:37]** That is going to be, unfortunately, a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:40]** Of course, yeah.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** I was bracing myself for a Kevin rant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:48]** I was like, what do you mean?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** So then that's going to be a D10 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** D10 plus four.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Amazing.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Wow.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Wow.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:04]** So two plus four for six points of damage.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Okay.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** All right.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** I'm glad you found that funny, John.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yeah.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** I'll tell you why later.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:21]** So you shoot and it hits and blows off Blue's head and just explodes.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** It's got more than one head.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:28]** Yeah, the troll reels for a second and Steven looks over at where Blue's head used to be.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** and just gets angry.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:34]** But it looks like it is on its very last legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Oh, man, I missed my one.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Is that what you're going to tell me?

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:42]** Very last legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Amazing.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** You blew off a troll's head.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** That's Rick's turn.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** That was Rick's turn.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Wow.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Wow.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Okay.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** All right.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Incredible.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:54]** Okay.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** It is going to be the Trollope's turn.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** And I saw that.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Trollope.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** I think the Trollope is pretty mindless.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** And I think it's going to go and attack.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:15]** Oh, you know... You know... Our favorite child of Sarenrae...

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** colon Eden brand.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** So it's going to move over.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** It is currently on the Western side of the room.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:39]** It's going to take a five foot step slide forward and maybe come up kind of behind you, Colin, because you were focusing on sending out this wisp of light and is going to do another slam.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:45]** You were entangled last time and I think you're still technically entangled, but you moved anyway.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** I'm going to roll these new crack and die to do a slam on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** It's a 16 against KAC.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** That's not enough, good sir.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** You need a 17 to hit Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:07]** It feels like the slam hits you in the chest as soon as the wisp of light comes out and then scratches off more paint of Sarenrae.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Probably pissing you off more.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** You spend a lot of time working on that, putting that on yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** You see the impact reverberate across his breastplate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** But Colin underneath is left unscathed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Right, but maybe the wind's knocked out of you.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** You're like, you're not expecting that at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** I feel like you probably expected it, though, after getting walloped the last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** And being entangled.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** That's true.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** That's true.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:41]** Okay, so this gooey, ooey mass of troll polyp goodness slams you in the chest, not doing enough damage.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** It's the quantum troll's turn.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:51]** I think the quantum troll, Stephen, looking at where Blue's head was.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Stephen was the one who laughed.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:03]** But then as soon as the radiation goes down, I think was when Stephen looks over at the door.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** And anger flashes.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:16]** And the quantum troll teleports right in front of the rods themselves.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:30]** and then begins to just smash at the rods, trying to rip them open, trying to get whatever is in there, get it out, get this radiation, get all that good nuclear material that's really good for your body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Yeah, he regenerates from this reactor, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:44]** I mean, you definitely saw that some of its wounds healed because of its regeneration.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:50]** For mechanical purposes, the Wisp ally follows him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Okay, love it.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** Yeah, I think the 20-foot circle right now is considered the light and considered that it's on there.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** This is the first round that it's on there, which is awesome.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** So it's going to begin attacking.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** It does hit, and you see some of the glass start to shatter.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:12]** But then he also looks back and turns and looks at the four of you, and that is going to be Steven's turn.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:39]** going to be it would have been frog's turn but frog has perished instead it is here's his turn rest in peace for us here's you as soon as the reactor went down you probably sensed a whole shift in the whole system itself right he can't get any power from the reactor anymore right he can't heal himself because it's sound right yeah i mean or is there some latent radiation yeah

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:47]** No, I mean, whatever radiation might be in there, he is trying to get in there, but is maybe just now realizing that he might not be able to.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Okay.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** That something has changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:53]** He's felt the decline of this radiation.

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:02]** He turns around, and he sees for the first time Hrog's dead body, and he's not quite sure if he's dead dead, but he's worried that he is.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** He's like, oh, no.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:08]** And he reaches into his bandolier and takes out

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:13]** this little figurine and tosses it near the polyp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** The Electrovor and the Pokemon music cues.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Electrovor!

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Oh, man, the music.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Your Pokemon.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Electric Boar comes out.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** I want to be the very best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Very best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** This is great.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** And then opens up, I'd say.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** Here's his aiming for this corner.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Jeez, let me see if I can point it out.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Here we go.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** He's right here.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Okay.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** Yeah.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Sorry.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** I got you.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** That's where electric work goes.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** I forgot how to ping.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** Those aren't pings.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** You're drawing circles.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** He just drew like four circles in the area he's trying to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** They're not even good circles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** All right.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** So that's where he goes.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** There he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** By the way, I just found out Electrovor can fly.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** What?

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** Yeah, he can fly.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** That's rad.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** It's pretty great.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** That's rad.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:20]** And Electrovor is going to, because he does not want to do an electrical discharge with Colin around, he's going to tail slap the polyp.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** The troll polyp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Electrovor, tail slap.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Tail slap.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** I like your lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:29]** I think you do need to make an AC five throw to land it on that square that you want to, right?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** It's just like a grenade to throw it and get it right where you want it to.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:37]** It's like a, I'm thinking of it like a, like a range weapon, which is typically AC five in order to hit the square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:40]** Is it plus five for everything past your, your throw range?

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** So like look at the throw range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Yeah.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Plus two.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** Star range should be fine, I think.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** I don't know who passes that check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Where does star range show up on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** It's 25 feet.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** I think it's 20 feet.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** So is it plus five?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Sounds right.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Okay.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** I pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Okay, cool.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** So you are able to throw it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Soars through the air.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:08]** We see the camera slowly moves in front of Rick19, who had just fired the excess from the guns coming up.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:15]** Colin is like, and the stone lands right next to the troll polyp.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Comes out.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Love it.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Tail slaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** What's your attack?

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Right.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** It says tail slap plus nine.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** So that means I add nine to my roll, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** All right, cool.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** Do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Oh, it's totally, it's a 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Actually, it's more than that.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** It's like a lot more than that.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** It's a lot.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** It hits, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:44]** Yeah, that absolutely hits because it just tried to hit Colin and was not paying attention to this Pokemon that's right next to it.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Poke creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Sorry, TM.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** So, four damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** I mean, it's like five damage.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Five damage.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Nice.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Nice.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Okay.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** Okay.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:03]** As it slaps and some of the goop falls onto the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:07]** Just to clarify, it's a D4, you rolled a 2 on roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** And I added 3 to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Okay, so it's 2 plus 3, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Nice, love it, love it, love it.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Awesome, awesome.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** He just kind of looks at Colin and he's like, who's this?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** And then just kind of like...

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** Yeah.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Readies himself again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** There you go.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** New person here at the party.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Love it.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Okay.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** So that's a movement action that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:33]** I think Hears is going to move himself.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** Oh, no, he can't move himself because that was a movement action.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** No, that's it for now.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Hears is going to remain invisible.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** There's probably an advantage to doing that.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** So he's not going to attack yet.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Otherwise.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Going to remain invisible.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Love it.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Okay.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Dr.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** O.K., it is your turn.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:52]** You and Bernice and Hears have successfully shut down the sanitation procedure.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** So Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:58]** is going to look over and, like, see Hrogs.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:26]** lifeless body looking up towards the yeah the ceiling and uh be like sort of mortified and uh fearful frankly and he's just going to be like it's going to be fight or flight so he's going to pull out the costa jet and then shoot and move to the great shoot and move to the great uh is pulling pulling out of weapons of free action i was gonna ask


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:30]** No, it's only a free action during moving.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:35]** It's a move action to draw a weapon unless you have a plus one to your bonus attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Which I think Dr. Okay does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** I'm not sure he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Really?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** For what?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:44]** You're a level four biohacker, level three biohacker, one mechanic.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** I think you do.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** I have a plus four to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Not a plus four to hit.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** It's on your bonus attack.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Your base attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** So it would just be in the character operations manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** Okay, I'm looking at Hero Lab, but I don't know where it's at in Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Yeah, it's right there.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** What page is that?

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** It's a character operations manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** Oh, I don't have a character operations manual on me currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:12]** Base attack bonus plus two for third level biohacker.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** There it is.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Coolio.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** So I'm going to shoot.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:21]** You're going to pull it out, shoot, and then shoot your gun, and then go in the oven.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Does an 11 work?

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** Against the troll?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** EAC?

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:56]** no guess no no it doesn't swings wildly because i'm sure you're like on the move and you're stepping down a platform and then you're also trying to move past the grate and then also stepping down into it makes perfect sense i'm flustered i'm looking at frog's dead corpse i'm like you're trying to aim past the ladder well yeah yeah and uh bernice is gonna attempt to give me some or give covering fire i think okay uh

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** And that would apply to whoever's next, right?

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:06]** Yeah, it's a plus two AC to whatever attack from the troll creature to whoever's next.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Yeah.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Okay.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** So she's going to do that.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** AC 15.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:14]** She also misses.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:17]** She also misses, so she doesn't provide any covering fire.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Yeah, she rolled a seven.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Rolled a seven.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** It seems like the troll is not really even paying attention.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** The troll is the one head left, Steven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** Fires off the vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** It bounces around.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Maybe you hear ricochets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Yeah, nothing.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Nothing goes up.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Nothing.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Ricochets.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** Let's ricochet down to the chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:46]** Are you who... That reminds me of a thing that Kelly and I know, but we shouldn't mention it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** Okay.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Good times.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** Dr. K, are you going to move down from where you are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Ricochet.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** I missed that last part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Oh, insider, insider jokes.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Yeah, insider jokes.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** That was a really recursive joke, in fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** That was a super recursive joke.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** Are you moving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Dr. K, right?

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, to the grate.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** I'm going to go down in the grate.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Okay, cool.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Okay, cool.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** You ready?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Cool.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Love it.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Love it.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Love it.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Love it.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Love it.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:17]** All these awesome moves that all make sense.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** This is fantastic.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** Top of round six.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** It's Colin's turn.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** What do you guys do when you shut down the reactor?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:34]** You got a troll Paul up and you got a troll who is angry that his source of nutrition and a balanced diet is fading away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** Uh, Colin's quite upset.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:49]** Um, he's, he's feeling triggered about, uh, some stuff that, uh, stay tuned to hear more about his backstory to figure out why he might be triggered.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Keep listening folks.

**[00:49:50 - 00:50:20]** uh you and uh he's gonna troll kill this family a he's gonna pick like one of the bolts because he needs something under five pounds yeah and use a cantrip level zero spell depending on uh which terminology you want to use called telekinetic projectile reaches out with his hand lifts the bolt chucks it at the troll oh wow wow okay okay okay

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:46]** uh let's see if he hits that is not a hit i'm i'm below 10 i'm not even gonna do that math okay and it pings off of one of the arms and just climbs to the ground yeah all i'm gonna say is that cantrip's not in the um the gloss glossary of the core rule book it would be otherwise sure

**[00:50:46 - 00:51:03]** it's a spell spells is anyway we can this would be a great debate for us to have in our discord uh tm um so let's yeah carl's just gonna hang out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** He's going to turn to the troll Paul up.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** Be like, hey, so, uh, can we rob him?

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Yeah.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** It's like bolt across the room.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** He's like, what's up?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Okay.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Yeah.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** What's good with you?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:26]** I feel like he gets a sense that this, this fight is reaching its end and just like to, to burn any bigger resources to bring it to an end would be wasteful.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Okay.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** That's, I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Yeah.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** John's like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** As John twists his mustache.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** Yeah.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Of course.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Of course it's coming to its end.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** It's a natural conclusion.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Top round six.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Can you end this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:48]** From where I'm standing, I still have a clear shot on the troll, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I think because the troll is large.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Yeah, I'd say so.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** Yeah, if it was right next to Colin, I'd say, well.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** It's straight line from corner to corner type thing, right?

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** That's true.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Yeah.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** And it's large, so it's like above Colin's height.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** So that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** All right, cool.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** Then I'm going to do a full round action and shoot twice.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Oh, this is what it could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** I don't know what I just said there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** I got a 15 plus 4 for a 19.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** And I get a plus 2 from the wisp, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** So I get 21 on the first shot.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** That is a hit.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** All right.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** And then on the second shot.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Oh, second shot probably misses.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** I got a 4 plus 4 for 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** Aren't you supposed to do damage on one, then roll for the other?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:39]** Do whatever you want, John.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:42]** Okay, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** I do whatever I want because I'm the rules lawyer.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** I make the rules.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** I found it, Paizo.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Four plus four for eight points of damage.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** Eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Not bad.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Yes, John?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Go ahead, talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:09]** As soon as Steven looks around angry at you and is surveying the room,

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:25]** I feel like in the, the view of the troll from like 12 feet up, you know, like 10 or 12 feet up, like, and sees the troll polyp, sees the Electrovor, sees like people moving in the distance, but maybe they're like, they're far distance.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:29]** Depth of field is not as like strong as, as, as, as the close distance.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** And then looks at you.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** And there's just this laser.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:38]** Like, it's like the red dot, like goes onto its eye, blows out its eye and,

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** And the quantum troll is dead.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Yes.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Nice.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Amazing.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Amazing.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** That's an avocado eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Oh, we got to keep hitting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** With lots of energy, different kinds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:58]** All right, it is the troll polyp's turn.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:05]** You have knocked down the troll, and we will see what happens with regeneration when it comes to the troll's turn.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:10]** The troll polyp is going to attack the Electrovor because the Electrovor just did a tail slap.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:18]** So, of course, it can turn its focus after not being able to hit Colin for like two or three times in a row, going to slam the Electrovor.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** It's out of the box.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** That is a 20 against the Electrovor.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** Oh, please stay up, Electrovor.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:37]** It's 11 points of damage, bludgeoning damage to the Electrovor, and the Electrovor needs to make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** All right, I will do that.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** What's the... It's Dex, right?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Bonus for Reflex?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Is that right?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Cool.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** He passes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** He's good.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** He's good.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** He's not entangled.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:58]** The splutter and goo doesn't keep the Electrovor down.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Fantastic.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Fantastic.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** The quantum troll falls to the ground.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** One eye shot out.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:24]** And for a second, you're like, you breathe a sigh of relief until one arm comes up and it pushes itself back up, leaning on its elbows.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:28]** And that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** No!

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** No.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** What?

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** This is the fight that never ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** It's been four episodes.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Four episodes.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Has it really been that many?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Yes.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** What the?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:51]** Actually, we also saw a dog eat an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:06]** Hey there, Will No Relation here to say thanks for listening and to invite you to join in on all the behind the scenes tomfoolery by heading to our Discord where we discuss everything you ever wanted to know behind the episode and more.
