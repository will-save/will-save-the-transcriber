**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:08]** With the Belita falling lifeless to the floor, the group is left in thoughtful silence.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:17]** Another painful reminder that they are just test subjects of a cruel and advanced collection of greys.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:22]** Dr. Roke examines the body and deduces that the Belita died from a cortex bomb.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:31]** This revelation leads Hears to believe that maybe Lozu and the other crew members of the Chimera died the same way.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:37]** Our adventurers then investigate the adjacent room and find remnants of some demonic destruction.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:43]** At a dead end, the group decides to face off once more with the feral Greybounder.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** How will they fare this time?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:43]** All right, I'm going to say it.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** I'm going to say it.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** And don't you stop me.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:52]** There's nothing you could do to stop me from saying that you're not physically here.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** There's nothing you could say that could stop me from saying what I'm about to say.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Wait, John.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** What the hell?

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Don't.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** What?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Don't do it.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Give me one good reason.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** Give me one good reason to not say it, Kev.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** I can just talk over you, too.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Why?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:16]** And then I would just mute you and put in, like, the voice of Pikachu in the after recording.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Pikachu.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Pikachu.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Pikachu talking.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Pikachu.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Pikachu.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** All right, so what I'm going to say is that we are within...

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:51]** avocado yeah we'll just replace your voice uh with kuhlhauser no we are within firing range of our 50th episode do you realize that this is episode 41 41 it's true the range of podcast is 10 episodes so we are within firing range of episode 50 that's a big thing is it wait is that in the core rebook yeah that's in the core rebook if you start a podcast with starfinder then your range is 10 episodes

**[00:02:51 - 00:03:16]** yeah pretty crazy isn't that crazy in the bylaws that's pretty crazy yeah it's yeah it's pretty crazy it doesn't feel real right now because we're at 41 and before you get to 45 you're like any number past the fives place is doesn't exist no we're like in that blurry stage we're like you know it doesn't feel like it's been like a like it feels like we've been recording just that we've been playing this like yeah you know forever yeah like we it's like we'd never not recorded


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** Yeah, but at the same time, it was just like yesterday that we started recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Yeah.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** Because you know it's right after 50, it's 52.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** It's a whole year.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** It's a whole year.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:25]** Whole year.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** It's like 50 is a mirage on the horizon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Yeah.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** And we recorded that first episode right before my son was born.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:34]** Yes.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:39]** And we're recording this episode right around my son's first year mark.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:44]** But not to age the podcast or anything because my son turned one in September.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** But to be fair.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:49]** Happy birthday, Grayson!

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** This whole episode is dedicated to Grayson.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Good job.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** And now Kevin's already getting into play with dice.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Yep.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** He's all set.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Pretty soon, he'll be on the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** I gave him that big Kraken dice that I got from Gen Con.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I decided to just let Grayson have it.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** That's awesome.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** It's big enough that he can't choke on it, so it's good.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yeah, because it's huge.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Thank you, Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Thank you, Kraken, for making baby-proof dice.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** For when you need math rocks that are not choking hazards...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** Yeah, it's like a Duplo-sized math rock.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** It's great.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Go to Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** Who do you think Grayson will play on the podcast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Who's his first character?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Probably... I don't know.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** He's probably not going to be able to even talk for a year or two.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Okay.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:36]** I think she could make a terrifying AI voice if we, like, digitize this voice.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** That's right.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Who would be?

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** Baby voices are terrifying when you, like, post-process them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** All right.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Then let's post-process some baby voices.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** He's going to play all the goblins.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** All the goblins.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** Oh, I'm so down.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** That's actually a great idea.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** He needs to make any of your important rolls.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** You just hand him the big guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** He's usually asleep by the time we start recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** That's not possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Grayson, wake up.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Roll this for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** Hey, kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:19]** He did say, like, he's funny because he's in that stage right now where he's, like, repeating things, but not, like, he's not, like, actually repeating things because, you know, he doesn't have the vocal, like, ability yet, but he's, like, mimicking things, and he sneezed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** I'm sorry, I think the chair broke a little bit in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** Wait, Nick, what happened?

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** His chair broke.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** Well, that's canon now.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:32]** Yeah, that's staying in the episode that Nick's chair broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Your face looked like you were choking on something.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** I legit was like, I had 911 ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:41]** Nick got poked because something went through the seat cushion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** I got to buy a new chair now, so that's one of the things I got to do.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** All right.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:56]** Well, now this is back up the river, but all I was going to say is that Grayson sneezed, and I said Gesundheit to him, and he replied with Gesundheit.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:02]** So my son tried to say Gesundheit, and I was like, that's impressive.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** That was perfect.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** That's what I'm going to say from now on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:13]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** That's how that goes.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Nick, are you okay?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Are you traumatized from the chair break?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** Yeah, I'm all right.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** I'm all good.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Okay.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** Did you get a stool to replace the chair or are you back in the same chair?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Oh, I'm back in the same chair.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** It's still workable.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** Don't you sell office equipment?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Not chairs, dude.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Not chairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** It's like chair salesman, the lowest of the low.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** I'm at the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** Tomorrow's a busy day for me, actually.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** I got one demo and an RFP due.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** What's an RFP?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** For the city of Pasadena Finance Department.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** I got TPS reports due.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Okay, awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:58]** We all got some work to do, but right now, we got some stuff running to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:24]** but i have a question oh wait what can i go i was just gonna say like we did some research and stuff and you can in fact use supercharge on a grenade according to the rules you can but but it's an area attack so it only gives a plus 2d6 where a single attack gives you plus 46 so just keep that in mind i think maybe we should again say when you say we did some research who are you referring to

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Who are you really referring to?

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:30]** I personally looked it up, but at the same time, of course, I referred back to our paralegals on Discord.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** And Jeremy was very quick to respond.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Thanks, Jeremy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Member of the willing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** Our paralegal and member of the willing.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** A well of knowledge.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** A will of knowledge.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Yes.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** Yes.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** I wasn't asking a question, but I kind of just want to get into the game.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** No, ask the question.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** You sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** You sure?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** That's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Do it.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** All right.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:59]** This is one of those questions that you just got to roll with it.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** You're a burglar.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:05]** And you've been contracted to take to burgle somebody's house.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I think that's the technical term.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** Or Bogart.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:11]** But you can only take things that mildly inconvenience people.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** What do you take?

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Is this for the characters or for the players?

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** This is just for the players.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** I just want to know.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** I just saw this and thought this is a great question.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Take all the toilet paper.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** Yeah, that was my first question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** That is good.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** That's pretty bad.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:28]** I would probably take, like, one half of every pair of shoes they have.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** That's good.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** That's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:39]** I would take the batteries out of everything and put it right back where it was, and that way they wouldn't even notice.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** But they'd know, like, their things weren't working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Oh, that's cruel.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Just reverse them inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** I thought of... Oh, yeah, just turn them around.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** They're like, I thought that I put it in there.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** I didn't even steal anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** The badges are inside.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** I don't know what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:00]** I cut them off from the electrical grid so they go inside and everything's just off.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** That sounds... That's majorly inconvenient.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** Yeah, that's hugely inconvenient.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** That's like affecting quality of life.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** So is taking all the toilet paper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:16]** No, what if they had like a snowstorm and all their heaters were electric?

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** You just killed a family, man.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** You just killed them, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** We should restate that Kevin lives in Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** I'm going to jokingly say this, but liabilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** Liabilities, naturally.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Every time.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** That's always what it is.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:35]** That's always what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:40]** Seriously, I think we should have a shirt that says join the willing or become a liability.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** That's actually pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:49]** For all of you willing and all of you listeners, we are taking Birch ideas as of now, apparently.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** So if you have suggestions, please send them to us.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:57]** I was thinking either the plate inside the microwave or shaving gel.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** Because both, it just sucks to not have any, you know?

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** What's the plate inside the microwave thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Yeah.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** The disc, like the plate that rotates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Oh, you would steal that plate?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** You can buy one on Amazon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** Not an inconvenience.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** But see, it was mild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** That's the point.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** You could also steal the knife and silverware set so they have to eat everything with their hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** What if you dulled all the knives?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** Ooh, see, that is some next level thinking.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:27]** Because then you're cutting the tomato and then all the juice just gets on the counter.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Like, oh, I gotta go get another knife.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, and then...

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:35]** And then they're out of their... They only have one shoe, so they can't really go anywhere, and they gotta walk to the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:41]** They just try to tenderize everything so that it just, like, slides apart when you pull it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** It's a good idea.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** It's a good idea.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** Alright, now, are we ready to play, Kev?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I will defer to Kev.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Kev, are we ready to play?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Oh, I'm... Yeah, we're ready.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Let's do it!

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Alright, let's play!

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Let's play!

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** Let's play.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:03]** I was trying to mimic the voice I did in, I think, in episode two when I was like, let's play.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** I think I overemphasized it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** Let's play Starfinder.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Short story real quick.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:19]** So John was in a band and they performed at a live, or not live, but like a movie in the park before the movie.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** And the movie was going to be The Mask.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** And he was so excited during his show.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** He was like, we're going to sing just one more song.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** And then after that, we're going to watch The Mask.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:32]** Yeah, I was like voice like crackled and it was just like, oh, it was it was a magical moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** I was transported back to my voice.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** Yeah, it was great.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Was that the gig up in Altendina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Was that the gig up in Altendina?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** Yeah, Kev, I think you and I both went to that.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Yeah, Bodhi was there.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Yeah.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** No, that was the one where we were watching.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** He's done that gig more than once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:56]** Honestly, my gigs are where I practice my voices for all the NPCs.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** That's right.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** So there's going to be one who's like, hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:03]** He's like, hey, let's watch The Mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Guys, my favorite movie is The Mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** That's where you did your goblin voices.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Let us watch Jaws.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Jaws.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** That's it.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Hashtag couples retreat.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Couples retreat.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** All right.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:15]** Let's play.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Let's play.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** I'm sorry for derailing it.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Just going to take it out on your character, not you.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** It's fine.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Rude.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Rude.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:31]** So you guys, last time, last episode was not a lot of...

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:56]** physical combat there was a lot of mental concern not mental combat just mental concern as you guys dealt with the fact that possibly the first individual since leaving the chimera possibly even maybe in the whole adventure so far that you've met died in front of you after trying to attack you feeling driven out of fear

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:09]** You understand that their death might not be in vain as you might begin to understand more about your circumstances from their death.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** So, Dr.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:17]** O.K., take some tissue samples from this bolita to be studied at a later date.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:22]** You continue and move into the only other door.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** There are two doors that you know that you've left unexplored.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:35]** One is on the other side of that feral gray bounder, and the other is just on the other side of this hallway that you were in.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** So you go to that room, completely empty.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:47]** Air, frigid, giant crack filled with ice and some pale material in the wall.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:58]** You ascertain that some sort of external force caused this crack to happen and likely everything in the room was just taken out.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** Emergency sealant and ice filled up the crack.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:10]** And as you're leaving, you do detect a sense of supernatural evil, extra planar.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:20]** It could possibly be from whatever demonic whims or experiments that the greys have had.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:32]** So you steel yourselves and through some moments of levity in this hellish place, you make your way back to the data foundry.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:53]** where the gray was originally and back to the two doors leading into the room with the gray bounder your plan get to the second door nico hacks it so it only opens a little bit here's supercharges the grenade

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:59]** Dr. Okay, ready to be on standby, attack.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** I'm ready to slime it out with anybody.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** He slimes just as good as any Osharu.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** That's what they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** He's going to slime Nickelodeon style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:16]** There's a laugh track to pull a rope and slime just falls down on top of you.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** Oh, it's like when you accept the kid's choice award.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Yeah.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** So because you're supercharging a grenade,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** What, what, what, what?

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:33]** All right, so before we get into what's going to happen, I do want to bring up conspiracy theory conversation stuff.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Please.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Always welcome.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** If the Belita had the Cortex bomb, so did the other Greys.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Everybody on board had them.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:49]** We know now that, yes, it was some kind of simulation, right?

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** The Chimera was some kind of simulation.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** But...

**[00:15:52 - 00:16:04]** It was an actual ship and the people on board were actual people with these chips in their necks or these bombs in their necks.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:21]** So it could be that Lozu and these other characters were kidnapped prior and then brainwashed possibly into either replaying their own histories or playing out the scripts that the greys had given them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:28]** I still think they're people like us, and I kind of am wondering whether or not we have those chips in our head.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** So I think that needs to be a priority for us to find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** We will find out when we have the time, I hope.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** Wait, couldn't we just look at, like, shine a flashlight into Dr.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** O.K.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** 's neck and see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:45]** Because he's translucent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, that actually might work.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** John?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** I'm going to defer to the expert himself, Dr.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** O.K.,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:20]** uh sure i suppose i don't think that your skin is translucent uh perhaps there's some confusion as to the makeup of my skin but um i don't know it's stronger than your kin or yes yes but what i mean by uh in this sense uh you can't see through me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:26]** Yeah, but like human skin, you can shine a light through it and see glow.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Your skin's more so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** Come give Dr. Okay your foot.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:35]** Here, you want to pull up a tentacle?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** Take a look for yourself.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** I don't know if I want to.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** Have at it, droid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:53]** Rick pulls out his flashlight and shines it through your hand and is like, I believe we might be able to see if there was anything in there.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Can you please stretch out your neck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Well, wait, hold on.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** We're opening a door right now, guys.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** We're opening a door.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** We opened a door last time.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** Here, let's pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Alright, alright.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** But now, back to the opening the door conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Well, hold on.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** I don't know that you can just see through Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:18]** That's my general sense, is that Dr. O'Kane's not, like, translucent.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:25]** Like, I don't think when surgeons go into the OR, they're like, alright, give me your flashlight, and they just put it on the back of your head to, like, see what's in there.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Jon's just like, I don't know if I want it to be that easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Yeah, maybe.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** No, but in general, I don't know that Osharus have, like, transparent skin where you can just shine a light and see their organs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Well, I think Will is in agreement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** No.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:44]** I mean, there's bioluminescence in my body that's giving off light.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** Like, how could you even...

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** You couldn't even really penetrate that.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** I'm honestly not going to say that you can't do it.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Like, you should try and do it.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** What kind of radiation are you hitting me with, Kev?

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** Photons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** That's good enough for Marvel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** Okay, so it's not going to work.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** Anyways, moving back to the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** I would give you some measure of success if you rolled really high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** No, and we're in the middle of throwing a grenade, John.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Stop trying to distract us.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** I'm just trying to say what you could do.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** You're the one who distracted us, Kev.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** I know, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Yeah, you are.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** So, here.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** You're gonna supercharge your grenade.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** You're throwing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Yeah, but we talked about this off-air.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** We looked it up rule-wise.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** I think it's better to have an understanding of what we're doing.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** No, it's 2d6.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:37]** So the way a supercharged weapon is written is if you're doing a single attack, it is 4d6 of damage.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:44]** If you're doing an area effect that hits multiple or all creatures in the area, then it is only 2d6 of damage.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:50]** So we're technically wasting the supercharge on a single player, if that makes any sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:55]** That being said, as much as I would love to recall it, I don't think we should retcon it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:01]** I mean, he hasn't done it yet, so Rick could just yank the grenade away from him before he supercharges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** I feel like you already committed to doing it.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** If you really don't want to do it, make your case.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** But I feel like you already committed to doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** I agree.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** We already had so much discussion about it.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** The door is opening now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:19]** I just don't like to make uninformed decisions and you force us into these uninformed decisions when we can't review the description well enough.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** I would have called objection and would have sidebarred it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** And we would have gotten some rules and legals in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** I know.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Spent some billable hours with the firm.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** Whose herebrained idea was this anyhow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** But the situation is filing an injunction against us.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** And it will proceed as planned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** So here's what's going to happen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** Proceed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** Because you're supercharging the grenade, you said it's 3d6 now, right?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** It's now 2d6 additional damage.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** It's an extra 2d6, and the grenade does 1d6?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:55]** The grenade does 1d6, and then the supercharged weapon does extra 2d6.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:00]** If you do it on a regular weapon, then it does 4d6 additional damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Right, right, right.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** Okay, so that is more than I thought originally.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** But I will still say that my thought is this.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** You're supercharging a frag grenade, correct?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** And you're throwing- Incendiary.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Incendiary grenade.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** And you're throwing it into a small space.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:41]** with a rock ceiling so i'm just going to say right now that if you meet a threshold of damage then i will something will happen and that something will cause essentially probably random rocks or random events to happen and they will happen probably for a certain number of rounds and

**[00:21:41 - 00:22:01]** and be based on the square randomly decided which square it will happen in a small room so if you are in that room and you are in that square when it lands in that square then you will take damage uh or something will happen and you will have a chance to obviously avoid that happening uh

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:07]** But, yeah, just telling you, since that's the choice that you made, that's likely what will happen, depending on the damage that you roll.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** I'm sorry.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** And, again, just rules lawyering all this stuff.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** The incendiary grenade only has a five-foot radius, so it's not even going to fill the whole room.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Oh.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** What the fuck?

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** So our whole plan is bunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Well, wait.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** No, we were told, yeah.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** It's a five foot radius.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** All kinds of misinformation.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** That's a terrible freaking grenade.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** It's a terrible grenade.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** In this universe, the Starfinder universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** So it's a five foot radius.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** So it's only going to do.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** It's a one square.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** It's a square.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Well, it's a five foot radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** It'd be four squares.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Four squares.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Because you hit a corner.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:47]** Well, so, but you decide which square you're going to be in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** When you throw it, you... No, you pick a corner.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** And so it hit a corner, and it would be five in each direction.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** So it would be four squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:04]** It's still not a crap plan, because even if you throw it in the center of the room, so long as it reaches the damage threshold, the debris falling from the ceiling will do extra damage, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:34]** maybe it's I will say that the one thing that I will say is that because you're throwing it in I'm gonna give you one perception check to try and see where the creature is there you go to see what's going on because and you have a small sliver so I believe it's Rick 19 who is in that space correct so let's do well and and Nico well but Rick 19 someone who's throwing it yeah so Rick 19 is the only person who gets the perception check there's no other a just you

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** I think it makes sense since you're just trying to open it, close it.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Yeah.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** You're going to roll the big, the big crack and die.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** All right.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** We're all in world 20.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I'm going to bring you guys over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** My son's Duplo sized crack and die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Yep.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Okay.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** You guys should see yourselves there roughly in the order.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** You're right outside the range of, uh, of site there, but you can still grab your pawn.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** I think.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Yeah.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:58]** Yes.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:03]** I forget why you have a rook symbol on your thing.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** I don't know.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Yeah, I don't know either, but it's kind of cool.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** It's neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** What is going on in Rule 20?

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** What's going on in Rule 20?

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Something just happened on Rule 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** I changed you guys to a new map.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** Scroll down to the bottom right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** I know.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:20]** It's like when I scroll, it's pulling all directions.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** It's fine.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** I got it to work.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Thanks, Rule 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** Thanks, Rule 20.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:30]** In all honesty, I like this movie a lot.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** I like it.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Yeah, it's pretty cool.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** It's pretty sweet for what it does.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** It's probably the best of the bunch, honestly, in my mind.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** I have a lot of criticisms, but... There are some other ones.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:43]** I was trying to do some research, but this will never air, because then that would sound like we're trying to get away from 120.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** But they don't sponsor us anyways, so who cares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:52]** So if you want to make sure that what you say won't make it to air, just insult one of our non-existent sponsors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** That's the way to do it.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Like Linux.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Yeah, take that, Sprite.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Yeah, Sprite.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** Yeah, it's lame.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** 7up is way better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** You know what?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Screw you, Aspirin.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** You suck.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Screw you, Bayer.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** I hate Versace.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** I hate it.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** God.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** God.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Gucci, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Also, Kias?

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** Nah.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Get the hell out.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** I drive Kias.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** We can't go there on Kias.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Yeah, that's because you're a chair salesman.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** You're the lowest of the low, Nick.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:32]** I'm not one of the chairs out of your Kia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** He's sitting in his Kia chair.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Kia with chairs.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** That's why yours broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:56]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:03]** If you guys are ready, we're going to roll for initiative and we're going to start with Kev, who's going to go first, but we're going to be in initiative order and Kev will go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** I had my big dice out.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** Now I have to get my little dice out.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Well, yeah, because that's what we got to do.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** We are rolling for initiative.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Ten plus something.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Ten plus something.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Ten plus four.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Fourteen.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** I don't like this one.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** I want this one.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** I didn't like that roll either.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Let me do it again.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** No, don't.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** We're just kidding.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** I'm kidding.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** I'm kidding.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** It was a joke.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** Get out of here, kitty cat.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Nico, Ryan's got a 16.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Let's go in order.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** Give me un momento por favor.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:42]** Let me roll my first die here with this new set that I got.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** It's a new set?

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Yeah.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** That's the roll that I was looking for.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** There it is.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** All right.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** Who got a 20 or over?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** All right, 15 or over.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** That's me.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Nico, you got 16.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** Anybody else?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Going once, going twice.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** 10 or over.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Okay.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Rick raised his hand.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Good for radio.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** What did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** What did you roll?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** You asked me first.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** I got a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** You got a 14.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Okay.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** All right.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Five are over.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** We're getting here in the chair salesman range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Wait a second.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** I don't want to be compared to a chair salesman.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:25]** Also, yeah, I got a five on my new Norse Foundry dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Oh, wow.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Five.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** I got a six.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Wow.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Okay.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** For a total of seven.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** You had seven last time that I had this in the Don John, so it's perfect.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:45]** I feel like it would make sense, though, because I'm at least outside of the immediate area from the rest of the guys, and I'm just kind of rolling my eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:51]** And I think it makes sense that Nico is first because he's ready to go.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** He's ready to close the door.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Then it's Rick.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Then Dr. K is in the back.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** And I'm guessing that here is maybe you were just casting Supercharge.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** So you're coming out of that mental space, right, where you were casting the spell.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Yeah, we'll just say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** That is the order that we're in.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:10]** And it kind of makes sense, too, because Rick gets the surprise round, throws the grenade, and then he has to shift back to his weapon.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** It all makes sense.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** It's amazing.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** These random rolls perfectly align.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** Nothing is truly random.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Nothing happens by accident.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** Picking up on the threads.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Finding connections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** Finding connections.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** All right.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:33]** So, Rick, I believe you have one perception check, and it will tell you the square in which the monster is in.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** And then from there, you can know.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** You press the door, right?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Nico presses it.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** Open.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** It stops.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** Maybe there's like a foot that it's open.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Maybe 10 inches.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:54]** Just enough for you to see the room, throw it where you want to throw it, and you've got to give me a perception check.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** As it comes open, you can see the room here on roll 20, though.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** It's that same...

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:29]** room where there's just still a bunch of dust there's that there's this wall with like gold and silver wires running up from the floor to the ceiling and there's this machine with shards of smoky crystal that are anchored inside of it and there is a like completely smashed and destroyed workstation in the southwest corner along with a chair and there's some sort of humanoid form that you can see among the wreckage there uh and there's just debris and rubble everywhere

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:38]** And as you open the door, you do, all of you, in your minds, hear this, like... Oh, God.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Not that again.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** Give me your perception check, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** Okay, so I'm rolling my... It's a two-inch face-to-face.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Amazing.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** By Kraken Dice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** By Kraken Dice.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** You know who's not cherished?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:00]** The problem is that this dice doesn't fit into my dice towers.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Oh, it's true.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** And I'm not going to roll it on my glass desktop.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** You want to roll it on the floor?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:14]** I'm just dropping it on the floor, which I have a carpet floor, so... Okay.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** That was a 20.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** No kidding.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Amazing.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** There we go.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Natural 20.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Cracking face up.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** Cracking face up.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Cracking up.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Cracking up.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Cracking up.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** You'll love to see it.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** So it's a 20 with a plus 6, a 26 to see this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** All right.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:39]** I am going to say because that was just so perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Something about.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** It's like right at the crack where the door opens.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** It's right in front of your face.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:47]** I see it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Hello, ugly.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:59]** So you see there must be something from this mass of gold and silver and crystals, that light that's emanating from it.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** It's pulsing.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:07]** And as you hear that snarl in your mind, you are able to see that immediately.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** I'm just going to reveal it here.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** I want to immediately in front of that snarl.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:39]** mass is where this bounder is and you see that it's probably about 15 feet away almost in front of the door on the other side of the room and you remember that when this thing first attacked you it charged and pounced at you and it got two attacks and so as a result it is something that is gonna back up and it's gonna ready itself to charge and pounce that's why it's in the square that it's in right there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Okay.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** That's comforting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Yeah.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** It's ready to do the do.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:52]** And Rick19, you have a chance to throw your grenade.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** All right.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** And I'm going to say that, Nico, probably you have a...

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** You probably readied your action for throwing the grenade so then you can take your turn immediately, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:08]** Yeah, so I readied my action to close the door immediately after the grenade's thrown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Yeah, because I don't want to rob that from you.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** You've got that plan.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:18]** And obviously you don't know the initiative of the creature, but I don't want to take away that thought from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** So technically here's at this point is supercharging it.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Cause he readied it.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** So yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:30]** So Rick, as like the door slides open, Rick has his eyes on the door and he can see this thing straight ahead.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** Yeah.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:37]** Um, and then he, he feels the grenade just glow with power as he is charging.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** It's kind of a warm glow.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** And, and he just lobs it between the door, right at the thing.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** So I'm going to aim.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:48]** I'm actually going to aim for the backside of it.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** He,

**[00:32:48 - 00:33:18]** where oh the corner okay so it's the corner between the smashed workstation and the creature yeah so i again we got to double check how how thrown weapons work but i it says i have a plus five on hero lab then i think that would mean that you would hit it because technically i think for grenades you have to hit ac5 to hit that square so you would just roll to make sure that you didn't fire and something else yeah you would just roll to make sure that you didn't critically fail that's the that's the move and i have a range of 20 so it'd be right at my actual range okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** That makes a lot of sense.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** So you don't even want me to roll for that?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:25]** No, you do need to roll because the whole point is that... Don't roll a one.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** Yeah, don't roll a one because if you roll a one, that's the fail.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I rolled a seven.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Okay.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Close.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Close.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** That was probably not the roll you wanted to have, but it was close.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** No.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** All right.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:44]** So you throw this.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:53]** You throw the grenade, and it lands in the square, and as it's being thrown, you still hear that, like, in your mind.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** It hits the square.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** And I'm pretty sure that as it's thrown, Nico, you're watching.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** You see the grenade leave his hand.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Beep.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** It closes.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:11]** And as soon as it closes, there is just a massive, like...

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:18]** that just rings the door and you feel the ground beneath you vibrate.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** And I'll put in some crazy big explosion sound that I don't have ready on a siren scape right now.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** But that is insane.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** You need to roll for damage and let's see what damage you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** All right.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** So it was one D six from the grenade itself.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** Okay.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** That was a two.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Um, and another two.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** Okay.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** And a one.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Plus 7.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Plus 7 from the supercharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** Because it's 2d6.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Wait, you get 2d6 plus 7?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** I rolled the d6s, yeah.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Oh, damn, let's take yours then.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** I rolled 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** I think it would make sense.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** I think it would make sense that if you did that, then... So it was two plus seven, so nine?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** Nine points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** That makes me feel better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I'm going to burn my dice now.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** I'm going to burn the dice that I got.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** They're made of aluminum, so it's not going to do much to it.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:16]** Let's see.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Okay.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** That's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:26]** Also, are there any harmful effects to this thing, like inflamed or horror?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** What?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** To the incendiary grenade?

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:33]** Does the incendiary grenade have any additional effects in addition to the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:36]** Yeah, it has a critical effect, but we didn't hit the critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** We didn't hit the crit.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Didn't hit the crit.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** There's a reflex save, right?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Too legit to crit.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** For the grenade?

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** That I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** There is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:36:11]** believe her reflex you can attempt a reflex save it's a dc 15 dc 15 all right let's see if that that halves damage that halves damage oh that was a natural one on the reflex save so it takes yeah so it quadruples damage uh i don't know i didn't see that part in the in the core rubric it's in there i swear this is weird yeah it's written in in handwriting yeah just kidding

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:26]** I will just tell you guys so you know that part of the gray bounders and grays, their phase ability, they do have a 20% mischance against attacks and effects targeting it directly, and they only take half damage from area effects.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** So it takes half damage.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Oh, come on now.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:33]** But it's half of the quadruple damage, right?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** The quadruple damage is not real, but it's half of that damage.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Good try, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:44]** So if you would have failed or passed the fortitude save, it would have been half of the half?


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Okay.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** So then it takes the full amount of half.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Nine.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** So then it's like, what, four?

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:49]** Four.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Yeah.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** You always run down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** So it takes four points of damage and... I'll never throw in a grenade again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** Wow, that was not a good use of supercharged weapon in retrospect.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Well, it's because of the grenades.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:06]** There's also the fact that I think grenades get a lot better the lot higher mark they are, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Oh, yeah, definitely.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** Also, I kind of think it makes sense from a story standpoint.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:19]** We don't necessarily know what we're up against, and we're fighting these things, so we're fighting living individuals that are just like us.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** That's true.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** We're figuring it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:26]** Yeah, and you fought now, too, so I figured you would probably know that by now.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** You would recall that there's this phase effect that they have.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** We'll recall from now on, that's for sure.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** That's for sure.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** All right.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Because that's an avocado-eating dog.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** That's an avocado-eating bounder.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** I'm going to tell you right now, you met the critical threshold.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Wait, what?

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** What do you mean?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** Oh, the damage to the room?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** Yeah.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Great.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Wow.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Yeah.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:52]** But considering the fact that... The fortitude save was for the room, not for the boundary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** I did roll a fortitude save for the room.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** I totally forgot about that.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:01]** So I'm going to go ahead and work that in.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:07]** But I will, for now, I think we're going to just move in initiative order.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** And we will see what happens.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Top of round one.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** It's the Greybounders' turn.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** What does it do?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** You don't know.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Next up, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** What are you doing?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** So Nico is going to look back to the rest of the group.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** He's like, all right, guys, you ready to do this again?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** Rick19, get in position.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:33]** If you got a rifle, get it ready, and I'm going to open the door just a sliver again, and you're going to shoot through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Copy that.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:39]** And he kneels down and lays her up over his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Wait a second.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Question.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** Yes?

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:47]** Could we theoretically all... So, the Bounder just went in an initiative order.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Yeah, it did.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Can we delay an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, I mean, you can guess that it probably delayed or readied an action.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** It did something.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** It did something.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Okay, but we know it just acted first.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Okay.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** And we could coordinate opening the door for a sliver.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** So could we all theoretically shoot simultaneously?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Within the same six seconds, yeah.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:14]** The problem is that his action is to open the door, so then it's going to be the next round to close it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** Unless you're doing two move actions and he delays one move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** But it does give us cover.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** It does give us some extra cover.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** And it'll make it difficult for the thing to slip through.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Against Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:32]** Or somebody else closes it on their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:37]** Well, Dr. Okade, if you want to be the one closing it, I got some pretty good range skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** Here is your last initiative, right?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** Yep.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Okay.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** So what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:51]** Well, just to clarify, so if Nico doesn't do any actions except open and shut the door, he has two move actions because he has a move and a standard.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** So he can use his move action to open the door and his standard to shut it.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** So he can just delay his standard action to shut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** But that would also move my place in initiative order, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** I also don't know that you can, like, take one action, then delay the rest of your action.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Yeah.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** You can?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:13]** So, I think it's better if he opens it, shoots, hears, closes it.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Okay.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Magic.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** If you're not sure what to do with your turn, you can delay an action.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** You must declare your delaying before taking any actions on your turn.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** This does not require spending an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** No, do you see what I'm saying, though, guys?

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:30]** We can coordinate our opening between us as characters.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:37]** Can't we, like, can't Nick allow here's to close the door for him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:42]** He'd have to, like, open it and move, and then here's where you have to, like, reach through him to shut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** But you can occupy the same square as a friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** I can, like, manipulate the door.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** You can move through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** I can also just have... I have an invisible servant.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** He can close doors for me as, like, a...

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Oh, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** There you go.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** That is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** He can do that.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** You don't need to move or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:06]** Okay, so... Sorry, there's delay, which moves your turn.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** You're right.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** It's a full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** We didn't want to move his turn.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** I wanted to keep our initiative order the same.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** We just coordinate closing the door.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** Yeah.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Okay.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** I mean, sure.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:23]** So, like, open, attack, close, all in one round, basically, right?

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:48]** yeah so explain to me how this is gonna happen what's your plan uh nico open the door and then fire and then could you walk through kevin fire and then i'll fire and then you'll close the door with the servant then on the next turn nico will step back and hold an action to fire just do it again well yeah so okay so nico's gonna open the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** That's your turn.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** Then Rick is going to fire.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** No.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** This isn't his whole turn.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** He can shoot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** But you're only going to open it up a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** If you only open it up a little bit, you can't shoot past the door.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** The only person who can shoot is Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** Yeah.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Oh, so we want to open it all the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** No.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** That's to give cover.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** So that way this thing can't get us.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** I don't want that thing near me.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** The only person that can attack is Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** We can close it before the end of our turn.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Before it acts.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** So effectively, it's like that six seconds, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:24]** Well, it'll still be up against the door, so the moment we open, it might get an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** It could eventually move to us, right?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Oh yeah, if it's at the door.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** That's true.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** It would get an attack of opportunity.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Ah, fuck.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** I hate this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** Sure you do, Kev.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** Sure you do.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** So unless you're holding a melee weapon, in which case you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** What's it going to be?

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** What's it going to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:49]** Nico's going to open the door again, just a smidge.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** And he's going to say, Rick, take your shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Okay.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** The door opens again, the same 10 or 12 inches.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:02]** And Rick, you just see the creature like...

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:29]** bound towards you and you hear in your mind like you do not belong as this creature starts to move toward you and it has now moved its place in initiative and i believe unless you're going to do anything else with your turn nico then it will be rick's turn yep okay rick what are you doing on your turn you got this creature right in front of you if i use a range attack he's gonna hurt me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** This is so annoying.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Get it with your axe.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:38]** Well, I don't know if I can strike through the ten inches that are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:42]** Well, remember, he... I don't know where... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** You'd have cover.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:47]** He, like, yeah, like, it has cover from... You wouldn't get... You have cover from it.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** You wouldn't get an AOL because you have cover.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Does cover... Oh, that's right.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Does cover prevent AOLs?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** I think so.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Not melee.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Does cover prevent it, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** This was talked about in the Discord.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Like, so, you can attack and then hide again.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** You can attack from cover with melee, I thought.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** From what I understood from that conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** You can attack from cover with a ranged weapon and not incur an attack of opportunity, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** If you're behind cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Yeah.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** That would make sense.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** Why would someone get an attack of opportunity from a 12-inch opening in a door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** I'm pretty sure you're absolutely right about that.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** I just want to look at combat modifiers real quick.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** Yeah, if you have cover relative to an enemy, you can't make an attack for opportunity against you.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Done.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Okay, so Rick is going to shoot.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Okay, so you're going to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** It will have cover from you.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:47]** I think, tell me if I'm wrong, I think from all of that, it's probably going to be improved.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:57]** Well, the fact that you guys are, like, it's right in front of you, I would have said improved cover, but I feel like it's just standard cover.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** which is plus four to AC, plus two to bonus.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** So it will have cover from you.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** You will have cover from it.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Yeah.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Just cover, not improve cover.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Not improve cover.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Okay.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** What's ref on here?

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** Okay.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** That makes sense.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** After all this, Nico opens the door.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:26]** This bounder snarls in your mind and tells you that GTFO comes up to right in front of Rick, this mouth gnashing at you, scorpion tail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:33]** You shoot and... I have a five plus eight for a total of 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** Yeah, that's not gonna... I guess EAC or KC?

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Probably EAC, right?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** EAC.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Yeah, that's not going to hit.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:44]** It's not going to do the trick.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** Poop your pants?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** You want to take a guarded step back behind me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:55]** And then... Maybe you'll just rocket boot out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:03]** And then that would... I mean, technically, that could open up the lane for Hears to take a shot.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** And then he could use unseen servant.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** I'll do the guard step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** Nico, if you're going to take a shot, because actually, Nico, it is.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Well, actually, it's Dr. O'K's turn right now.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** So we'll get to you, Nico, if you take a shot.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** So is the door open?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** The door is open.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** You do have line of sight.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** I feel like since you're more than 10 feet away, it might become improved cover.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** But I feel like he's right there.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** So it's probably just cover.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** Like it's a pretty clear shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:35]** Okay, so I'm going to hit him with the Custard Jet Liquidator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** Custard Jet Liquidator.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** Yeah.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:43]** You aim it over his shoulder, and you shoot.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Yeah.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** Kapow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Ooh.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Do you see this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** What was that?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** A 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** That was a netty 19.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** All right.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:59]** That is going to be a hit against the AC.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** That's KAC, right?

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:04]** Against KAC plus the four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** So it's 23.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** Yeah, it's going to be a hit.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Let's see.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:12]** As you shoot, let's see if it phases through the creature.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** No.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:30]** It seems like for a second, almost in slow motion, it seems to phase as if it thinks it's going to go right through, and then it comes back into phase, and your Costa Jet, boom, hits the fleshy, muscular, gray, feral beast.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** How much damage did you do?

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Max damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:37]** Not quite max damage, but six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Six damage.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:49]** Okay, we hear in your mind's eye, you hear this like, and then this like, I will whip you over.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:56]** And the snarl comes into your brain as a response to your shot.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Here's your turn.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Unless you want to do anything else, Dr. Oakley.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** No, that's it.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** Okay.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:05]** Here's what you're going to do when it comes for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** When it comes for me?

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:14]** So no one's covering the... I can just run up and press it and then keep moving, right?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Until I close it?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** Or is that a full movement action just to close the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** They're going to use your ghost hand thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Well, I might not need to because no one's in my way anymore.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Well, Nico's right there, right?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Yeah, I think it's in this.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Oh, okay.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Do you want to close the door now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Well, yeah.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** I mean, that was the plan.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** That was your plan.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Yeah.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Yeah.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** All right.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:39]** Well, here's, like, says, like, wakey, wakey to his, like, little servant.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** He hasn't named him yet, but maybe, like, Patch or something.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** I don't know.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:47]** And then, like, this, like, servant comes out of his hand, and he, like, walks over to the door and closes it.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:54]** Like, Nico, you feel, like, a ghostly, like, being, like, go right in front of you, almost into your body, because it's, like, right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** I think it could probably phase through this wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** It probably could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** That's what I'm afraid of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Oh, you mean the Greybounder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** If it could have done it, it would have done it already.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Can I do a culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:15]** See if they can face... I guess you wouldn't be... Well, I'll say players give me a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Use your player wisdom bonus.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** It's whatever you think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** 5 plus 3 is 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** 19 plus 3, that's a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:35]** I'm going to say that you do recall that the gray in the data foundry at some point was able to move its hand through.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:40]** So there's a good chance that this thing could attack through a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** But the gray in the data foundry was totally different, I thought.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** I thought that this is a dumber version of a gray.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** It's like a gray dog or something.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** You're the GM.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:55]** You basically gave us the answer, so I suppose it can't go through.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Sorry, it's not even an alien.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** It's just like a gray golden retriever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:24]** said that i could see it phasing just or attempting to phase a moment ago right i say like a chihuahua yeah when you shot it yeah like the point is that like it didn't meet the phase that it that it it didn't meet the the like 20 chance got it yeah well maybe it'll take a turn to do it though i don't know maybe we get some time we'll see anyway it's done shatter whatever closed it so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** What's the name of your... I'm not sure.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** I have to find out.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** But for now, it's Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** I feel like if it's Chad, it's Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** He's like, alright, bro.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Gonna do it.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:42]** Here's... Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay, Chad.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** That's Chad, by the way.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** Hey, here's... I'm gonna split and go down to the shore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** You want to come?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Later, Chad.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Later, bro.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** Just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:16]** my mic drop bro face and then those chat he was messing with you silly chad silly chad fixer for kids uh okay here's you close the door or chad closes the door do you want to do anything else on your turn um yeah here's this gonna back the fuck up he's gonna get behind these other two doors for now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** Okay, Nico, top of round two.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** It is your turn.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** So Nico's going to look back.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** He's going to look back at Rick.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:27]** He's like, Rick, you want to take a swing at this thing with the melee weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:30]** I would like to stay alive throughout this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** So is that a yes or is that a no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** That's a negative Ghost Rider.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** That's a what?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** So... He doesn't wish that.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** No.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:54]** Nico is gonna... Then he's like, he's gonna look back at everybody's shake and say, you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** And he's just gonna like... Nico's gonna die.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** How much HP do you have?

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:02]** Nico's gonna step over one to the left and he's gonna say...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:18]** rick just open the door and he's gonna he's gonna just ready an action to strike with his dueling sword that he has in his hand oh my god how much hp do you have what are you doing you can probably open the door and move like i'll let you do that like like you could use your swift action just open the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Okay, so Nico's going to use a swift action.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:27]** He's going to open the door just a smidge, and he's going to swing his dueling sword at the gray that's right at the door.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Wait, so are we restarting initiative order?

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** This is the next round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Yeah, it's round two.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** We're in round two.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Yeah, Nico's at the top of the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** And you never answered me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:38]** How much health do you have, Nico?

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Oh, it's not the smartest idea in the world.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** 15 stamina and 7 health.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** So I can take one hit.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** I can take one hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** Yeah, well, Chad went through all that trouble closing it.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Now you're opening it up to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:55]** I'm a little worried, but... I suggest that we pull back and have Chad open the door again.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** That's a good idea.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** And try to take this thing down before it reaches us.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** All right, well, it's Nico's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** So, Nico, it sounds like you already opened the door.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** I'm just saying, I'm sorry.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** I want to let you guys strategize, but it's Nico's turn.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Nico already opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:15]** I have to agree with John as much as I tactically in hindsight believe you guys are right.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** I opened the door.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** You got to stick with what you play.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Damn it.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** You got to stick with what you play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:28]** I'm going to say that you just like punch the console and just overrode any like short opening and just... No, no, no.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** Only a smidge.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Only a smidge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** For truth!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** What am I?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:44]** Now he's just doing it and just like frustration, like, son of a, he's just like, son of a, and he's just gonna go slash it.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:50]** Nick, tell us all about your backup character.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Well, he's like Jeffrey Goldblum, but no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:59]** I did ask today if y'all have major backup characters, so keep that in mind.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Nico, you open the door.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:09]** It opens and this mouth dripping with just gray fluid and these giant fangs.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** I'm going to show it again here on Roll20 so you guys can just see.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** It is fierce.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** And this tail is like whipping in front of you.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** And you take a swing.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Maybe your last one ever.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Maybe my last one ever.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Maybe your last one ever.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:31]** I'm going to say that it probably has... Plus one.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** One on the D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:38]** Would it make sense that with a ranged attack, there would be cover, but with a melee attack, it would be partial cover?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** So it's a little less?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** Because I feel like you might have... Or is it just cover across the board?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:49]** I'm going to do my... I'm going to do my combat... Or no, my combat expertise... Wait, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** It's just cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:55]** It has cover against you, Nico.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** Okay, cool.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Yeah.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Grant option.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:04]** Wait, you're an expert at dealing challenges.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Can I use combat expertise here?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** You make an expertise tag.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Yeah, I can actually.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** I can make a bluff against this character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** Make a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** I'm using social skills to get the upper hand.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** So the bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Just like they taught you in the board rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:35]** So the way this works, again, just in case we haven't, just in case we've forgotten, is prior to your attack roll, attempt a skill check using the chosen skill with the DC equal to 15 plus one to one half your target CR.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:42]** If you succeed at the check and your attack hits, you roll an expertise die, add the result to your damage roll, and the target is shaken for one round.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** Oh, that sounds nice.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** So, all right.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Here we go.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:51]** Here comes Bluff, and he's going to be like, hello, ugly.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** No, no, no.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** That's not what he's going to say.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** He's going to say, hey, you already said it.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** There's no way I'm eating anyone.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Hello, ugly.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Hey, I can see your ding-dong there.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** He's going to attack.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:12]** 18 plus 9.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Wow.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Wow.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** At least you get a good hit in before you die.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** Yeah.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Okay.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:21]** So what you're saying is that I need to make a what check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** With the chosen skill, with the DC equal to 15 plus 1 to 1 half your target CR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Okay.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Cool.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** All right.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** And what am I rolling?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Will?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Reflex?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Fortitude?

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Fortitude.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:38]** I'm doing bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Oh, you need to roll that.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** And you need to roll bluff check.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Oh, and that was 18.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:44]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** You said attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** My bluff was 18 plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** So that's against your CR.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** I thought that was for the attack.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** Yeah, you definitely bluff.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** It looks down at its ding dong.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** And it's like, shit, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:24]** damn it grace grace definitely have gender like that yeah definitely uh so okay and then you're attacked so now it is shaken for at least a round right so um if you see it at the check it's uh okay cool um so this is what happened so it's gonna be shaken for one round

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:30]** but it also adds 1d6 to your damage.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Yeah.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Okay.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** It's shaking for a full round for all of us to hit.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Okay, cool.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** So I get to roll 2d6, I think.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:43]** And I know cover hasn't come into play yet, but I got to roll for my attack now.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:54]** Reading an improved cover, it says in cases when a target is behind a gun port in a defensive wall, cover provides a greater bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** I think it's just regular cuff.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:28]** it's big enough for you guys to like chop through and shoot through it's not improved if it were on the next square up and you all had to lean over to get it maybe that would be improved house 15 against KAC 15 against KAC does not hit dang it this thing because of the cover as you swing down you just misjudged and it hits against the door

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** All right.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Rough.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Rough, but it is shaken, right?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** So it's minus two to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Not bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:42]** So it has... It must be really scared of its own ding dong.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** It's got a minus two to hit you and kill you.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** That's true.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** It does.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** And you have cover against it.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Yep.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:52]** Unseen Servant can still close the door, too.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** That's correct.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Unseen Servant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** And I have cover against it.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** You do have cover against it.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:01]** Did you want to do anything else before you die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Yes, I do.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** Can I take a guarded step back?

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** Sure.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** No, you already used your move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:12]** You did already use five feet of movement to move and your swift action to punch the door to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Yep.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** I'm done with my turn.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Damn, I really wish I hit this thing.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** Rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** I really wish you would think before you... Rough times at Fairmont High.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** All right.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** I don't know if Chad has to wait until the next turn.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:35]** It just says that he can, like, keep, like, repeating the same activity over and over again, but... Hey, just shame on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:40]** Yo, you just want me to, like, push this button over it again?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** Alright.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Hey, Chad.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Yeah, bro, I can do that.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Sure, man.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** We'll get some briskies later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** Yeah.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Some Coors.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** No, some Naturalize, right?

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** Some Natty's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** Yeah.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** You ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** It's the Grey Bounder's turn.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** I think this actually is kind of an important question.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:08]** Can Chad, like, repeatedly do the same activity, or does he have to wait until my turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** I feel like it's on your turn.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Okay.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:14]** That's my gut check.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** What is this spell called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** It's called Unseen Servant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** Unwilling Guardian.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Unseen Servant.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** Standard action.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** Close range.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Duration's one hour.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:33]** The spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** A move action.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]** Can run, fetch, open unstuck doors.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:45]** Servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:45 - 01:01:09]** so i think i think on here just tell it like as a free action right it worked now it's it clearly said on a move action which means kelly has to do is no you give it an order as a move action yeah it orders a move action yeah it doesn't but it can continue to repeat that's what i'm as long as you tell it doesn't say whether it has to wait for my turn amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** I think this should work.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:18]** But it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** So here's the thing.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** It's the if told to do so at your command.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:26]** So I feel like... So you'd have to use your next turn to tell it to continuously push the button.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** I guess I did not technically say that.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** And that's fine, but...

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:35]** I am going to just come down on the fact that, like, probably once per round it will, like, push it.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:38]** Like, because this is all happening at the same time within six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** John's like, come on, guys.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** You got to give me a fair fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** No.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** So the servant can go and close it like it did last time.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Yeah, it can close the door.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** On here's his turn, and it's not the alien's turn.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** Nico's already dead.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** We're assuming I'm going to die.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** I have faith in my life.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:03]** This thing gets two attacks, and it took Rick down, like, 24 points in each attack room or something crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:07]** Right, but here's after the piece is already gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:14]** The way this is going to happen, I'm just predicting Nico's going to die, and then we're going to shut the door and walk away.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** We're just going to live in here for the rest of our lives.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** This is it.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** This is what we got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:20]** Oh, gosh.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** We can make food.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** We can make food.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** If only that were the case.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Nico.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** All right, all right.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:38]** Here's, you said that, like, you know, it can only happen probably on your turn, but you could tell it to, like, do that.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** Maybe you could say it does that whenever somebody comes in and out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:41 - 01:03:05]** i'll look it up i'll look it up for more clarity later but for now i definitely did not tell him to repeat doing that action or whatever so got it okay yeah so we had to wait anyway it's fine so just do it on your turn so nico you cling this thing is shaken you miss you see it disappear for a second from your view nico


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:33]** and as it does you all hear in your heads you hear this like I told you the first time to leave you need to leave and you didn't listen and then its body just moves through the wall into the room that you are in

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:35]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:38]** Oh, man.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** Who called it?

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** There you go.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Stupid great.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** Well, I mean, we've worn it down a bit.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** I feel like.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** Not to mention it had that.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:52]** It also had that damage from the last time, too.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Don't forget that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** It did.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** It did.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Hi there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** This is Will Garrett.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:05]** You've been listening to We'll Save the Podcast, episode 41, entitled Homeward Bounder.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Get it?

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:28]** because Homeward Bound, The Incredible Journey, the remake of the classic 1963 film Incredible Journey, as well as the sequel to the remake, Homeward Bound 2, Lost in San Francisco, are all super relatable movies for you, our listeners, to latch onto and say, oh yeah, I see what you did there.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:41]** Make no mistake, 100% Homeward Bounder is in no way, shape, or form a dated reference to material that is over 20 years old.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:50]** based off of a mediocre children's book that was so well executed and ahead of its time that its author admitted it was never meant to be a children's book.

**[01:04:51 - 01:05:00]** Listen, I'm not saying it's a bad title for an episode, because if it were, I would expect you to go onto our website, find us on social media.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:06]** You'd be banging down the door on Discord, telling us about how bad we are at puns.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:09]** And I've not seen a single complaint.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** about this episode or any episode.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:15]** And here I thought it was bounder to happen.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** See you next time on Wilson.
