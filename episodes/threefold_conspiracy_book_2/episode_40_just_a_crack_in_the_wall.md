## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:04]** Fear.

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:07]** Fear is what lies in this room.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:14]** Rick-19, confronted by a terrorized Belita, struggled to regain control of his own emotions.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:24]** After gaining control of himself, Rick-19 was able to perceive that the fear permeating the room was originating from speakers located in the corners.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:31]** After calling this out, our fire team came into the room one by one to resolve the situation.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:37]** Hears, with some lucky work at the door panel, was able to shut down the speakers and end the fear factor.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:43]** While our group found some release, the only release the Belita found was death.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** What's next for our companions?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Willsave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:48]** you know what i hate what do you hate christmas what ho ho ho

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** Yeah, I'm a Scrooge.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** You're a Scrooge.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Why do you hate Christmas if something happened to you?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** I think you've got to jump right in.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** There's no more context.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:03]** I mean, yeah, who doesn't have a personal tragedy that has happened during Christmas?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:08]** But I mostly hate commercialism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:31]** oh that's that's a fair argument i mean my cousin posted something like two months ago that was christmas trees already in the stores and that's just it's like halloween hadn't even happened yet yeah but halloween was just last week so i know halloween was awesome yeah but like you have to have the holiday the halloween like um you know you have to have the month to buy and set up for halloween


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** True.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** And that was already being invaded by Christmas being taken over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** I should clarify.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:42]** I don't actually hate commercialism because I do like to consume things.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Yeah.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Who doesn't?

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Who doesn't?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** And if you don't like to consume things, write it.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Yeah.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** I'd like to hear it from you.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Yeah.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** But...

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:56]** I think what I disapprove of during Christmas is when people go, like, I don't know.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:10]** I just see, like, so many people trotting on others just to get, you know, like, the Black Friday specials, all the trampling of other people in the spirit of Christmas.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Come on, man.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** They're trampling their bodies and their spirits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Does that still happen?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** I thought everything was just online now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I feel like Cyber Monday is the new Black Friday.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** You just plan for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:25]** People will do anything to save a few bucks.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** That's true.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** It's pretty dumb.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:34]** The pressure to get presents and things is too much.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Spread it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** I think it's still going to be a big thing.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:48]** There's a Best Buy just up the street from where I live, and I'll drive home, and even on non-Black Friday days, I see lines to go in that store going around the block still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** For what?

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** For what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** Seriously, I wish I knew the answer.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Save $200 on a TV.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Yeah, it could be game consoles.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** It could be that.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Game consoles.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** I still want a PS5.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I mean, I do too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** I'm surprised you don't have one yet.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** Oh, you don't really play console games so much, do you, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** I don't because I don't have the latest and greatest because it's too impossible to get one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** But if you played Xbox, you could just have Game Pass and play on your computer or wherever you want.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Yeah, I could do that.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** But then I'd have to give Microsoft more of my money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** As if you don't.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Will, I understand your pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I understand your pain.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** We should say that Will is a Linux guy.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Just want to point that out.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Die hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** I still haven't seen the ad for Linux Pass.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** I make my own games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Yeah, what was Linux share price again?

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** Last I checked, I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Doesn't exist.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Doesn't exist.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** Wow.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:55]** Unless you count Red Hat or any countless other thousands of companies that Linux supports.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** That's true.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Probably the stock exchange itself.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Yeah, that's probably true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** That's probably very true.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** Thanks, Linux.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Thanks, Linux.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** We're a pro Linux podcast.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** One of the few.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:17]** You realize this is our first holiday season as a podcast, and this is what we're talking about, being pro-Linux and how we hate commercialism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:24]** We're being pro around Christmas time, being pro some organization that won't give us money to rep them either.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** But there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** What, Linux won't sponsor us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** It's too Microsoft to talk about how we don't have PS5s.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:39]** I will gladly tell people to line up around the block to buy your things if you want to sponsor us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** Does Linux sell Linux machines, or do you just buy a computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** No, you buy it from other companies that sell them.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** Someone was making a Linux phone at one point.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** Just like, does Microsoft make machines?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** I guess they make the Surface, right?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Yeah.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** Hey, I am a proud user of the Surface Book 2.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:02]** And he has the most technical problems on this podcast.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** Yes, he does.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** Actually, that is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Oh, wow.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** That's good.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Bye-bye Microsoft sponsorship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:21]** That just reminded me of the time that Nick sent a binary file in Slack or something like that.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** That was a funny day.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** We're like, we don't even know how that's possible.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** That's just Surface.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Of course he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:37]** So in general, I'm getting the feeling that we are kind of lukewarm on the whole holiday season.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** I like it.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:42]** I like it for the other things.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Not for the vest.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Yeah, anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** I do enjoy snow.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** And I now live in an area that has snow.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** You do.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** You are the only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Yeah.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** You're going to have to send us a bunch of pics of you in the snow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** The lowlands of Maryland.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** The lowlands?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** The marshes of Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Aren't we all?

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** Are there mountains down over there to ski on and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:13]** On the west side, but then you move into different states like West Virginia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** West Virginia has the Appalachia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Yeah, which is beautiful.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** Maryland stops at the mountains, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** Shout out to any fans who listen in West Virginia.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** We call them hills out here in California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** That's one of the big things I miss about California is always having a mountain in the backdrop.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** It's definitely not a thing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** But you do realize there's some snowy fucking mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:39]** The Appalachians are so much older than the mountains out here in California.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Yeah, they've eroded.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** That's why they're so low.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:08:00]** apparently so you're with the ogs apparently like the appalachia like were connected way back in pangea days to like some mountains in uh scotland and some other things like they were once all the same range yeah a long time ago it's very old


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** Get your flat-earth theories out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** I wish that we could just be back in the Pangea days.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Hashtag one continent.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** There's just dinosaurs going around like... Before there was any heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** That's what we're trying to record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** Yeah, before there was all this continent... Before we were all divided.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Yeah, we were divided.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** When that thing was everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** The continental divide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** Giant fucking caterpillars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Come on, I was working up to that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:48]** then i'll divide the kind of divide yeah yeah it was good it divided us i'll give it to you no i've been there i don't think it's punishment worthy uh i wasn't going for a punishment i was just going for a bad joke do you not shoot for the stars kev aim for the moon because then you're guaranteed to hit the stars yeah or you'll just miss entirely and go into orbit around earth which is what you did with that joke so it's fine just floating out there recognize the joke


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** SpaceX joke or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I don't know.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** It just keeps going.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** Yeah, just like your joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** In orbit.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** In orbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** One day we'll know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** We're down river, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:11]** Did you guys hear about the message in a bottle that was found off the coast of Hawaii that was thrown in the water in Japan 40 years ago or something?

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** No.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** What did it say?

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** I think... I don't know.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** I didn't really read about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** If you find this, email me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** 40 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:25]** So what, like the 70s?

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Or the 80s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** They knew I was old because it was a hotmail email address.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** Here's my fax number.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Here's my AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** People still fax.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:37]** Please message me on ICQ.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** People still use faxes in the medical sector as well.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Military and medical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Because those are HIPAA compliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:50]** HIPAA compliant and they're secure forms of transmitting messages.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I don't even know how to fax.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** If somebody was like, you need to fax this or else I'm going to shoot you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** You have to have a cover page and you have to know the phone number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Wait, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Because if you're faxing confidential information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** It has to say confidential information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** Well, the cover page covers up any of the confidential information.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** It comes up first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Wow.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** It's also just, I think, protocol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** So, okay.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** But it's not like faxes aren't encrypted, are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:21]** I think they technically... They're not hacked.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** They're not enabled to be hacked, I don't think, because it's over the phone line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** Oh, that's a big deal, I guess.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** But you could wiretap somebody and receive the same fax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:30]** I don't know, man.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** I'm not a hacker.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** It's your guys' domain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:39]** Or I could probably hit the print header or something and scrape it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** I don't even know what that means.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** What language are you talking?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Linux?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I'm just talking OPSEC.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I don't know.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** So, sounds like we're all pro-holiday.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** This is good.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, Christmas.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** This is good.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** This is a great intro.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Because this is Christmas.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** Christmas, Thanksgiving, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** Guys out there, let us know what your favorite holiday is, okay?

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** And tweet us or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Also, let us know if you still use a fax machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** Fax us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Fax us.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Please teach us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** Please teach Kelly to use a fax machine.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Yeah, actually, yeah, please do.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:24]** I have that problem too, but I just send it on, I think like sendafax.com works.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** What?

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** Where you use an email and it automatically faxes it for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Can we get sponsored by CinderFacts?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Oh my god.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** I didn't notice anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** CinderFacts, send me the memes you really mean.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** Will you please send my message home to me?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** Oh, all I want.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Did you just write this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** He'll write a theme, a holiday theme for you.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:49]** Nick Belcher will compose a jingle for your company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:54]** That was All I Want for Christmas by Mariah Carey, bastardized for fax machines.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** But you just did that, though, off the top of your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** You just did that.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** That was glorious, dude.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** That was really good.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Do it again.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** That was great.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Props.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Props.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** I'm ecstatic about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** I'm more than ecstatic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:12]** So to slow that down, it was, say you'll send the facts of the memes you really mean.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** Will you please send a message home to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Sounds like a 90s commercial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:21]** That sounds like you have an advertisement.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** You just need an advertiser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:31]** I think if and when we were ever to do ads here on the podcast, it would just be you singing the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:35]** I mean, actually, it would have to come at a premium.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Absolutely.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** To be honest.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Yeah.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Because when you have talent.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** Anyone can pay me to, you know, shill.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** But Nick sings for free.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** But that's the point.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** He sings.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** You shouldn't.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** He just put me off.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** Nick, that wasn't a bad thing.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** That was just, you just sing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** I mean, I sing for free, but I mean, I should charge because I'm that good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** You should charge.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** You absolutely should.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** It's almost like you should be a professional singer or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** Yeah.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** You're like golden, man.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** It's like you trained or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Yeah.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Did you go to school?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Did you go to Berklee School of Music?

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Oh, no, Will.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** No, no, no.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** That was a joke.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** That was a bad joke.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** Even I'm going to just step in here.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** That was a bad joke.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** The rest are going to step in.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** It was a bad joke.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** No, no.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:28]** It's supposed to be funny because I mentioned it before in an episode.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** You did.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** And we probably got mad at you then, too.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** We probably got mad then, too.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Three out of five of us went to a real school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Yeah.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** With a real football team and a real football coach.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** Yeah, let's not talk about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Kevin, is that what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** This whole season, it's been terrible.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Moving on.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Carry on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** You know what we should do?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** We should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Let's play.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Let's play.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Yeah.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** I stole your line.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Sorry, John.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** That was your line.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Wait, no.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** You didn't steal my line.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** It's cool.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** I'll just send you a fax with an insult.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:07]** So let's do one of those things that we in the industry call a recap.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Take it back.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Think about, thank you.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** That was good.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** That was good.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** That was a little late, but it was good.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** It was like you faxed it to me.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:31]** So I want to say that last week we found our passengers rested and

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** and recovered.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:52]** The toil of several dangerous encounters, including a skirmish with a feral alien known as a Grey Bounder who forced you into retreat, all of this wore down your bodies and your minds.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** So you decided to explore other doors, hoping to find out more about

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:02]** Find out more clues about the crumbling environment all around you.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:06]** Instead, danger appears to wait around every corner.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:17]** As first you find a ferrofluid magnetic ooze, this technological creature, a byproduct of toxic industrial environments and chemicals.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:24]** First, that was quickly melted away by you, our fresh-faced passengers.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:31]** But what you found next, however, was equally, if not more disturbing.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:46]** A room containing an experimental fear technique that transmits low frequency sound or infrasound to elicit uncertainty, fear and dread in any who hear it.

**[00:15:46 - 00:16:00]** And unfortunately, a bleeding that had been trapped there and felt compelled by the frequency attacks you, all the while pleading and begging you to make it stop.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:08]** And you shut off the frequency, and she collapses to the floor.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:27]** And as you all begin to explore the room, Rick19, you went to check on her, and she has just enough energy to say that she'll never make it back as her eyes roll back in her head.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:39]** And she finally, perhaps for the first time in a long time, feels peace as she passes in your arms.

**[00:16:39 - 00:17:04]** so rick what are you thinking the four of you are in this room i'll go to roll 20 and bring you guys over nick is smiling i feel like you enjoyed that moment get out of here rude no rick is like devastated like he he he recognized from the very beginning of like entering this room and like the responses and just like the interactions he recognized that this wasn't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** an active hostile.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:09]** They were being forced to do this.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** And we corrected it.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** We turned off the sound.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** And then she died in his arms as he's trying to save her.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** And I think he's devastated by that.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:25]** It's never easy to watch somebody die, especially somebody who's innocent.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Okay.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:35]** Yeah, not what I expected to hear from you, but I'm glad that you felt that way about this passing centipede thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** I believe here is you were going, Dr. O'Keefe, first you went over to the computers to see if you could find out anything more about it.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** I think here is you went over there too.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:53]** Nico, you were going to destroy the loudspeakers that were emitting this frequency.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:57]** There's no threat from these loudspeakers.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:04]** And there's a dead Boletan in front of Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:15]** Can I do like a knowledge check of some sort to be a pride culture to know where Boletas are like from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** And I'm going to ask Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** about it because he's within earshot.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** Dr.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:33]** O.K., do you happen to know where bolitas are?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** What is the word for it?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** I'm running a blank.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Their origin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** Yeah, their natural habitats.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Yeah, mm-hmm.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:45]** That's Kevin speaking, not Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Yes.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:54]** I will probably have to roll some sort of roll to try and understand that question, Robit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** I think you guys did that last time, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** Not to know where they're from.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** Okay.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:06]** I rolled a 20 with a plus two on culture, so 22 to know what planet is their origins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** What planet are they from?

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** They are from the Belita's home.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** The Belita's home planet is called Zephyga.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:23]** And they were only really, I think, discovered probably a few decades ago.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:42]** And they are considered minors, again, because they have these, like, there are arthropodding creatures with this, like, chitinous body that look like, what would you say, like a, maybe like a centipede, but then like a centaur centipede?

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** Because their upper body is, like, vertical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** I mean, she looked menacing, like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Yeah, centipede-like, kind of.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** But their plates are like metal and they cover their whole body.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:59]** And they, yeah, they mine and they can go deep into planets.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** And their home planet is the Fyga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Are they playable characters?

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Because that's going to be my backup character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I think they are.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** They are playable characters.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** There's no reason why you can't be a Bolita.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:12]** Sounds something I don't want to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Yes, what he said.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:17]** Also, one thing I like this line in their thing in the Alien Archive, too.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** Digging is a euphoric activity for bolitas.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:29]** And they spend a large portion of their lives creating new tunnels and caves to house their ever-expanding populations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** Well, Rick was going to try to find some kind of, like...

**[00:20:33 - 00:21:01]** item on on this poor belita and try to take it back to the home world but he doesn't plan on going down the mines anytime soon so he's just gonna perform like a last rites close her eyes and let her lay there are you okay no seriously yeah rick is gonna do almost like he's gonna like cross her arms over lay her weapon down beside her and almost put her out in like a ceremonial like she's a victim of this she's not just another monster we ran into


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** What?

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** Oh, my God.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** 18 on the die.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** And a plus six.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** That's 24 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** 24.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** That's a really great perception.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** You get the sense they're...

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:27]** Their heads are armored in the front, like in their forehead and then going back.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:34]** But there's a part of it where on the side where it's unarmored because they have these antennae that are coming up.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** And you can tell that there's something.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** It's like something went off in their head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Like with the greys earlier.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** Okay.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Yeah.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:52]** Or maybe something was implanted there and it's some sort of constraint.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Did we cover... Is there any evidence of that?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:57]** Could we, like, examine the body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:04]** If you wanted to do a medicine check, I can say that with the right role, you could confirm whether you think that's the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** As Rick is doing it, he turns to Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:12]** Dr. O'Kane, it appears as if something happened to this Bolita as well.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** Can you please investigate it further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Yes.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** I... Yes.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** I see.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** I rolled an 18 plus 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** I'll support.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** That's awesome.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** I support.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** You can't aid if you're not trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** I am trained in medicine now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** That's right.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** You are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:37]** I ran a medicine check on her last time and you told me I wasn't good enough.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** That's true.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:41]** I scored really good on that medicine check too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** You are certain, Dr.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** O.K.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:48]** I'm really sad about this Belita dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** You are certain, Dr.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:53]** O.K., that there was some sort of cortex bomb?

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:02]** Given that this Belita, she was in this room where there's testing going on, probably something done by the Greys.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** And that's what ultimately killed her.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** And I get why you're sad, Kip.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:13]** This is the first individual, especially since leaving the Chimera, right?

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Because people died on the Chimera.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** And you're like, what the hell is going on?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** Then now that you've come out, this is the first being that you've met that is, one, not actually aggressive.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:32]** And two, is kind of like you in a way.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Can I do?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** They don't know what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:41]** Can I do like a retroactive medicine check to see if everybody on the Chimera that just passed out randomly at the end died from the same cortex bomb?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** Like Lozu and the pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:56]** Also, Nico wants to ask Dr. OK if he's able to do a scan of our bodies to see if we have any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:58]** I perhaps could tune my custom micro lab.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** I don't know, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Yeah, I'd love to do that.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** Give me a roll.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Give me a wisdom check, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** A wisdom check?

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** I don't know if I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** Rick and... Rick and... Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** I don't have any wisdoms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** You have zero wisdom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** I have zero wisdom, yeah.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** I have a seven for that.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Seven for that.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** One moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Here's.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Twelve.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:23]** Twelve.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:28]** Okay.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** You... Rick...

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:46]** you're not quite sure, but here's this like the way maybe right as this bleeding died, here's you, although you're across the room, all the lights are on in here, right?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** So you look across the room and you were able to watch the bleeding die.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:59]** And the way that the bleeding eyes rolled back into her head reminds you of the way that, for instance, exactly.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** Low superhero's eyes rolled back in her head.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** So 12 is not enough to confirm, but you can link something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** You don't have anything saying it's not the case.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** I mean, what is this?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** I guess this bleed is from, I don't know.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** Maybe this wasn't grown in a bad year, though.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** Like it was literally like taken here, I'm guessing.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Yeah.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Well, I think it's got to be the same.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** So here's tells that to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:34]** that the way that this guy died looks a lot like how everyone else died on the Chimera.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Reminds me about how Lozu died.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Eyes rolling in the back of her head before collapsing.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** etc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** Now that you say that, I remember that as well.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** It did look quite familiar.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** I wish we had time to go back and investigate.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** I wish we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** That's another rumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Oh, well.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Oh, well.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Let's get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Fuck it.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** I still want to rent.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** I don't want to stay in this hellhole any longer.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** We already got off all the information we could from these computers, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:12]** Like, we tried to scrape info, and it was... Wait, wait, before we go any further, we have to think about this.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** Is it possible that we have these same cortex bombs located in our spines?

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** That was like an open question to all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:25]** I don't know if I can check for that, but I can try, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:34]** I feel like you can, because you have both your chemilizer and... Describe to me the exact equipment that you have.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** You've got your med kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:51]** I have medical supplies, testing materials, pharmaceutical compounds, and equipment to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks described below.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:57]** Um, do all kinds of stuff like med kit, chemilizer.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** That's probably like the two big ones.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** So like the chemilizer, that's what I thought.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** It's like a wand tipped with a nozzle for sampling different chemicals.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:19]** So I could like trace maybe like chemical alloys and like whatever's, you know, in that cavity to see if there's common, maybe I could probe us.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:48]** do you have any type of like i don't know magnetic do you have any type of mri capability in that part of the custom micro lab also allows for attunement to other creatures and individuals like i can readily identify let's see tune your micro lab to creatures in excess of this number once attuned i can inject you guys like i can deliver drugs directly to you without um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:48 - 00:28:13]** having to make a roll for it but how does that search for a bomb in her own head so i would feel like i could be able to sample through that same process right yeah my thought is maybe that if you had something that could scan then that's the first way just like nico was saying right if you had some sort of mri that's that's that's the best way you just get an image of your body and

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** And the other way would be, yeah, that you sample.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:25]** And what I would maybe say is that you would have to take time, either like an hour or something to try and like work through and just make a roll.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** I wouldn't make it super hard.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** But the point is that you have to do the research to see if you can pull anything out.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** From that blood sample.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Yeah.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:40]** So I tell Rick and the others, like, I could start working right away on this, but it will take some time.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:45]** And, you know, science isn't always exact in the sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** I still have that laser drill if you need to use that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I always need a laser drill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:57]** Nico's also going to suggest, and before he does it, he wants to ask the Game Master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Nico asks the Game Master?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:04]** Nico lifts his head to the sky and shouts.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Oh, Game Master!

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** Nico is praying to some foreign god.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Guys, what is Nico doing?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:18]** I'm asking John here, with the parts that I've accrued and with the combination of Dr. OK's custom micro lab,

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:27]** Could they kind of fabricate some sort of primitive MRI device that might be able to scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** I don't think you could do that within like the course of an hour.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** I think you would.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** Could we do that over the course of a couple?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:41]** I mean, it makes more sense to try and do an ultrasound in that case with like with the speakers that are found here in this room.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** But we could do that.

**[00:29:43 - 00:30:01]** If you guys want to do that, I'm going to... I think we try to just do the attunement route or try to find some equipment here that might be able to help us know whether or not who's at the control of these devices, setting them off.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:10]** Is it a remote operator or is it somebody programmed them to go off if certain conditions are met?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Oh, there was a camera.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** But, yeah, Rick will say that out loud.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:19]** Like, if you guys don't have the capability now, we should just keep our eyes open and keep moving.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** This place is about to collapse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Agreed.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Let's try to do that later.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** You need help getting that out of that head, Doctor, okay?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** That sample.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:39]** I think I've... Could I... John, GM, almighty GM, could you tell us, can I sample and take it to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Yeah.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Cut her head off.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:48]** Nico wants to see whatever he can scavenge from a technology standpoint from the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Okay.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:57]** So, Dr. K, you're going to sample the bleeding or each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:07]** The cavity where I believe the device that caused the explosion within the head

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:31]** I want to do tissue samples from various parts that I think are biased for that chemical, and then I'm going to sample parts that I think are liver, kidney, thigh tissue, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** If you want to do a full one, I'm going to say it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Just picking up two sets of samples.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:43]** OK, one from the infection site and one from the rest of the body to see if there's like I can isolate.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** And then later on, I will try to isolate those from us.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:58]** If you know, I'm trying to detect trace elements of something that I don't know exists that exploded in somebody's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:13]** I think it's pretty easy to use your tools, but as you go up and this massive creature is on the ground, I mean, they're not large, but they are a big arthropod and creature.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:29]** And so it must... I don't know if you're doing this dispassionately or if you're like, I'm really sorry, but you are able to kind of... I make a solemn prayer to my deity

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:56]** yara isa and i approach and i with all the respect i seek to understand the knowledge so that i may keep this horror from other people yeah it feels like it feels like when you're like hunting and you use all parts of the animal it's like you're you're just not that i believe it is an animal but this same mentality of like this is like meant to to like their death uh helps you out it's not in vain


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Before I forget, is that spear... Can you tell us what that spear is?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** Is it better than my tactical axe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Is it better than your tactical axe?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** It is a... A tactical pike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:16]** Is that better than your... I gotta look it up, but... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** I don't have the stats in front of me right now.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** Advanced or... I guess it is advanced.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Just a tactical...

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** That's probably the base one, whatever that is.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** Oh, tactical.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** So, Dr.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** O.K., you do go up.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** You are able to reach and feel.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** You're kind of maybe grimacing or maybe not.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** You're a trained professional, so maybe not.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:44]** You are able to kind of move some of the chitinous plate out of the way or at least get your...

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:59]** like analyzer in there pull yeah pull up some tissue from the back of her head and then you are able to find a soft spot maybe on the rest of her body and pull up another tissue and put that in a vial

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:07]** Well, so, Nico, you are looking for material.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:15]** I will say that what I texted you earlier about, I think I had said that it was like, what did I say?

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** It was about 25 UPBs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Plus some gold and silver wiring.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** It was, hold on, let me read it exactly.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:28]** 25 UPBs as well as 25 credits of gold and silver wires that together weigh about one bulk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** Yeah, they probably don't weigh about one bulk because I'm realizing that one bulk is a lot.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:41]** So I probably, it wouldn't be one bulk, but given everything that you have picked up already, that might start to be totaling around one bulk.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** So it's not a lot, but you are able to pull a little bit of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:52]** Okay, so while they're clearing out the room, Rick looks back and just says, I'm going to start moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** Yes, I think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** And there's no other way out of this room, right?

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** There's only one door?

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** Correct.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Okay.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:08]** So, yeah, he's going to head back into the hallway and kind of just, like, scan the hallway while they're working on their stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:16]** Nico's going to kind of have his back up to the wall and by the door with his pistol kind of facing toward the ceiling and his sword kind of by his side while watching everybody go out the room.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Okay.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** Just kind of bringing up the rear.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Yeah, so...

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:32]** You all walk out back into the hallway where there's just a puddle on the floor where that ferrofluid ooze was.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** It's a little sticky, kind of burnt.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** The air smells like burned plastic a little bit.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** It's not a very great odor.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:49]** And you all start to... There's still the door to your right, if you're looking in the hallway.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** There's a door on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** Yeah, so there were three doors.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** The one we came from, the one we just came out of.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Those are across the hall from each other.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:01]** And there's a third door on the same side as the room we just came out of.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:07]** And so Rick is going to head over and kind of wait for them when he's ready.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:13]** And he's going to pull out his azimuth laser, artillery laser for this one.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Did you take the tactical pike?

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** No.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** It's only a 1d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:24]** Dr. Okay, if you have proficiency with melee weapons, that wouldn't be the worst weapon for you, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:32]** Dr. Okay, you probably should take it if you have advanced melee, because it also has a plus 10... It's a 10-foot reach, so you can be two squares away instead of one.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** It's pretty good for attacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** I don't believe that I have advanced melee.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Do you take it, Dr. Okay?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Uh...

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** I don't know if I could wield such a weapon.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** I don't think I have advanced melee proficiency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Double check, make sure it's advanced.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:56]** I thought it was when I looked, but I'd have to dig deeper, and I don't personally care to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** Alright, so you guys walk up to the door.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** It looks like

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:24]** rick is at the door here's nico and dr okay you're standing a little ways away but you're ready to see what happens here are they yep okay i'm gonna stand right there and if they're all ready then rick's gonna push the button and hold his gun up okay uh you walk up

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:51]** walking away from i i can imagine it must be a little odd to walk away from this creature that died and then you left it there and you just have to move on so as you step forward press the button the door opens and your view of this room

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:05]** is dominated by a jagged crack that splits the northern wall and extends onto the floor and onto the ceiling.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:12]** And as soon as you open the door, this rush of air, you feel like the air is frigid cold.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:18]** There's pale ice that fills this crack in the wall.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** The wall looks like a...

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:25]** like a demonic grin full of flat, serrated, icy teeth.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:47]** What's weird is that there are bolts, mounts, wires hanging from the ceiling and the wall that show where objects might have once been, but in all other ways, the room is completely empty, and I will reveal it.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:58]** There's one light in the northern left corner, one purple light that just barely casts out any light.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:04]** But in general, it's just an empty, frigid, cold room with this crack in the middle of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** I'm going to do perception test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I'll do that with you, Kev.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:15]** 13 plus 6 is a 19.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** 13 plus 7 is 20.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** 19, 20.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Here's... 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** Here's... You got what, sorry?

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** 15.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** 15.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** It looks like...

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** It looks like everything that you see in the room appears totally empty.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:43]** There's one dim light and just a giant crack filled with this pale ice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:48]** You're a giant crack filled with pale ice, John.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** It's like music.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** So I step into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Does a 27 give me anything?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Sorry, Doctor.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Okay, what?

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Does a 27 give me anything?

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:05]** You don't see anything more than what they see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** Rick's in the room, so whatever happens, happens now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Yeah, Rick's already in the room.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Okay.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** Is there any indication?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:21]** Is it from this destruction, or is it from all the shaking and rumbles?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** Give me an engineering or physical science question.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:30]** Or if any of you have a profession that maybe would help with that.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** I have a 20 on engineering.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** I have engineering as well.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** 20 from Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** I assist with a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** I have a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:45]** All right.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** That is a 16 plus nine.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** That's 25 on my engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Okay.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** So everybody but Rick.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Rick, you think that this is just a cool part of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Whoa, look at that giant crack.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** That's cool.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** That's huge.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** That's crazy.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** It kind of looks like a butt crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** You should stay away from that crack, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:12]** You think that this crack came from some sort of damage.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:21]** It's likely the case that this damage and the source of this damage is external damage.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** out beyond whatever is on the other side of this wall.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:33]** And whatever happened, it blew through and whatever was here was pulled through the crack.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:41]** And the crack is both ice and you think maybe some sort of emergency sealant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** I don't think we should remain in this room.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:52]** Perhaps we should back out and lock it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Not so fast there, Doctor.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** Okay, I think we should investigate the room, maybe see if there's another way through.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:04]** So far as we've seen, there isn't another door to go to any other part of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** Wait, wait, this is something I wanted to point out.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:13]** I forgot, and I just didn't bring it up earlier, was the whole thing with that feral bounder.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** He said that was an airlock door.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:22]** So we still don't know where we are, if we're on a planet or a spaceship or an asteroid.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** We don't know.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:28]** But the room that the airbounder was in was technically an airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** And then there was a door on the other side of that room.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** There was another door in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Yeah, so it was like an airlock chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** Right, but I was saying for Nick, because Nick was like, there's no other door.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** I was like, there was a door there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Oh no, that's the only way out we know of so far.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:47]** We went through every other door except for this room and that airlock.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** So we're going to have to go fight that bounder at some point is what it seems like.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** Unless we melt this crack and go through this way.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** That's probably not a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** I think it would decompress this.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** I guess we have suits, but... I'm of the mind with Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** I don't think we should melt the crack here.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** I think we should... I think that would cause a decompression blast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Yeah.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** I would concur with that.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:15]** Can I see the end of this wall here, since I do have darkvision?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** It's just covered in shadows on my Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** It's just a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** So there's nothing else significant in this room except for the giant crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:34]** You just walked out, but give me a either... Just technically, I never got in.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:40]** I just let Dr. OK get through if he needed to, in case that's relevant to what you're going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:45]** I was going to have somebody give me either mysticism check or since you cast magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** My mysticism is good.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** I'll do it.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** So I'm a mystic.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** Well, it's just a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:57]** Maybe you felt it with the rush of frigid air then.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** So give me a mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:01]** I'm going to roll intimidation on the ice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:27]** roll intimidation on the ice 16 i also have to tell you magic i can i'm going to use uh my life science uh to identify by mysticism nico's okay nico wants to take a look to see if there's any technology in the room any type of computers cameras anything okay so let's go one by one uh let's start with rick you intimidated the ice what do you say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:31]** Yeah, he just points the laser and he, like, pulls the trigger just enough to, like, charge it up.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** And he's like, you better tell these guys everything you know.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Please.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I rolled a 17 on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** There's a little mouth there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Tomorrow's my daughter's quinceanera.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Please, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Rick 19 is such a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** Rick is going insane.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Yeah, pretty much.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** He's lost it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Yeah, so Rick's going insane.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Yep.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Dr.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** O.K., you do compression.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:10]** I use my pious scientist ability, praying once again to Yari's...

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:17]** To identify something normally identified by mysticism, I can use life science.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** That's neat.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Yep.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:24]** So I rolled a 16, plus my life science is 13 for 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** And here's what you get on yours.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** 17, I think.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** 17.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** And Nico, what was your perception check?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Perception check...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** That's not very good.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** That's a one plus whatever is seven.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** That's an eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** You don't need much to know that this room is empty.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** There's nothing.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** All right.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** There's nothing.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** There's nothing that remains.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:59]** Here's maybe as the door opened again, you felt it with the frigid air and you didn't think about it, except as soon as your mind locked onto it.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** It's like a...

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:04]** it's like a scent that you're like, Oh, I definitely know.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I definitely recognize this.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** And I'm trying to think Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:11]** Of how you might feel this.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:18]** Maybe it's like you, I'm trying to think of a way to, to tie in the pious scientist with like the mysticism check here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:34]** My deity speaks to me in a spirit that informs my intellect how to proceed and what I should look into and what clues I can identify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:41]** So maybe as you're praying, this chill comes over you that's not from the frigid air.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:48]** And both of you, I think, independently realize that there was magic in here.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** There's a faint aura, if you would cast detect magic.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Here's.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:56]** There's a faint aura of extra planar magic.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:04]** And that extra planar magic is tainted with supernatural evil.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:15]** And Dr. O'Kane, as soon as you feel that, because you succeeded so well on your DC, you know that the energy here is abyssal in nature.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:24]** It's probably that something demonic was once right here in this room and now is gone.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** This, this is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Something evil happened.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:37]** has been here to cause this, to wield it somehow.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** I don't know, but something dark and evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** Can we just review what you guys found on that computer in the beginning?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:52]** One room was for infrasonic weapons.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** Another room was transmorphic weapons.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** Could this room be the demonic weapons they're talking about?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:09]** Did they possibly interact with a demonic side and cause the destruction of their own laboratories?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:14]** It's certainly a possibility, though it did say on the system that they were only partially successful.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:24]** Also, I'd like to point out that it's been my experience that evil is known as an action, not an alignment.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Maybe... Hashtag liabilities.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** Hashtag liabilities.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** What makes you say this was evil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:46]** I will jump in here and just tell you that, not to disprove your theory, but it's just in the sense that, like, technically, the creature is evil.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** Like, it is an evil creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:55]** He'll be like, as a magic user, there are really, truly things that are evil by nature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:01]** And he's also just going to do, detect magic real quick, just to see if he can, because I think he can figure out a certain spell.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Yeah, Nico.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** You may not be evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** You're just a bad person.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Pfft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:31]** it just does bad things thanks rick 19. i just go by what people want and what i want and make sure it aligns but what we are talking about here is truly demonic and the grays were messing with this what what they want is destruction for everything we don't know that we don't know what they want we haven't talked to one of these things yet no that's that is their nature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** John, I cast detect magic.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Can I find anything else besides this?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** What you just said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** You don't know too much other than that.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:44]** Obviously, there's some sort of hybrid of science and magic going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:44]** Okay.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:48]** Well, I guess from this role, I might now know that it's abyssal without having to ask Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Right.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Yeah.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** You would know right from without having to ask Dr. Okay.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:59]** I'll also say that, you know, from everything you said before, it's like you weren't entirely successful.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** Yeah.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** But something did happen here.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:08]** We talked before about how there were a lot of iterations of things, and then something happened.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Okay.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** And whatever's here is probably that something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:19]** Is there anything in the room, any kind of text on the walls, or any notebooks laying around?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** Because two of us speak Aklo, so we would at least be able to understand...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:27]** I can read Abyssal, actually, but I don't think there's anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** That's awesome.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** No, there's nothing in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:36]** Nico's going to ask the group, like, what is this Abyssal?

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:42]** I don't have a lot of faith as part of a religious background here.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** I don't even know if I'm...

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** truly believe in these parlor tricks.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** Like, you guys say it's abyssal.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:52]** Like, it's just some fundamental law of the universe that something is evil.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Explain this to me.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** I've just found that people act according to their nature and wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** Abyssal is a demonic nature.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** There are creatures from it.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** They're chaotic.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** They're evil.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** They're from a place called the abyss.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** What do they want?

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Depends on the one.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** They're really selfish.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:17]** And they just want to cause harm, like psychopaths, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Death.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** They want everything to be like their pit of death.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** And what is in the abyss?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** I don't want to find out.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Suffering.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** If you guys are right, then we probably will.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** Let's might as well hash it out now.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:37]** We got to know our enemy first, if they are our enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:43]** He's doing an internet check, but he can't determine anything.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** This is going tangential.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:50]** Nico is going to do kind of like a culture check just to kind of see what the short story, any kind of tall tales.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** In his mind, they would be tall tales.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** He might have heard about this.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:58]** But it wouldn't be tall tale, would it, John?

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:07]** I'm saying Nico's perception with that, he would interpret them as tall tales.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** It would be like a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:16]** If he was a sheltered kid raised within a society that didn't believe in the supernatural, then it's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** That's a 22 for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** 22 for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** I will also do that.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Yeah, can I roll to culture also?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** Sure, that's fine.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** 18.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** I was going to say 24.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:51]** Maybe on something that would be akin to an All Saints Day or something that was trying to tie people and corporations and governments that people wanted to call perverse, then they would invoke the Abyss.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** Because the Abyss is...

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** It's a plane.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:06]** It's a layered plane that starts as like giant canyons and yawning chasms in the fabric of some of the outer planes.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** And it's just a perversion of freedom.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:15]** It's like a nightmare realm with demons as well as some of the oldest beings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:27]** Niko's gonna kind of relay that to the rest of the group and like, the stories I heard were of demons and ancient beings older than the universe itself.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:31]** Things that any rational person would- couldn't possibly believe.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Doesn't make sense.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** It doesn't- it doesn't add up.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Just because you haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:45]** Also, some people, like, we know of people who have seen these things, right?

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Okay, personally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** I've met quite a few people.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** I haven't met anybody who does that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Like, in the Starfinder universe.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Yeah, but, like, Nico might not have.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** You've got to keep that in perspective.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** You could, like, buy artifacts from, like, the abyss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:05]** There are things like... There's something called a fever stone or abyssium, which is, like, a radioactive metal that...

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:13]** it is basically, you can trade the connection between the material plane and the abyss.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** It's like saying Japan doesn't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** No, but think about Nico's perspective.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:25]** He was raised as a single child as part of this corporation that they could buy anything and everything.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:31]** So to him, none of it has real... It's not real, right?

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:43]** It would be like somebody today being super rich and then buying, I don't know, the Ten Commandments on stone and just thinking, yeah, they're just rocks and they're cool artifacts of the history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:43 - 00:55:05]** you know what i mean like it's it's it's it's a um cognitive dissonance going on in his world yeah like he doesn't realize he doesn't realize exactly engage with cognitive dissonance as a character say again like if you're not if you're not present i can't i can't it's i can't i don't know where to begin and then he walks off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** That's a valid argument.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** And then he walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:16]** But Rick will put his hand on his shoulder and be like, I understand where you're coming from.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** I have not experienced anything beyond what we have here.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** I could see where you would see fallacy in the things in front of you.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** And he just kind of squeezes and walks off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:35]** For all of you, this might be the first time that you're in a place where it would be like us as a group walking in some place and being like, oh, there's a demonic ritual going on here.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Cool.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** I knew that that happened, but now I'm here.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** I'm literally here.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:45]** It's like when you go to any major historic site and you're like, this is where it happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** It's like ghosts.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** We all know ghosts exist, but none of you have experienced it but me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** Well, I don't know if they do exist.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** That was a joke.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** That was subtle.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:03]** Yeah, because Kevin just has a host of really cool ghost stories, but thanks for flexing with your ghost stories.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** Guilty as charged with ghost stories.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Yeah.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Sorry we haven't experienced horrible shit like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** Nico's just kind of... Everyone else is going to leave the room first.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:24]** Nico's just going to be kind of... He's going to look around the room a little bit kind of in disbelief, but he also can't shake what he's seeing either.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:33]** So he's going to take a deep exhalation and he's going to put his pistol up in the air and grip his sword just a little bit tighter.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Just a little bit tighter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:40]** And as he breathes out, he sees a fog coming out of his mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** I like that too.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** I like that, Kev.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Thanks for that.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** That was really good, actually.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** I mean that sincerely.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** Yeah, that's a cool image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:51]** This is a cold place.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:54]** And Nico is just going to, he's also going to think about what Rick said.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** And he's going to think about the action too.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:03]** And the first thought was, that was an oddly human thing for an android to do.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:12]** And he's just going to take a note of that and move on.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** But it's something that he's made an observation of.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Okay.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** So what do you guys want to do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** You all walk out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Rick's going to discuss with the group.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:33]** As soon as Nico comes out of the room, the four of us are together, he's going to just say, there's only one path forward, and it's through that monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** I think we're ready this time.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Yes.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** Nika's going to be like, told you we'd have to fight him.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** No one disagreed.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** We fight on our terms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:49]** Well, you already agreed to go first, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:56]** And just to be clear, the way through that boundary is the only door left.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** We don't have any other options here.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** We didn't miss any other hallways or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:04]** You're fairly confident there's no other way out.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Nico's going to pause.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Nico's going to hold the group here.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** He's like, guys, we need a strategy.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** And he's going to say...

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** Does anybody have any grenades left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** I have one incendiary grenade.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:21]** Also, here's your supercharge.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** Works pretty well from my experience.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** If you can make the shot, you'll be good.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** What's up, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Here's our plan.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:39]** We're going to go ahead and we're going to pre-program the door to only open slightly.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** Just slightly enough for a grenade to go through the aperture.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** And then we'll close it again.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** The grenade will detonate.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:53]** And at that point, the next time we open the door, it's going to be supercharged time.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** And we're just going to take shots and light the thing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** Sounds good.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** I can supercharge that weapon, because that's a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** You can supercharge a grenade?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Well, I think it's a weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** No, not the grenade.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Supercharge the artillery laser.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I mean, if you can supercharge a grenade, that might be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** I don't know.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:15]** I mean, it says... I'd have to read Supercharged.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Yeah.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Just pull it up and see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** It says, like, target weapon.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Literally anything.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Damn.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Target one weapon.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** It's not specific.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:26]** I will say that I don't know that grenades are technically considered weapons.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** Like, according to the rulebook.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** I think they are, so I feel like you can.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** What would it do?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** It would probably just add maybe another D6?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** 4 D6, I think.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Yeah, 4 D6.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Additional damage.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** Because it's 2 D6, so it would add 4 D6?

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:47]** 4 D6 additional damage to the damage that's dealt by the weapon.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** That's intense.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** That's why it's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** I mean, it's under ranged weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:55]** Then I think you could supercharge the grenade.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** There's no reason to say you can't.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** All right, I'll bless this grenade.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** I'm not going to say no to cool stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Well, let's do it.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Holy hand grenade.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** I think that's a good idea, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** Yeah, and it's right on the weapons table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** We should make sure that pound is in there.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** I don't want to waste a supercharge.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** But yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:22]** All right, let's... I think that we should throw the grenade and supercharge my artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** I agree with... I agree with Rick19.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** I don't know if I do.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:33]** I was almost going to call Rick19 Chromehead again, or Chromedome again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:38]** The thing is, it's really hard to... What's the range of a grenade?

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:41]** How many squares are we attacking here?

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** 20 feet, right?


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** I mean, I like Nick's idea.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** So Nick's idea is that we crack open the door just enough to throw the grenade, and the room is only so big.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:53]** I'm pretty sure the detonation range of the incendiary grenade...

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Is bigger than that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** If that's the case, then we should supercharge the grenade because you might miss shooting.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** It's a 15 foot radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:04]** Radius.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Yeah.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** So 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]** And that room is 30 feet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** It would encompass a lot of the room.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** It's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Yeah.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** There we go.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Let's go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Let's do it.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:23]** Are we at all worried about the structural integrity of this vessel throwing grenades into small rooms?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** If you supercharge it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:32]** I am not concerned about the structural integrity of a building that's about to collapse on its own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** We'll have to shoot one way or the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** That's what I mean.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** I don't want to exacerbate it.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** We got to get out of this place.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** All right, well, we're all here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Faster the better.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Let's throw some grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:49]** I like how we're casually having this conversation as we're walking back towards the room.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** We're going to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Just jaunting along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:58]** For the listener, we're slowly moving our characters through the Roll20 all the way back through all the different rooms.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** We're just that good now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** I do...

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:09]** I do like the idea, though, that, like, I don't know, you guys have seen literally stuff that is the stuff of nightmares in here.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** And you've almost died.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:14]** And I think it makes sense that you've got to bring some levity to the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:17]** I mean, after all we've been through, we're like, oh, well.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Cheerfully walking along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Oh, well, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** It's fine.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:27]** You just kind of, as Nico approaches the door panel, he kind of mutters to himself again.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:29]** Nothing matters but the truth.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** So you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Nico's losing his mind.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** Don't forget that there are two doors.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:40]** There's one that there's like, right.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:43]** So there's there's a first door and then there's another door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Nico opens the first one.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** But as he says this, nothing matters but the truth.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** He says it kind of casually, kind of like it's a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:56]** As you open that first door, Rick's already got his rifle up.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]** Just in case that bounder made it through the second door already.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** And let me step back one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** Well, so you guys can see in there, right?

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Or no?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Is there a window on it?

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** No, but where the doors are, can you see past them?

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:13]** Because I don't have anything preventing you from seeing that on Rolls Royce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** No.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** Well, no, you have to take us to the other map.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** We can't see past that second set of doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** Yeah, but you can see past the first set, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:26]** The first set I can see one square, maybe two and a half, one and a half squares.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** We can see four squares.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** We can see the airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:33]** Okay, so put yourselves there how you're going to be when you open the door.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** Or are you going to open it?

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]** Because I think somebody's going to need to go in and open the door.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** I think somebody's going to need to go open it.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** Nico's going to do it.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:46]** He's going to be behind Nico because he's going to help him supercharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Are we talking to the first door or the second door?

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** Second door.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** Second door.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:52]** So we're already open the first door and there's nothing in there?

**[01:03:53 - 01:04:14]** there's nothing yeah okay john so then rick will be up front remember for this tour no one should be in that room if we're gonna go with this like grenade strategy because like we nobody should be in the next room right because we're gonna crack the door throw it in and close it yeah yeah okay all right so basically nico's gotta wire it up so it could be trigger fast

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:20]** Which I suggest you try whatever technique you're going to do on this door with the other door first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** So you know it'll work.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:30]** So Nico, Ryan's like, I learned this trick back in the old days when my dad was still around to teach me.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:41]** And what he's going to do on the door panel, and before he goes over there, he's going to say, Doctor, okay, things might get messy.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:45]** I think it would be wise if you stepped back and were on medical standby in case one of us goes down.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** You've got to have that emergency heel ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:52]** I don't have emergency heel, but sure.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:55]** Are we ready?

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** Wait, are we supercharging the grenade?

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:02]** Yeah, because once we open it, initiative might start, right?

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** So then I might not be able to do it in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:10]** So then Rick is going to have his artillery laser actually shifted over to his non-dominant hand.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:15]** He's going to be holding the grenade in one hand back towards here.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** Well, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Just got to make sure it's not empty, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Couldn't he?

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Say again?

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:24]** Couldn't you just hold an action and have it trigger the moment that door opens just a crack?

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** That would even supersede turn meter order, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:27]** Good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Yeah, I can hold my weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** Well, I'll throw it since I think I have better decks than anybody else.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:33]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** Um, so I'll throw it into the room.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:39]** And so that's what I'm saying is I'm holding it back so that here's can supercharge it.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** And so, yeah, I'll hold my action.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:46]** So as soon as the door opens, I'm going to chuck it through the door into the middle of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** So, okay.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** So, and then here's can do the same, right?

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:55]** He can be like, if it opens and we see that there's an alien, I can, he can then do the supercharge.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** He can then do what, sir?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:01]** He can then supercharge based on the condition that it opens and there's an alien.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:02]** There's a Grey Bounder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** So Niko's opening the door?

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:04]** Yep.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:04]** Sorry, right?

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:09]** And then as soon as it's opened a little bit, you're going to look here to see if there's an alien.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** And if there is, Rick's just going to throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** I think it's just throw the grenade without looking.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** That thing is, if it's in there, it's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** Yeah, it could be hidden.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** It will cover the entire area, probably, from what you remember.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:26]** It's a risk worth taking using that spell slot, so I'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:26]** Okay.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** So you're going to supercharge your grenade.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** I've never heard heroes cast a spell, so I can just imagine.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** This is a tense moment.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** This is a tense moment.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** This is your way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** All right.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:46]** So Nico is going to use this trick that he knows as part of his hacker specialization, though.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:54]** And he's going to create a computerized distraction in the door panel, so that way when it opens, it doesn't open all the way.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** Okay.

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:01]** So it only opens just a small amount, and then he'll quickly close it as soon as the grenade is back in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** So give me a computer's check for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** Because otherwise you're going to have a door open all the way.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:09]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:12]** 15 plus 11, 26.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:21]** You are 100% confident that when you press open on the door, you can control how much it will open.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Perfect.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:28]** So maybe you set it just for the gap, just large enough for Rick to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:32]** And as he does it, he immediately pulls up the screen to close right there.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** So his button is just over the close button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** So he's ready to just close it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:37]** Okay.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:41]** So Nico looks back one more time and says, are we ready?

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Here we go.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** He just nods intently.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** And Nico looks back at everybody else.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Rick nods.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** Rick nods.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:52]** Will is nodding.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:53]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** nods.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** This is your way out.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** No other doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:06]** Nico turns back to the computer, and he just kind of goes with a little bit of smug satisfaction, goes, and he hits the button to open the door.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** That's our thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:12]** You knew it was coming.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** You knew it was coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:22]** Okay, but before we start the next episode, somebody tell us whether or not we can supercharge a grenade, because we can always revert back before we do it.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:22]** Wait, no.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** I'm sorry, we won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** We already did this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** Hey, this is Kevin.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:36]** If you're listening to this podcast, you have probably played TTRPGs, right?

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:39]** So I want you to take a minute and think about your favorite character.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Are they religious?

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** Or are they spiritual?

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Or not at all?

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Like, in the real world, I'm agnostic.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** But that's a conversation for another time.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:54]** In the game, though, Rick has deep beliefs.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** We'll explore those later.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]** But I want you to take a minute to think about your character.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** What have they experienced?

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:04]** Because in the Starfinder universe, gods definitely exist.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]** Plural.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:06]** Gods.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]** Multiple.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** I mean, in fact, some of them even ride the bus to work.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:13]** But your character might not have ever seen that.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:16]** They might not have ever been exposed to anything magical or spiritual.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:19]** Paranormal.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:22]** So what do they believe in?

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** And why?

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** It's just something to think about.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** Anyways, thank you so much for listening.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** And we'll catch you next week on We'll Save.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:39]** Thank you.
