**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Last time on We'll Save... Our adventurers and dare I say lab rats did some further exploration of the Graze facility.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:13]** They discovered several items of interest.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:19]** The first set of items came in the form of some valuable currency and electronics.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:22]** The second item of interest was the room itself.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:32]** The room and brains were discovered to be a massive hard drive of information, no doubt harboring some of the most twisted secrets of the Grey.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:38]** The third and last item of interest was a door leading to an unexplored chamber.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:44]** Upon entering the room, they are confronted by a four-legged telepathic Grey.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:46]** How will the characters handle this situation?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:41]** All right, so I have a genuine question.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:48]** This thing happened to me today, and I thought this is exactly what I'm going to talk about on the podcast intro.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** Okay, all right.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** You're all ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Baited breath.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Yeah, we're waiting.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** I'm waiting.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Nope.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Nope.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** I just thought this is what I was going to do, but I'm not going to actually do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** Yeah, I thought it, and then I thought I'm not going to say anything.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** So I'm out.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:29]** we are currently like you know checking out some open houses like all right this is cool it's fun right so we walk in this one house there's like front yard it's like oh it's a cool front yard this guy comes up he's like so yeah this is how you know this is the front yard it's like a lot of people around but he's talking to us and then these people came in behind us and this this lady is just

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Are you Paris?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:36]** And just immediately, like, interrupts talking to us to go up to ask this guy if he's Paris.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** And I don't know what about it, but it turned on my petty mode.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:45]** And I was instantly annoyed at this lady for, like, interrupting us and doing that.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** But then I felt bad.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** I was like, I shouldn't be annoyed at this lady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** But she interrupted us.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** She interrupted you, like, mid-sentence?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Like, you were having a conversation with this person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Well, like, he was talking to us about the house.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** You know, he was like, oh, what?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Welcome to the house.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** Maybe you should walk around the side.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** There's a nice water feature.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** That kind of thing here.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** There was not a nice water feature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** What did you do to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** What did I do to her?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Broke her kneecaps.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** I threw a grenade.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:18]** What I actually did was she was at one point walking and I was like... You tripped her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Oh my god!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** And then I slammed her on the ground.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:42]** know i i just walked in front of her without like she was like walking some way and i just didn't like stop to be like excuse me because that's that's the extent of my southern hospitality that's like born in me to like that's how petty i can be so i want to ask you guys when your latest petty moment was what'd you do do you get petty


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:42 - 00:04:12]** oh yeah i'm guilty of doing it on the highways for sure like just driving driving back you know from seeing friends and family today uh i this was an emerge lane it's clearly a merge lane and like there's nowhere to go right like there's a lot of people trying to merge and it's clearly like zippering down and this big truck came like flying up on my left and just creeping and so i i just sped up and stayed right in my spot and merged in front of

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:42]** nice that's so satisfying i'm not gonna let you like that's because the pettiness is like trying to take over me as we're merging and i'm like i'm not gonna let you do that and i just think like my car still says california all over it so i'm like that's me flipping on my middle fingers that noise means i'm flipping my middle fingers up yeah um for all the audio only listeners which is everybody except us so that's fine i didn't actually set the guy off because that would have been super petty that that is the ultimate i have flipped people off while driving

**[00:04:42 - 00:05:02]** i've only done it a couple times but uh yeah every now and one time it almost resulted in an altercation oh i've been that's dangerous it's very dangerous yeah yeah it's better to wait because it just makes them more mad and it's true they can't they can't actually like retaliate because you waved at them like what are they yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** You just smile and wave at them.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** Honestly, that's probably the best reaction.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** It's also confusing.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** It's kind of the most G reaction.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** It is.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:15]** It's confusing and makes it look like... It feels like you're just like, ha, you're nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** It feels like a real-life trick attack.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** I'm guilty of those all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** Double tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Nick on the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:36]** Last time I was petty, I was on a cold call with an accountant who really gave me the rudest of the rude brush-offs.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** And I was very nice.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** I just said, I'm sorry for the interruption.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:45]** I wanted to see who handled office technology.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** You could humor that for like five seconds.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:52]** I know even if you're in the middle of doing something, you have time to be at least cordial to somebody.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:57]** Anyway, what happened as a result was he was more along the lines of,

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Is this a cold call?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** He's like, get the hell out of here.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** I don't want to see you.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Don't come back here.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** And it wasn't nice anyway.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** And I was like, I'm sorry.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** I'm just trying to do my job here.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Just trying to do this.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** And he's like, do you have a business card with your address on it?

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** If you don't have an address on it, you're not for real.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** And so, okay, let me go get my business card with my address on it.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** I left those in my car.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** I have my old ones here.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** So I go back and get my business cards and everything.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:35]** And I knock on the door, it's locked.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** And I just hear on the other side of the door, the guy goes...

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's him.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** Don't let him in.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** It's like, it's him.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** Don't let him in.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** And I just get on the other side.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** Such and such, don't be rude.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** She comes, opens the door.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** And I was just like, oh, hi, yes.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** I was in here about like five, 10 minutes ago.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** I had my business cards and everything.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** They didn't have the address on them though.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** And I went out to my car real quick just to go grab one for your husband here.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** And she's like, oh, how nice of you.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:13]** And then just as I was getting ready to go out the door, I'm like, thank you so much for your kindness, ma'am.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** I appreciate that.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** And your husband was a real treat to work with.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** I just watched her turn around and just look daggers at me.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** We'll talk about this later.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:27]** Amazing.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:34]** So yes, I took petty enjoyment, but I came back and told my boss that story and he's just like, yeah, don't cold call that place for a while.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** That was a pretty good kindness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** That was good.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Yeah.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Yeah.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** You did well for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:46]** Cause the alternative is asking if they drive like a gray Honda Accord and slashing their tires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** I'm sorry.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:56]** That's just, that's, there's a fine line between being Eddie and actually committing like acts of destruction towards somebody else's property.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Yeah, you don't slice tires.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** I don't know if I... I think I had... I told you guys this story before.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** No property damage.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** No property damage.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Let's hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Slash tires.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** Oh, wait, no, you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** No, no, no.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** In a past life, I had a terrible supervisor.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:25]** He made me really angry one time, so I knew what vehicle he drove, and so I went to his vehicle, and I took the cap off, the valve cap off, and you find a pebble, and you put the pebble in, and you put the cap on,

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:34]** And you tighten it down until you hear it hissing and then you back untighten it just enough to where the hissing stops because it's still flowing just very quietly.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:41]** That way they can get home and then their tire goes flat.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** That's like the safest penny ever.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** It's like the best part of the whole story.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Yeah.

**[00:08:46 - 00:09:01]** he blamed his roommate and his roommate he told his roommate he's like I know you flattened my entire ball blah and his roommate said his roommate's response is you can't prove nothing man somebody's done that to me laughing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** So I was never even like a suspect.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** It was great.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** Plus, it doesn't actually damage the tire.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** They can just go get it refilled.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** That's super true.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** It's just an inconvenience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:18]** If you have to drive it, though, to get out, then it could potentially damage the tire if it is fully deflated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:24]** That's why you just buy a pump that plugs into your... Yeah, if you drive your car on a flat tire, that is your choice.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Kevin's not legally responsible.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** Just because you made the tire flat, it's not your responsibility.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** They drove it flat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:47]** well speaking of flat tires oh i had to go on to mine oh please please all right so well actually this just happened the other day um but like i was at disneyland and then uh there was this giant ass meat the happiest place disneyland patitas oh this is

**[00:09:47 - 00:10:12]** a new level standing in lines yeah it's honestly not that petty like i think but like uh but um but it's recent so um yeah so there's just like a giant bee you know those bees that look like a fucking like i don't know how to explain it like it's like the size of like a bus but like an insect terms yeah and then they're huge and they're black and anyway so then like that was like attacking me and my girlfriend and then like um

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:17]** And then like we backed into this like couple and then and then they were like, excuse me.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** And then like the guy, the guy was like, and then like, I apologize.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I was like, I'm sorry.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** I'm sorry.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** And then like the guy was like, it's all right.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Just don't do it again.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:30]** You had to end it that way.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:40]** So then, like, I, like, I, like, went, like, I processed it and then I went, like, and then, like, started to, like, lightly mock him, like, audibly.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** And then, like, and then he's, like, and then he's, like, he's, like, what?

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** What are you trying?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** What did he say?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** He's, like, what do you want to, like?

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** you want to fucking roll?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Like, what are you trying to say or whatever?

**[00:10:52 - 00:11:01]** And I just like, I don't even know where this came from or I, it happens every now and again, but I just like took off my fucking sunglasses and then just like wibble, like swiveled around at him and then just like stare it into his soul.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:04]** And then he shut the fuck up, like right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** But like, well, Kelly, you're like, how tall are you?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Six foot six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** This guy was not tall at all too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:16]** So it was like, it was a hilarious thing to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** Just like the last episode, we were talking about how do you size people up?

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** No offense, but I would never try to fight Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** He didn't say he wanted to fight him, but the guy tried to.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** He had something to prove, I guess.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** He did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** If Andre the Giant was trying to build the Brute Squad, Kelly would be on it.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:39]** Not because he's a violent person, but just because he's just a massive guy and he can stare right through your soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** Hey, Kelly, you're so nice and even-keeled.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** Just think of you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:44 - 00:12:08]** just getting angry just staring somebody down and then like when it doesn't all bottle up it it's more like it's degrees of closeness or a factor but then also um yeah i mean i will get severely pissed off and i've been anyway that's all what's up what's up will no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** I was going to say, I just picture Kelly, you look at the guy and say, hold on, let me get that for you.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** And just brush his shoulder off and say, you had a chip on your shoulder.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** I cleared it off for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Classic.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:24]** Kelly, I could totally see that guy responding back to you.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** He's just kind of like, I'm going to go get security.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** I'm going to go get the Brute Squad.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** And you're going to be like, I'm on the Brute Squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:32]** I am part of security.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Nah, he just looked away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** And then that's when you reach over.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** You take his nose.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** Be like, fuck you, I got your nose.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** You just start talking like he's six years old.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:47]** You throw it on the ground and you stomp on it.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** Well, you know who got the party's nose last week?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** That creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Yeah, that thing messed us up.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:00]** I say we rest and then we go kill that thing because I think we can do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Yeah, and that's...

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Yeah, that's why I want to rest, guys.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** I need to recharge my damn spell slots.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** I need these spells.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** I feel like they contribute to the success of the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** I do want to say something that I thought about.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:23]** I feel like we had, as a group, a lot of retcon moments where I was like, I actually meant to do this in the last turn, so then can we go back and do that?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I feel like we did.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Yeah, I'm guilty of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** What, Gev?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** I'm guilty of it.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** There were a couple times that I tried to backtrack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Yeah, I mean, we're playing a game.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** It's fine.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** But if it's tough, we just got to keep it going because it's tough.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:40]** It's all the more reason to come down to trying to think smart and be cunning and play smart.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** And that also goes for me as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** I guess here are two questions.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** One, do we play too smart for our characters?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:53]** And two, rate of play, rate of play, rate of play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:13]** so yeah are we just too good you're just too good i i think it's just something to think about for all of us just we we just got to try and have you know you did this and they're gonna be tough times and we just got to commit to the decisions that we made yeah hand off the chess piece like you were saying last time right like that's that's fair


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:25]** Yeah, I just had a little bit of confusion of where the doors are controlled from, because you could lock the door from the panel, but you had to shut the doors manually from, or not manually, but you had to shut the door locally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:32]** Yeah, and we didn't explain that too, but I think by the time that we got there, the way it played out, I think, was fine.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** I don't feel like it was a big thing.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** It was just a thought.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Anyway.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** That's good.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** That's good, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:43]** I mean, if we're going to be committed to the rules as we are with Kevin's help, it's fair that you tell us.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** With the help of the firm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** I love the rules so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** We had some fan feedback.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:49]** Will, yeah?

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:53]** I got to retcon my stats.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** What's going on with your stats?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:02]** Yeah, so... Will got called out on Discord for being all messed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Hashtag join our Discord.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Well, I just suck at reading.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** And I envision the character differently, but it's fine.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:20]** So, the skill synergy doesn't apply because the scientific method is part of the custom micro lab, not part of my pious ability.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Okay.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:41]** which i thought was related to like racial trait i don't know that it would make any difference though it's whatever but uh so i don't get plus 15 to my uh life science okay oh dang that's a big change so what do you plus 13


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** Oh, that's a small change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Thank you.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Thank you for correcting us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** Yep.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Thank you, Jeff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Was that from Jeff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Yep.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** From Emergency Power Pod.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** Go check them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Friend of the pod.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Another Starfinder.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** They're a homebrew.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** They're a homebrew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Where rules don't matter.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Wow.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** I'm not sure they would follow the rules if he's calling us out.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Yeah.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** Homebrew is a whole different battle than Fallen Universe.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** But thank you, Jeff, for pointing that out to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Thanks, Jeff.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Much appreciated.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Much appreciated, friend.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Shout out.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Shout out.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Cheers.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Cheers.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Cheers, Jeff.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Cheers, Jeff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** To Jeff!

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** To Jeff!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** Think about how you guys are feeling right now.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:41]** Let's go back into that space where you just finished defeating the first ever...

**[00:16:41 - 00:17:02]** gray that you've seen alive let alone the fact that frankly you don't know if anybody else has ever like defeated a gray they are tall tales tales that you tell your kids when you want them to go to bed they're short tails they're only like three foot tall small tails mechanically yeah they're not duck tails they're not

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** So with that in mind, you're like, you know what?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:14]** Let's just go and see what that asshole, because he was an asshole.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** Let's see what that asshole didn't want us to see.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** So you go through the door.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** You're in this room, also demolished, totally unlike the room that you were in.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Demolished, cracks.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:32]** It seems like there's some sort of device that covers up the north wall, but the whole workstation into it, it's not connected to anything.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** The workstation is crumbled.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:46]** You see another small humanoid body, possibly another gray, but then out of it bounds this feral gray with these sharp teeth and this pure malevolence.

**[00:17:46 - 00:18:01]** enters your brain putting all this pressure on you rick steps in and this thing just takes a bite out of crime out of murder bot crime and rick is close to death and you guys are like nope

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Peace out.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Start coming back, figuring out how can we shut the door?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** How can we heal Rick?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** How can we injure this thing more?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** You finally get the door shut.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** It's clawing at the door.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** It's trying to get in.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:17]** You guys are able to back out to the second door, the full airlock door that you can lock.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** You shut.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** You wait.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** you hear the pounds as it's trying to get through the first door.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** And then Kelly, I think you tried to cast a spell.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** It didn't work.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** You couldn't quite picture the room, the ghost sound spell.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** You couldn't picture it, but fortunately we just ended.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** You don't hear any of that.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** So now you all, I'm going to bring you over to the map.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** You're standing in this room and,

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:47]** where brains were projecting information down, and you almost had a breast with death.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Rather, you had a breast with death.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** At least Rick did.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** So you guys were talking about rest before.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:58]** You were also talking about there are other rooms here that you haven't gone in.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** There are spaces that you haven't been into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** There's only two spaces, right?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:11]** The space we just went into, there's a pathway there, and then there's only one other door we haven't gone through yet, and that's to the north side of the main entryway that we came in, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** Yeah, you just don't know what's beyond that door.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Yeah.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** I guess status update is that Rick is still shaken.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Mechanically?

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** That's a good way to describe him emotionally.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** This is the first time he's actually dipped into his health points.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** It's the first time he's been damaged.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:38]** Every other attack, he is brushed it off with just, like we said, armor or just through fatigue.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** But this time, he actually received bodily harm.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** And that puts you in a different mindset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Makes sense, yeah.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:58]** Like, Hears has, in his time, participated in raiding ships, and so that's why he's more cautious and stuff.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** And so he sort of kind of expected something like that might happen, but...

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:20]** uh but yeah he does not like that he can't hear it actually i mean that could mean that it kind of de-aggroed and doesn't care about us anymore it could mean he might be further away maybe trying to find us so and he definitely wants to sleep so what are you guys saying what are you doing

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Honestly, Nico's going to take first watch.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** Uh, Nico's also kind of thinking right now, like, isn't this a lovely place?

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** And he's kind of, he's kind of filled with a little bit of bloodless too.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:39]** Like he wants to go back in and he wants to kill that thing.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** What does he say?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** The thing was all kinds of disgusting.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** And I guess these are the thoughts that are just kind of going through his mind.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:50]** He's not necessarily thinking about verbalizing it.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:55]** But more along the lines of he's just kind of... Is he pacing?

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** He's kind of leaning up against one of the walls.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:02]** The wall just to the right of the door.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Trying to listen to see if that thing's going to break through.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** But he's got his pistol ready.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** He's got his hand just above his holster, ready to draw and fire.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** And his hand close to his sword.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Because, I mean, he is quick fire.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:18]** Still going with that, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** I'm glad you're taking first watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** That's my boy.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Nico's taking first watch.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:31]** And he's just kind of listening for any signs that things get through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** He just falls asleep.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:37]** Are we going to rest up in here or should we find someplace more secure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** I don't think we should be moving around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** Have you locked this door?

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Somebody needs to do that.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** I do not feel safe with this door just being closed.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Here's locks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:51]** Nico will go to the terminal upon hearing that.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:57]** He's like, alright, Rick, I'll go make sure that no monsters are underneath your bed.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** I'll go lock the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** Take it easy on Rick.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** He's been through some shit.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** I'm thankful.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** I'm sympathetic, but also welcome to the big boys club.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** I've been down twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** I don't think you should consider that an accomplishment to be the first one down every bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:38]** go sleep the light's still on in the room go sleep so yeah he nico goes over to the wall uh goes over to the computer panel where the wall opens uh or where the doors open and he tries to jam the door like uh with uh electronically here's a little assist with that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** Which door?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:41]** The door... The door to that room.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:45]** This door locks, you know, because the gray locked it.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** You can lock it with the security card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** Oh, then, yeah.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** Nico will just do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** What about this door?

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** We should probably lock the other doors.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:57]** Should we check this place out again?

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** Uh, I don't think so.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:03]** Cause like we might just encounter another enemy at this point.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** I just don't want to repeat what happened without being prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:11]** So, um, this was a new area, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:16]** I feel like this is remember like, uh, yeah, that's, I hear what you're saying, but I step out into the hallway.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** John said this was the most stable room.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** That's all.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Go ahead.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Yeah.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** I'll just sleep in here.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:21]** Well, sorry.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Well, okay.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:37]** okay let's shut it out for the night then and i shut this door you shut that door okay yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:47]** I think mechanically, I'll say that right now, this might be one of the few times that you can get a full long rest.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:53]** And any long rest that you do after this will not be... They might be easy, they might not.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** Again, this is because you're in a place that's unstable, so you're not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** So we're all getting a full night's rest, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Yeah.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** I think this may be one of the few that you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** All right.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:09]** Full night's rest, gear recharge and everything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:36]** yeah spell slots back well gear recharge means you're like plugged into a power source right is there power i don't know that there's like a wall socket but are you trying to do that because i i i think if you wanted to do that you would have to like makeshift something night's rest okay whatever yeah i don't think you can recharge your batteries but you guys found some batteries on that were on the gray lots of stuff

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Yeah, you found lots of stuff.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Don't forget to check over that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Sorry, I'm trying to look up.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** There's a thing about sleeping in your suits, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Sorry.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** Say again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** Like sleeping in your armor versus not.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** There's also sleep deprivation.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:57]** It says a character who needs to sleep must get at least six hours of sleep every night.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** If she doesn't, she must attempt a fortitude save.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** But we're talking about getting eight hours, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yeah.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:11]** I think you guys, again, I think this is going to be probably the only time that you guys can get a full sleep.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:17]** You can do it again, but not to foreshadow anything, but you are in a place that's unstable.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Space.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Space.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** The final frontier.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** The final long rest.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:47]** i'm sorry we don't do hey hey no we no we love tng i think we talked about that we're a podcast that loves tng yeah i'm sorry i'm the next generation here you don't need to be exclusively one or the other man there's there's not a war despite the name of the one that you like there's not a war you klingons can be somewhere else we're not klingons get out of here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** So we are sleeping during a full night's rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** So it looks like you guys are spread out across the room.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:59]** It's really only here's a Nico who are here's and Rick who are next to each other.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** So are you guys just like going off into separate corners of the room to sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:17]** I think Rick would have gone – the pedestal thing that the alien was on, he probably would have sat against that to try to sleep, make himself comfortable on that with his gun next to him on one side and his axe next to him on the other.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Yeah.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Just in case something happens, he'd be able to wake up quickly.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:27]** I'm still going to look into whether or not sleeping in an armor does anything.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** Okay.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:34]** But Rick will not take his armor off just in case something does in case that thing breaks through or something else comes from another.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** What, what is everyone else doing?

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:46]** Is anybody saying anything or is anybody, is there anything particular that you're thinking as you are taking watch or drifting out to sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:53]** Nico's kind of thinking over in his head about the words that he heard in his head.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** X-D-O-Me.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** X-D-O-Me.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:05]** And he's kind of thinking about the very good sensations that he felt when he connected with those computers.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:11]** And that's kind of, it's almost becoming a very silent, guilty pleasure over there.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** It's kind of weird.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** It's very weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Do you share that or you just, I'm sorry, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** It's, this is all internal.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** This is all internal for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Give me a wisdom check, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** That's a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:29]** Can't quite place what, what that whole like word is.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:34]** So it sounds like you guys are, you come back in the room and it's tense.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** Nico is kind of giving shit to Rick for lack of a better term.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Not very sympathetic.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** And then you guys are quiet and you decide to rest and you sit down.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** You're exhausted.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:55]** You've been through a lot since the last time you rested.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** A lot more than one person maybe should.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** And each of you in turn.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** Who's taking first watch?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** What's the watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Nico's taking first watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Nico's first watch.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Who else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:19]** I'll take a watch, but I want to do something with my transmutation matrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Okay.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Let's see who's taking the third.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** You're taking the second watch, Dr. I'll take third.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yeah.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** Okay.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** So second, third is Rick.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** So fourth is.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** Yeah.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** So let's resolve what you want to do while you take the second watch there.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** You said that you want to do something with the living transportation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** Oh, okay.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:43]** It's, this is prompted by, by will not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:51]** And I also, I mean, I want to take 10 too, but, uh, well, but you'll get that as part of the long rest, right?

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Yeah.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** Okay.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Yeah.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** Like, like you'll get your stamina back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:59]** Hey, wait, before we go any further, because you talked about the transmutation thing.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** I was thinking about it.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** I'm the one that usually carries around heavy weapons.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:09]** So if I'm able to put two heavy weapons onto it, technically it only weighs as much as the one weapon that I'm using at the time, right?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** But it can change into both.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** So it might be a better idea for me to take over that thing.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Just saying, just the thought I'm throwing out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Okay.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Do you know how?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** Yeah, I'm fine with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** What were you thinking about doing with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:31]** No, I think if it helps alleviate your burden and makes you more deadly, then that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:35]** Oh yeah, everybody's trying, you know, let's make Rick more deadly.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Fan favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** It is your principal contribution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:45]** I assume you could use this more efficiently to kill.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Rules and murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** That's what I'm all about.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** Classic.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** That's going to be his autobiography.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Rules and murder.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** The Rick 19 story.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** Do you know how to wield it and change it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Since we're taking like an hour.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** I will say this.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** It can take the form of any basic or advanced melee weapon or a small arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Oh, it can't do heavy weapons.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Never mind.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** Just describe my whole conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** But an upgrade can do heavy weapons.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** I don't think an upgrade can do heavy weapons.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:24]** I think an upgrade can only upgrade the... Because this is a level five item, the Living Transmutation Matrix.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** you can only program in things that are two minus that level.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** So up to level three.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:37]** So if you're a level four, small arm or advanced or basic melee weapon, you would need to upgrade the living transportation matrix to put that in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Yeah.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** So you spend it.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Yeah.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** But it's UPBs you spend.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** So 4,000 UPBs gets you to level six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** Yeah, but I don't think you have any level 4 weapons that you're trying to put in.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Any level 4 small arms, right?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** Oh, it's only small arms.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Small arms or basic or advanced melee weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Yeah, I missed that part.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Sorry.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** It's cool.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:04]** But maybe you guys roleplay it as part of talking it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** I was thinking of an injection glove, but I don't have one, so I can't clone it.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Is that what we determined?

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** We can't download schematics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** You have to have the weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** This isn't 3D printing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** Yeah, you're basically copying the other weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** Okay.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** So we can't change it unless we have the weapons that you want to change.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Do you have a small arm?

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Anyone?

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** Say again?

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** I guess I could clear this up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** Hey, everybody, wake up!

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Does anybody have a weapon you want to use?

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** I'm sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** I'm tired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:42]** I'll just use my two small arms that I have.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Okay.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** So during your turn, you're putting in the two.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:50]** Yeah, I'm going to put in the tactical syringe spear.

**[00:31:51 - 00:32:00]** And I'm going to do the just the syringe, the regular syringe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:04]** Just be careful because it says it takes, you can have two weapons readied.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:12]** So you can have as many weapons loaded into this matrix as you want, but only two weapons are readily available.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** And it takes a full action to switch between those two weapons.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** So you'll have to use an entire turn to change from one weapon to the other.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:30]** But it takes 10 minutes to change one of your readied weapons into one of the other weapons that are, you know,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:35]** So once you upload them in, you don't need another hour to change the two-worded form.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** No, you just need ten minutes.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** You can take a short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** So I could upload all of mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** You could upload, yeah.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:45]** You can upload every weapon you have onto it one hour at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Yep.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Okay.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:50]** So I'm going to spend my eight-hour watch shift doing that sporadically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** It's not eight hours on watch.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Oh, your shift's only probably two hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** So you can probably do two weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** So, I mean, I can picture it.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:14]** And what I'm guessing is that you probably do something like you're programming it probably by like, I don't know if there's an interface, but I'm picturing you lay down the weapon that you have on there and then you lay down the living transmutation matrix on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** No, it's like silly putty.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** You just squish it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:23]** Yeah, like you push it on and then you watch it as it like spreads and grows and like you can see it moving.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Bless you.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** You guys heard that?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Bless you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Bless you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** Is anybody else doing anything else on their watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:40]** John, I'm trying to think about upgrading my two pistols.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** I mean, I have...

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:54]** Nico has a lot of skill in both computers and engineering, and he's wondering if he can take his two pistols and turn his azimuth laser pistol into like a level three azimuth or a corona pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** I don't know that you could do that since you don't have all the materials ready.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** That's my guess, but I'm going to look and see what upgrading weapons is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:09]** Could some of the materials I have that I've gathered around the ship count for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:17]** I don't think so because what you've gathered so far I don't think is necessarily like can fully account for everything that would be necessary to upgrade that.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:25]** You have found important components and you were also talking about upgrading your comm device which will be different than updating your weapon.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Could I do that now?

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** You don't have enough to upgrade your comm device.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** Okay.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:51]** keep in mind though when you're going through you're seeing a lot of as you did before you're seeing a lot of technology that's brand new you're like you are in a cutting edge place so you know definitely keep that in mind and with that in mind nico is going to try and see what he can scavenge in the room too thank you for reminding me sure yeah that's fine

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:56]** You don't really find too much in here because a lot is already integrated into the ceiling.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:04]** What I'll probably do is if you find anything else that fits with what you found, there's probably more raw material stuff that you can hear.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** Don't I have the jump jets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** I got the jump jets, right?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** I remember something like that.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** They're really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** Can I jump and try to slash open the ceiling with the jump jets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:24]** If you want to use the jump jets during your time, but I will probably say that you're going to wake some people up.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Oh.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** Which is fine if you want to do it later when you get done.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:31]** But it's probably not part of a rest.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** But you can try and take that down.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:36]** I can say that you could probably take 20 on trying to get stuff out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Okay.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** I'll do that another time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Okay.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** You'll come back.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** You'll come back to this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Kiers would be upset.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** But I like the idea.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I like what you're thinking.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:57]** So during Kiers' watch, I can't recall, because my poor note-taking on this, but I can't remember if the Electrovor sustained any damage.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:02]** But he wants to investigate if there's a way to heal it or...

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:28]** uh read read the description for the weapon again what's the the weapon itself called it doesn't really sit it's just it's an electric board no there was there was a term for it john do you remember yeah there's a oh it's it's in the notes hold on control f notes they make the world go around i mean okay it can siphon in battle to restore but that's resolve points but that's not hp


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** It's like a wondrous thing of power or something like that.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** Maybe this will impact what you guys are doing and thinking as you're on there.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** But you're trying to go through and think about the Electrovor, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** I'm trying to figure out... Figurine of wondrous power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Figurine of wondrous power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** How to heal it and stuff like that, yeah.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I want to keep him forever.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** He's cute.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:53]** Because I think if it dies, it just goes back to your... Yeah, it just goes back to your... And then what it just like... After like a day, it comes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Then 24 hours it should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Yeah.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** I love this thing so much.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I don't even have to take him to a Pokemon Center.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Oh, hey.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** Maybe he is quite happy.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** I'm just commenting.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** I'm very excited to hear that.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Continue, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** As each of you...

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** are drifting off to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Before we go any further, I found it.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** So the creature reverts back to the figurine if killed.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:31]** Although it can be healed in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all of its hit points 24 hours after the most recent activation.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** There you go.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Hasn't been 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:37]** Let's just collect all these kinds of creatures and just send them out to do our work for us.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** That'd be great.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** Yeah.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Okay, John.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** Love it.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** So, actually that's like the evolutionist playtest that there is.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:56]** As each of you are falling asleep, maybe some of you sleep dreamlessly.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** You just knock out.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Maybe you just feel like nothing.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:07]** You just fade into blackness and you wake back up when you're being shaken to either wake up or it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Don't shake him.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** No, not shake him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Don't shake me.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Don't shake me.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** But

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:27]** as you're sleeping, you begin to remember you're thinking back and it just comes to you almost unbidden flashes of memory to each of you.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:34]** Rick, you're on the roof under the legacy station sky.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** Here's you're in the docking bay with Rolu, Dr. Okay.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** You're standing in the misty landscape of the buck, right?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:58]** Niko, you're on the cool, high platform, wind rushing over, wiping away the tears as you're looking down onto Zenduko's face.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:11]** But each of you, as you're having this dream memory, one by one, something...

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:36]** doesn't feel right at first your mind maybe starts to recognize it but you're like so in the moment of just being there where you were it's like you recognize it but then you think you're wrong you kind of forget about it it's like that moment when you're like oh yeah i gotta do this thing i'll do it later your mind moves away from it

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:41]** But then you like snap in and all of you suddenly feel the difference.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:46]** That thought you had before that you thought was nothing is now something.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** You notice a change in your memory.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:55]** Nico, the wind is blowing from a different direction.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Dr.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:59]** O.K., you saw the name of those boxes.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** They said diorama.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** But now the words are in a different color.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:11]** Here's the... You remember just in the background of Rolu, there was all the Docking Bay moving around you.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** But now they're different numbers.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** 16 is now 19.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** 100 is now 50.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Rick, the skyline before you is just kind of different.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** You're like, I thought that's weird.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** I thought there was a building there, but then there's not.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:29]** All of this feels both very familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:38]** Maybe it has to do with the fact that you're in this space where there were living beings whose brain processors were used as that.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Maybe you're trying to think through it.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** Maybe it has to do with almost being brushed with death.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** Rick, maybe it's just the stress of everything, but you...

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** It doesn't feel quite right.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:59]** So as each of you wake up, that dream kind of fades into darkness and you all continue sleeping.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:03]** And then you go through what you said you're going to do on your watch.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** And then it's the end of the eight hours.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** And you guys are up.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** It's the end of the last watch.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:26]** Rick collects his weapons, and I'm assuming we all kind of gather together and talk about where we're moving next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** And that's kind of what Nika does.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** He's going to gather around the center console thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:42]** I personally think that we should go back and try to go through the door to the north as opposed to getting past that thing again.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** I know that we can take it at full strength, but I'm not sure it's worth the fight.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I think it's worth the fight.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Let's go kill that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** If it's even there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** We gotta preserve our energy.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** What's up?

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** If it's even there, you're right.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** You guys scared of this thing?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** We can take this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Okay, I changed my mind.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Let's go.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** But Nico leads the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** All right, let's do it.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** Grab your dueling sword, fly boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:21]** And Nico's going to take out his pistol, and he's going to take out his pistol and roll it in his hand at the same time, and he's going to unsheathe his dueling sword.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** So he's armed in both hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** Rick shakes his face, and he actually starts walking towards the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** He's going to be like, let's do this.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:32]** And Nico's going to walk toward the door with the thing in there.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** We all are crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Let's do it.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:41]** Rick, you're not going to see... I was kidding when I said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** I'm going to go search through the north door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Rick 19.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** He walks out the room.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:54]** Rick, before you go, if that thing can communicate telepathically, it can communicate telepathically with anybody else that's in this building.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** We don't know what it can do.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** We don't know what it can say.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:01]** The best way to keep someone silent is to keep them dead.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** He's a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** I tend to agree with Rick.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:13]** However, if you're going to spring a trap, there should be all four of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** We're not splitting the party, yeah?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** Let's not do that.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** You'd be so eager to watch that happen, wouldn't you?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** At least wait until he opens it.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** I'm telling Rick to wait until he opens it.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Just wait here.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Ask Hears to make his decision.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:42]** It doesn't matter what Rapid Fire, whatever his name is, decides to do.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** It's Quick Fire.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** You can't hear me.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** I'm in the hallway.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Get out of here.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** You should get your vocabulary checked.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Your volume levels are askew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** Now get your chromium butt back in here.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** You need to download your update.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** And Dr. OK should have a say in it as well, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** Yeah, well, I tend to...

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:15]** Nick, Nico, if you want to go on a wild goose chase hunting down every bit of vermin on this ship, or if you want answers, but I think we should go and look for answers.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** That's true.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I agree with the doctor.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:30]** If you would feel better keeping liabilities down to a minimum, I'm happy to back you up as you charge forward so brashly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:34]** Doctor, okay, that's a rational thought, and I counter with this rational thought.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:39]** Say that thing's able to scrape its way through the door, and we're off searching another room.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:47]** Do we really want a stealthy, telepathic demon monkey hunting us?

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:53]** without our knowledge from behind when we have the opportunity to deal with it face forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:56]** If it's not inside the room, what then?

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** You hunt after it?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:04]** You're going to follow it down to its little ambush?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but here's, did you see any other doors in there?

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** I thought it was a dead end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** There is.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** There was one door across the other side of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** There's one on the far end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:19]** Then why weren't we ambushed then in the middle of the night if we only secured one door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** That means that he might just stay in there, which I think is a point against your point.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:33]** I mean, if he stays in there, then why shouldn't we just go end him if he already tried to scrape his way out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:41]** Because we have to think about attrition and, you know, we got to preserve our spells, our everything.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** We have a lot to discover still.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** We're probably going to have to fight more things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Oh, I'm 100% agreed on that.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:49]** We're going to have to probably fight and kill a lot more in here.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** That being said, what do we think about the telepathic?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:56]** liability here that this thing could wake everybody else up.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Is that too dangerous for us to ignore?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** It's a total unknown.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** I don't know if he's going to do that or if he can.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** Do we want to find out?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Do we want to find out?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Nothing happened during the night.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** That's true.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Nothing happened during the night.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:18]** That's true, but we want to find out whether or not we have... It could be just an unfocused beast, but who can say?

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** Alien beings waiting for us?

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** I don't know if we want that fight.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** There could be ten in that room now.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** You want to open that door again?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** There could be ten of them in any room.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Yeah, they know the whole layout.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:35]** I'd just rather not roll the dice, in a manner of speaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:41]** Unfortunately, the game is against you as the entire game is predicated upon rolling dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:57]** As a manner of speaking, Nico is saying, as a manner of speaking, but I'd rather not gamble with our lives by that thing being able to telepathically set up an ambush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:00]** You want to confront what you think you know.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Doctor, okay, I am moving forward towards the north.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:10]** You are welcome to join me if you'd like, but I want to get off of this laboratory or whatever this complex is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** The Chamber of Death and Dismay.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** I'm sorry, Nico, but I agree with... Anybody got a door charge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:23]** Anybody got a door charge or anything that we can booby trap or rig so that if this door goes, this thing blows?

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** I could maybe engineer something.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Also, do we have a grenade?

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** We can engineer that real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** You can use my incendiary grenade if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** All right.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Toss it here, Chrome Boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** What kind of grenade are we giving away?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** Fair enough.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** Actually, wait.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** I don't think that's good.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** Dr. K, give me a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** You fought this thing.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** But not with a plus 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** Only the plus 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Still gets me 29, 16 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Beautiful.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:03]** I'm going to say that I'm just going to tell you what this creature is because you rolled really well on this.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:09]** And I'm going to give it to you because I think maybe throughout the night you just would have thought about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:15]** I could use my custom micro lab because I was within 60 feet of this creature.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Yes.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** I can automatically roll a perfect 20.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** perfect 20.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** So I can do it once per day though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** So I don't, but I rolled well enough.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** It's fine.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** You rolled really well.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** I think you would have known this.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** This thing's called a gray bounder.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Theorists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Yes.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Cause I know so much about that.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Cause I won't Google it.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Cause I'm not a bad player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** The best players just read the story beforehand.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** That's the only way that you know what's going on.

**[00:48:49 - 00:49:08]** Look, while the name you're like, maybe I've seen this before when I was just in the library and I went to the random, you know, like the like far fetched section with all the far fetched books about like, you know, conspiracy things and xenobiology.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** I might have seen this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** I must have seen this in a trade journal.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:22]** I must have read it in some journal somewhere, perhaps, about this gray physiology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Exactly.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** Like some journal that probably isn't well... It's not too peer-reviewed.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** It's not really respected.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Not really respected.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:35]** Maybe it's just coffee table literature that you and your colleagues laugh at.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** Yeah.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** But who's laughing now?

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Ha ha ha.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Ha ha.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:55]** You think that these things must be related to grays somehow, but you're not quite sure if they're different through augmentation, bioengineering.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Maybe some of them are different.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:07]** Maybe some of them were domesticated by grays, but they're like from the same... Perhaps they're from the same place because they have a lot of the same physiology.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** But you can think of them like...

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:30]** dogs beasts but they're like cunning they're malevolent they're fast they're agile they can carry out complex things think of like a sheep dog able to herd animals you know like that's pretty complex to think through and do they can be very smart

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:42]** primal focus in there maybe they're like cats or velociraptors and they can figure out at some point how to open open something can they open a locked door seems like it might be a stretch i don't know

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** But that's just you in what you've felt and seen so far.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** That's what you know about it.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Interesting.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** So let that inform what you guys are talking about.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Because I'm just picturing that you would have thought about it.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** Your brain naturally would have started to put things together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** This feral beast could be put down quite easily with your help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** I must have missed that part of the explanation.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Is that like a thing where they're not that strong?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** I didn't say that.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:15]** I just said that they're akin to very cunning animals.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:31]** The mentality that you felt in your brain was not like, I am this creature who... This person with this identity and personality trying to do... It felt very much like an animal, a creature responding to you being in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** A cunning one, but yeah.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** Right.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:37]** That sounds to me like he might not come after us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:45]** I know it's a gamble, but it seems like... Well, we know for a fact he won't open that door, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:47]** The only other thing is the other door.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** I don't know where that leads.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** So it could lead to somewhere else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Yes.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** Perhaps somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** Nico will respond back to the rest of the group.

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** All right, fine.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** We'll leave this behind.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:04]** But if this thing shows up later, I'm going to rub it in you guys' faces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Feel free.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** And that is a yes and.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** What do you want to do?

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** You're going to go north?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:20]** Rick nods as he hears that over the comms, and he starts walking forward with his gun up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Over.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** I'm going to rub it in y'all's faces.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:27]** I think you're right in front of the door, Dr. O.K.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:38]** So we walk back through that hallway and then into that big, long room where all the dead Krays were, and we step up to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:42]** Where the original computer console was as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Didn't we open this, though?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** The door to the north!

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** No, we didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** The door to the north!

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Hold the door!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Hold the door!

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Hold the door!

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Did no one get my demon monkey reference?

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** No.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** It was Game of Thrones as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** I thought it was Step Brothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** Conspicuously, there's an avocado-eating dog in the corner.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:13]** I've never seen a dog eat avocados before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:24]** yeah wait um real quick can here's like here's recalls like how these like grays died in here didn't they have something bored out of their heads or something like that like they all have


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:28]** Suicide Squad, they've got bombs in their necks that explode when they do wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** In their brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:37]** So when Rick knocked the other gray unconscious, its brain exploded because the bomb went off.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** It wasn't Rick that killed it.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Not because of the force of Rick's shot.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:48]** Or maybe the laser was at the right frequency that caused the bomb to explode or something.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** So it was a complete accident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:49 - 00:54:16]** yeah totally i mean i know you didn't intend to to kill it kevin i'm glad you also read the adventure like me so you knew what happened here's here's wants to know like if like that hole could be from the tail of that creature that we encountered sure do uh maybe men uh are you trained he told us there you told us they were about it was yeah did you oh i forgot them yeah it's okay yeah here's remembers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** Here's Peppa Trom remembers.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Here's remembers, boy.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Rick takes point.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** He's standing at the front of the store.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:30]** Rick's health is still not at full because you don't regain health when you rest.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** So I'm about half HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** You gain three hit points.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** You gain one hit point for every three levels.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:41]** Or if it's 24-hour bed rest, you get two hit points per character level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** Yeah, so I got back three hit points.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Trace commas.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** And your result points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Trace commas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:48 - 00:55:11]** i was at 11 out of 25 so i'm now or i was at 10 out of 25 i'm now at 13 out of 25 so yes my health is still about half every point makes a difference my stamina is full though so rick takes point he's got his artillery laser up and he's gonna push the button to open the door all right here we go you push the button breach


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:21]** It opens and you see a very similar situation as with the other hallway.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:29]** You see another hallway similarly running wide east to west.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** With the one door that you came in is in the middle of the southern wall.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** You see two evenly spaced doors along the northern wall.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:49]** But where the other room had a bunch of bright blue lines making these complex circuit-like patterns on the north wall, this one's red.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** So the southern corridor was blue.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** This one's red.

**[00:55:54 - 00:56:01]** You see these panels, tubes, these strangely shaped metal boxes, thick cables covering the wall that you're entering in on.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:10]** The difference, though, is that you do see off to your left, the ceiling, this dull gray stone, a lot of cracks.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:16]** And every time there's a vibration, which they've started to increase, dust comes down straight

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:29]** But to the left is an enormous chunk of rock that sits on the western end of the corridor beneath a gap of similar size.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:34]** It clearly fell down, semi-blocking the door that is in front of it.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:39]** You could still get in there, but you just got to squeeze in to get that door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:42]** Let me see what this rock is.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** Is this like, are we inside like a cavern?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** No, it's like the roof caved in.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:54]** The roof caved in, but this big chunk of stone fell down and there's a bunch of debris around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** Rick rolled a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** Is there like a cavity in the roof?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, there's a cavity in the roof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:03]** There's a big gap in the roof where it fell from.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** What's behind it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:06]** Rick, roll to 24 for perception.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:12]** Looking for tramps, any secret access points, anything weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Dr. K, you went in the room.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Nico, you went in the room.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Here's you went in the room.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:19]** Rick, did you go in the room or are you just standing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** I wasn't going to go in the room until I did my perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** But then everybody else went in before you.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** So did any traps trigger?

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** If no traps triggered, I'll follow them in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Here's the thing.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:38]** You do think, Rick, you were the only one so far who has rolled a perception check.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** Everyone else rolled a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** 13.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** Wait, no.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Hold on.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** I always think because I have no wisdom modifier, I don't have a modifier on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** You have no wisdom?

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Explains a lot.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** 20.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** I got 20.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Yeah, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Okay.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** 20 as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** 20 as well.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** 20 from here, 20 from Nico.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** 21.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** 21.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:09]** You do see that by each door...

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:13]** Whereas the other hallway had one hatch.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** Remember, it had that hatch that had supplies in it, like emergency supplies.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** There are now two.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:25]** One next to each door, one to the left and the right of each door on the inner side.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** And again...

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:35]** Without going in there, you're like, it probably has a lot of the same stuff that we had that was in the other one.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** And maybe you're about to go check it out.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Dr.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** O.K., you got a 21, you said?

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Yes.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** Yes.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** walks in, Hears walks in, Nico walks in, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** moves off to the right.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:52]** Nico and Hears start to move off towards the left, towards that rock.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** You're starting to look at some of the debris around it.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** Rick...

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:06]** You're still standing at the door, and as you are maybe thinking about walking in, you start to lean forward, and you do see something off behind the rock.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:15]** You see this... The best thing that you could call it is maybe like a liquid, and it starts to...

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:20]** It's like pooling around the rock.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** And you're like, why is this liquid pooling?

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** It seems to be dark, thick, aqueous.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:30]** It's covering the distance between the wall and the debris.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** And as you look, you see it.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** You're the only one who sees this.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:39]** You see it kind of like TNG with the thing that took out Tasha Yar's spoilers.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** It's like coming up.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:46]** You see this like shape start to come up out of the liquid.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:52]** And it's like spiky and amorphic shape that begins to move itself.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:58]** And it seems to go lash out at Nico.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** And you need to roll for initiative.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Oh, man.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** Yeah.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** As I bring up the dungeon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** John loves attacking me.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** I will be... I mean, you walked right into a room.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** You guys just walked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** Yeah, that wasn't smart on my part.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Yeah.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Dr. K, what'd you get?

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Nico, what'd you get?

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** 19.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Okay.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** Dr.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** O.K., what'd you get?

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** 17.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** 17 from Dr. O.K.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Here's what you get.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** Four.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Four.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Ooh!

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Rick, 19.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Nine.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Nine.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Oh, wow.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** All right.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** So, John, does this thing have a surprise round?

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** It does indeed.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Thank you.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** You took the words right out of my mouth.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:55]** It has a surprise round, and it looks like, let me show you.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** Boom.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** I'm going to make it super big.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** That's disgusting.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Super gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:12]** Spiky liquid avocado.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** It looks like a baby bird to me.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:15]** Oh, I see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:21]** That's like a dog eating a demonic avocado and becoming a

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:25]** dog-eating demon avocado-eater that becomes a demon.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:28]** Now that's an avocado-eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** You said it just like Kielhauser, Nick.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** You just kept going.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** It was good.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:33]** It was good.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:36]** It was an avocado that ate an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Dog-eating avocado.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** It's a dog eating avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** So this thing rises up.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:44]** It's going to move in initiative order.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** It did get a higher initiative than you, Rick.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:54]** So it is going to lash out at Nico rough times.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:59]** This is what it is going to do.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:04]** This spiky arm comes up.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** And you just hear this.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:19]** And that is maybe what starts to alert you, Nico, as you look and this like pseudopod like arm swings around to hit you.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:22]** How does a 12 do against your KAC?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** It is missing.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:40]** Okay, so as it swings around, it hits the rock, and some of the goo gets stuck on the rock, and you see it start to move and scramble around, and it totally misses you, but it is trying to attack you.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:44]** That is its turn on the surprise round.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Rick, what are you going to do?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Move action, surprise action?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Oh, standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** Sorry.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** I saw it, so I move on the surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Okay.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** Okay.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** I don't have a line of sight on it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** From where you are, I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:05]** So Rick in that case is going to... He's really irritated that you guys all just marched in there by yourselves.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** So he's going to be like... We roll!

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** I'm actually going to go fight the other one.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** So see you later.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** He walks away.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** No, I'm kidding.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** He sees this thing and he sees it kind of reach for him.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** And he's going to shout like...

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** Everyone, watch out.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:32]** And he kind of darts into the room, and he slams a shoulder into the wall, and then he's going to back up another five feet.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:38]** So he has a defensive stance position on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Okay.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:47]** This thing is probably, I got to say, honestly, like four feet tall.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** It is a medium creature.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** It's pretty big.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** It's not small.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** So it's taking up a lot of space.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** So you would have soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]** All right, we're moving into... Wait, sorry, I would have had soft cover from here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:02]** From where you are now, you will have soft cover because of Nico.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:06]** All right, it's the top of the first round.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:13]** Okay, does a withdraw provoke an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** You mean a guarded step?

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:18]** A guarded step gives you five feet without taking an attack of opportunity.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:25]** A full withdraw, I believe, you can also... But a full withdraw is nothing but movement, so you would lose your turn.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:29]** But a guarded step, you could step back and then take a standard action if you wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:43]** um no i'll do a full withdrawal lose my turn this turn but i'll use my jump jets and i'm just gonna fly over doctor okay is nico's gonna be like

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:46]** Oh, wow.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:50]** He'll fly over Dr. O.K.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:53]** because he can fly 10 feet high and 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]** The ceiling is like the ceiling of a normal room.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** It's a low ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Okay.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Yeah.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** So he's going to be flying head first over Dr. O.K.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:05]** And then he'll turn off those jump jets and do a forward roll and land on his feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:09]** I think there are going to be rolls attached with this, but that is super cool.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** I like it.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:11]** Quite cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Hold on.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** I'm looking up withdraw.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** So withdraw says withdrawing from melee combat is a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** I thought you had your dueling sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:22]** I do, but I don't want to go toe to toe to this thing with 18.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:27]** I don't want to go toe to toe melee with this thing with 18 stamina and seven health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** You have full.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** You have full stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** Yeah, but I don't want to go toe to toe with this thing with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:33]** All right.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** All right.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:39]** Let's see what those roles are, though, to do the jump jet flying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:44]** The jump jet doesn't require a role.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:46]** The acrobatics thing might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:51]** I think you might need to do that to get over Dr. OK in a small space.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Just an acrobatics check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** I am a short creature, though.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:03]** So a full withdraw is a full action, and it says that you can move up to double your speed.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:10]** One thing is it said that the square that you start in is not considered threatened.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:19]** And so if you're withdrawing, but if you are in a threatened square and you moved into another threatened square, then you do incur attack's opportunity on the next square if you try to leave it.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:22]** But the first square is not considered threatened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:22]** Okay.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:22]** All right.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]** So, yeah, I don't think you would incur an AOL.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:25]** You're withdrawing.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** You're fine.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:33]** What I think it would be would be an acrobatics check to do the forward roll over Dr. Okay.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Yeah.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:38]** And I feel like, to be fair, you've never used these before.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** I'm only five feet tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Mr. Bravado.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** Oh, let's go kill this other thing.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:46]** Just jumps back behind somebody else.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:49]** He jumped back behind Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:53]** I mean, the thing kind of got the jump on me.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** I don't want to go toe-to-toe with that.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** I don't have any heavy armor.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** I'm not designed to take damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** You got a dueling sword you like to swing about.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** But that's okay.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** It's okay.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]** And then I'll just wait for my turn.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** It's free action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** All right, I'll roll my acrobatics check here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:14]** Yeah, I think it's probably, you can't take 20.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** I think you're going to need to meet.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** That's at 21 for the acrobatics check.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:24]** Yeah, I was going to go with DC 17 because it's low ceiling and you've never used these before.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** So the DC 15 is already difficult.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** The plus two is for the low ceiling.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:35]** Sounds like you just were able to like, first time using them, just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:35 - 01:08:03]** fly back this loud jet sound as it launches out of your feet super cool image landing behind dr okay wow impressive impressive dr okay it's your turn what are you gonna do well i actually had my this handy vapor cavitation pistol okay i figured i'd try

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:23]** you're gonna do that i need you to that's a technological weapon right i think so because it has all this stuff in it one-handed small arms plasma doesn't say anything else i would say it's technological as you pull it out engineering check what's up an engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:31]** No, as you pull it out and you go to aim it at this thing, you feel this like pulling on the weapon.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** You feel like you're fighting against it.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** I need you to make a strength check.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** The weapon is preventing him from shooting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:44]** No, as he pulls it out, he like feels the weapon like being pulled towards the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:47]** This is the transmutation matrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** And he's like fighting against it.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Oh.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:53]** Give me a strength check after, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** Oh, fudge.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Fudge McGee.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** All right, I'm rolling.

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:56]** Fudge McGee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:59]** Is this some kind of magnetic ability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** Yeah, like, yeah.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:00]** 18.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** Magnetic goo.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** Looks like it.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** Because that's what it looks like.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]** Have you ever seen those, like, the Ferris liquids?

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:07]** Natty 18.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** When they have a magnet applied to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:09]** Natty what?

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** Natty 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** Natty 18, you're fine.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** You're able to, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:36]** keep a good grip on it and take a shot so what do you do uh well i was gonna aim it and then fire do a life science check beforehand do a lifetime check can i like learn more about this creature absolutely six on the dumb ferris ooze probably some other weird experiment that they came up with

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** 19.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** I'd say that's pretty good.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:44]** This is not super common, but not super rare.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:48]** Societies across the galaxy.

**[01:09:49 - 01:10:18]** created this substance by suspending coated nanometer sized particles of magnetite in viscous liquid and as like time went on and more experience more experiments were done on it it takes like a lifelike behavior and it almost acts erratically and it's kind of sentient and has this consciousness right and it's called a ferrofluid ooze

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:42]** and so called it you nailed it clearly something as it fell down some pipe something has started to pool this and this happens like you have heard about this happening when a magnetized material is in one place for a long time because of experiments of technology moving forward you know that it can come together and form a consciousness called a ferrofluid ooze

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:46]** You roll the 19, which I think will get you one thing about it.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:48]** What is it that you want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:54]** I mean... Or I can just roll a d4 and tell you something.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:58]** Oh, so there's four things that I can choose from and I have to choose...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:59 - 01:10:59]** No, not four.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:06]** I'm just saying that like I can like roll a dice and just see one at random if there's not something specific that you're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:15]** Is there like a immunity to a specific type of damage or energy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:20]** I'll say that you would know these two things as one.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** They're kind of one.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:28]** It's an ooze, so it has ooze immunities that normal Starfinder things with the ooze immunities would have.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:36]** So like critical hits, paralysis, poison, sleep stun, gaze abilities, flanking, they're unflankable, things like that.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:38]** You would know that.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:44]** However, this thing in particular, you would know that it has a resistance to electricity.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:46]** Resistance five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Because of what you know.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:52]** Well, this thing's resistant to fire, just... No.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:52]** Electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** No, five.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:54]** E-electricity.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** Five electricity.

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** Awesome.

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:02]** Well, I'm going to fire my plasma pistol then.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** Well, I'm going to destroy you.

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:07]** It is plasma, but it has energy effect too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:09]** E and F is what it says.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:10]** Vapor cavitation pistol?

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:13]** E and F. So electricity and fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** Yeah.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:14]** Okay.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** So would not all the damage go through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:20]** Yeah, I feel like it wouldn't all go through.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Okay.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:22]** Because of the electricity.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** You said it has a weakness?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:26]** It has a weakness to electricity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:28]** I didn't say... No, it has a resistance to electricity.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:28]** Resistance.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:30]** I didn't say anything about a weakness.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** That doesn't mean there's not one.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:31]** I'm just saying.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:33]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:36]** I just missed your... Well, I'm going to take... My brain is shortened.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:39]** I'm going to stay where I am, so I'm not going to use any move action.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:43]** I'm going to quick hand switch to my Costa Jet.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Okay.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** And...

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:50]** Hit him with a minor inhibitor.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:51]** Okay.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:53]** To do what?

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:58]** You'll take a minus one penalty to attack rolls for seven rounds.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:58]** Okay.

**[01:12:59 - 01:12:59]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** If this is successful.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** That is awesome.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:03]** Awesome.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** Not for me, but for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** What's your roll?

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:10]** 17 on the die.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:12]** That makes it a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:15]** It lands directly in the ooze.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:18]** Your shot 100% nails it.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** Five points of damage.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:25]** Five points of damage, and you set a minus two to attacks?

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:28]** Minus one penalty to attack rolls.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:30]** For seven rounds.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:33]** Will this thing be alive in seven rounds?

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** Unclear.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:38]** Not if you guys are going to keep rolling like you just did, Dr. Okay.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** Is that all you want to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** Yeah, because I switched weapons.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:48]** I can't move, so I don't think I have anything else to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** Okay.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:50]** Dr. Okay, what armor are you wearing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:55]** I'm wearing my basic Lushinta Tempweave.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** Basic Lushinta Tempweave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:57 - 01:14:00]** God, if our armor is made of metal, then it's going to pull on it too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:03]** Yeah, except here's what armor are you wearing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:08]** Kasatha microchord one is what I have.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:08]** Okay.

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:11]** I don't know if I have additional armor or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:12]** Not sure.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:16]** I don't know if I have other armor, but I do have that armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** I think this is something I picked up at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:19]** Yeah.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:19]** Yeah.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:22]** Yours is not like technological.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:24]** Yours is like protective fabric.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** So this is what I think would happen.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:29]** It's going to move.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** Is that door still open?

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:32]** The one we came through?

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:33]** Yes.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:33]** Yeah.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:34]** Yeah, it is.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:34]** Okay.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** It's going to run away from us.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:37]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** You see it.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:47]** You see parts of it start to like, as you hit it and it reacts, it like sends a ripple through the creature and you can see it like this.

**[01:14:47 - 01:15:08]** and like try and cover up the fact that you've now injected some serum into this Ferris fluid, the solution that it's comprised of, but it starts to like move towards you as if the shot and the fact that you shot it and the fact that you're like wearing something, it's like being pulled towards you.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:16]** So it moves up the side of the wall and starts to come over the wall and then come down and

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:40]** into the square right in front of you this does mean here's that you get an attack of opportunity because it is moving from one square that you threaten to another square that you threaten so only if he has a melee weapon only if you have a melee weapon do you have a melee weapon here's he does i do but a melee weapon in your hand yeah i think it has to be like ready to go no

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:42]** I have mine, don't I?

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:45]** But it doesn't incur... No, because it's entering your square.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:46]** Yeah, it's entering your square.

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:55]** And the big thing is that as it gets into your square, something about the way that it's being...

**[01:15:55 - 01:16:20]** being pulled it like immediately grabs onto the base of you and it is now attached to you this ferrous fluid is now attached to doctor okay so does this mean that oh oh fudge okay we'll see you next time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:25]** Hey everyone, it's Kelly.

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:28]** Wanted to give a shout out to the members of the Will Save Discord.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:33]** We've gotten to meet a lot of really cool people there who have given us a lot of laughs and useful feedback.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:37]** We've also gotten to learn more about a lot of you, which is awesome.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:44]** And we currently have a group of Dungeon Masters and Game Masters, as well as a group of listeners called the Rules Paralegals there.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:59]** We've been calling on the rules paralegals while recording and playing, and they've been assisting Kevin, our rules lawyer, and giving us really useful input on rules and best practices, which makes our playthrough so much easier because sometimes we're dumb and we don't know what we're talking about.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:01]** So special thanks to y'all for catching our mistakes.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:06]** If you're looking for a fun place to connect with like-minded listeners, come join us there.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:11]** You can find the Discord link by tapping on our tap link on our Twitter profile at Will Save Podcast.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** See you next time, everybody.
