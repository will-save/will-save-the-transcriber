**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:13]** Our group discovered that your results may vary while tangling with the hall monitor, and that you should always consult your doctor before becoming a lab experiment.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:25]** With the reluctant Rick ready to fight his way out of yet another cage, the lab rats realized that side effects may include cred-heavy pockets, tingling skin sensations, and

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:32]** and warping beyond the 50 extra-dimensional shades using some great experimental technology.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:42]** But in the end, it was the monitor who should have consulted a doctor before falling for the oldest trick in the sleight-of-hand book, and everything seemingly feels okay.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:48]** But have these test subjects concluded this clinical trial, or has this crazy case study just begun?

**[00:00:49 - 00:00:52]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** So let's jump right in.

**[00:01:47 - 00:02:06]** Last episode, you encountered a strange being known as the Monitor, with spinning golden rings and aklo symbols and gems, some sort of strange experimental asset in the Grey's technical arsenal.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:17]** It asked you, the test subjects, to take four experiments, a cred stick, the fusion fizz can, the toothpaste, and the sunglasses.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:23]** You were able to trick it into changing the order, into giving Dr. O.K.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** two experiments.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Rick19 said, no way.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Nope.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Jose.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** Then you find out that the projects here...

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:42]** These experiments were put on hold for something called the Chimera Project.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** That sounds familiar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I've never heard that name before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** It was the name of the ship that we were on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Oh, right.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** I forgot.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** How foolish of me.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I wonder if it's recorded anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Probably not.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Probably not.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Probably lost to time.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:16]** So then you leave, and in this strange room, you see that there are some lab doors that lead to another section of this hellish place.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** So you open the long hallway...

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:28]** and you see these flickering lights casting weird shadows across the 15-foot-high ceilings.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** You can see pipes running.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:42]** Before, all the ceilings and the spaces that you've been in have been lower paneled, and now you can see that in this long hallway, it turns both to the right near you and then further down the hallway.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:50]** I'm going to jump to roll 20 and bring you guys over into... Roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:51 - 00:04:13]** the map oh dang he showed so john always updates the front the the opening screen and it showed three green orbs which is what we saw down at the like end of the hallway exactly as you come in you feel this weird sensation over your bodies and as that happens there's this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** The sound, as you see.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Threen.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** Green.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Threen.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Threen.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Green.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Green.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** I'm really glad you said that because it saved time.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I didn't have to say three green.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I just said threen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** Why say more word when few words do trick?

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Why say more word?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Have you seen The Office, Kev?

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** No, but I've seen The Beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** I get it.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Okay.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Well, you've got to watch the show.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** I will.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** We'll make that a future Patreon goal or something.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Kev watches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Kev watches The Office.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Kev will watch.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Kev buys Peacock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:48 - 00:05:09]** that reference 14.99 a month amazing so i don't know where my music went but three green orbs me drag you guys over three green orbs start to flash and appear in front of you down the hall maybe 20 30 feet it's a long hallway maybe 60 feet

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** Nico and Dr. OK are hanging in the door, like right in front of the door.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Here's his right, still in the other room.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Chad.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** Is there an orb between us?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Well, you'll see.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** Rick, you're right up ahead.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** I think Chad opened the door.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Chad opened the door.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** But Rick started tracing it against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Yep.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:36]** Because there's a corridor maybe 40 feet ahead, and you're trying to get an eye on it, make sure nothing jumps.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** But as you all are transfixed,

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** on the flashes of light that are ahead of you down the hall.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I need everyone to give me a perception check.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** That's a good sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** What about Dr. O.K.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** would you get?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** failed, basically.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]** But it was... With your bonus?

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Yeah, with my bonuses.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** It's a 30.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** It's a... Let me check here.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** 16.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** That's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** What did you roll on the die?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Four.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** I rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** I got a plus 12 on perception.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** That's insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** Does Biohacker let you get all those extra bonuses?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:42]** i have skill synergy and i put it into perception like a boss because i couldn't put it in uh medicine apparently because it is also a uh i already have an insight bonus to medicine checks so i just switched it over well rick rick only has a plus six on perception so i rolled a 23 23 okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** What about here?

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** I have a poor plus perception, but it was 22 in total.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** That's still great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Because I just roll well.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Dang.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** This one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Hot dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:58]** So all of you noticed that one of the orbs only flashed briefly in front of you.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:10]** And you all see, here's especially because we're in front of you, but you see the light around your feet start to play and you realize there's an orb right in the middle of you.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** It's right next to Chad.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** It's right next to Chad.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** It's between Nico and Dr.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** O.K.,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** And here's a still just on the other side of the door.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** And Rick's in front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:29]** And Rick, you see the lights start to play because these hanging lights that are partially destroyed don't cast too much light.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** What is this orb situation?

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** You also notice that...

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:45]** Along the dancing green water light that you see, you see that Nico, Nico's hand is slowly reaching towards the orb.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:53]** And it's as you notice that, that his hand dicks into the orb.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** Nothing registers on his face.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** There's no pain.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** There's no feeling.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:02]** His hand is just inside the orb, curious for the truth.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:08]** And then in a flash, you hear this like... This noise.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:19]** And see what appears to be these heads that are shaped like triangles start to come out of the portals.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** And I'm sharing right now on Roll20 what they look like.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:29]** With this long extended neck, this head emerges from all three portals at once.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** And the head from the center portal...

**[00:08:32 - 00:09:02]** rushes through as if it had been charging and moving towards Nico and there's this massive pair of jaws that just extend down as this seven foot tall dinosaur comes through the portal biting onto Nico's head neck and shoulders picks him up slashes with one long claw and flings him backward into the wall careening and hitting the wall and

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:25]** with a sickening crack and thud and he slumps motionless on the ground blood gushing from gashes along his upper body and you realize that these are seven foot tall bipedal dinosaurs and that their bodies glow with a two-tone sheen of blue green and purple pink shifting with the movement of their dinosaur body

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:32]** Growing out of their heels and tails are these little mushrooms, and they quiver as if sensing new surroundings.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:39]** Weird flaps where their eyes should be open up, and you hear that noise again.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:47]** And the two that are down the hall, as you're looking at Nico laying on the floor, you hear...

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:55]** As the metal panels of the floor crush under their weight, they were also charging through the portals.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** They are charging at you.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** You need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** So Nico's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Is Nico okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Like his head is gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:12]** Part of his head and neck and shoulder are gone, and he has gashes along his chest, and he's laying motionless on the ground.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Can I do a medicine check?

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** Once you roll for initiative.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Nico.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Can you all see on Roll20 the creature?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Yeah.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Okay.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** It's kind of purplish-pinkish, and it's got, like, a triangle head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** I closed it, but it's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** And where's its mouth?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** And when it ducks down, it has, we'll say, written across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Oh, yeah, weird.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** It has, like, a glowing...

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** It has, like, a glowing belly and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:48]** Its mouth is where the neck seems to connect to the head, and the mouth, you can see, like, kind of goes down the neck, so it opens, like, pretty wide, like this long thing can come down.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Yeah, it's pretty intense.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** Let's do this one.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** I want to do this one.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** All right, Dr. K, what did you get on initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:08]** Um, I'm just flabbergasted, and I'm looking at Nico's dead body, and I'm so just distracted that I rolled a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** A three.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Wow.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** You rolled, like, your total's a three?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Total three.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** I rolled a two.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Oh, wow.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** All right.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** Yeah.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:22]** Yeah, and then you hear the, like, the metal denting in the hallway as these two other dinosaurs are coming down the hall.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** Rick, what'd you roll?

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** 16 on the dice.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Nice.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** I had 20 in here already for you.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** What about yours?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** 11.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** 11.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Wow.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** This music is still not giving me the energy that I want.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** This one does.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Let's start at the top.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** Does Chad count for flanking?

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Does Chad count for flanking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** No, probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:52]** I mean, Chad can't attack, but he could do some basic things.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Maybe, like, touch his face or something.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Distract him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** No, but he wouldn't count to give me a flanking bonus.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** I don't know.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** What do you think, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** That's street cheating.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** You never know.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** He's incorporeal, right?

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** He's, like, floating?

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Yeah.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Yeah, I don't think so.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:10]** Well, I mean, he's basically invisible, more or less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:15]** Oh, because if he's invisible, if he weren't invisible, I would say, you know what?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:20]** Maybe you would get that bonus because it's kind of like the fact that the creature could see that, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** I don't know.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** Yeah, if it's unseen servant.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Yeah, he's unseen.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** Yeah, I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** It's a cantrip or a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** I'd say a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** It lasts for a while, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** It does.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** It lasts for like an hour, I think.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** All right.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** One hour per level, as a matter of fact.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Good God.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** Because he could be around for hours at this point.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** For three hours.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** For three hours.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** And it's probably been since.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** One hour, maybe.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Yeah.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Really?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** An hour?

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Yeah.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:48]** Because you cast him back in the other room with the vending machine, right?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Exactly.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Right.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Invisible, mindless, shapeless force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Let's keep chat around.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** It's probably been only around for 30 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** Just a curious question.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** How do you get an unseen server?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** Did you do something to Chad to make him yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** Yeah, so... It's a long story.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** We'll get into it some other time.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Yeah, we go way back.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** It's a story I can't tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:14]** I was walking along the beach one day, and I just looked down at the tide, saw this silhouette, this beautiful surfer.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** With a machine gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Do you like to hit the waves?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Hey, bro!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:25]** Dude, you also own Surf Ninjas on DVD.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** Surf Ninjas.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Classic.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Classic.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** I've seen that movie in my childhood.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:37]** I had chicken pox, and I watched that movie, gosh, I don't know, probably 40 times.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** I loved that movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** I haven't seen it, but I really want to.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** I saw the three ninjas, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Oh, I was just going to ask.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** The Three Ninjas was like the three brothers who were like red and blue, right?

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** And Tum Tum.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** And Tum Tum.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** It was everything but the kitchen sink.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** It was like Home Alone plus Karate Kid.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Yeah, it was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Do you guys remember Beetleborgs?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Oh, it's a classic show.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** It's great.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** All right.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** So it is the top of round one.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:05]** I think you all knew what was coming, so there's no surprise round.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:18]** But this creature here on the right side of the hallway just comes down the hall, charges on Dr. Okay.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** God dang it.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** Going to make a full attack on Dr. Okay.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** That is two attacks at minus four damage.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:32]** All right, let's grab a roll 20 or a D20 and let's see what happens.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** I'm going to use the... Are these large creatures?

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** They are medium, but they're still seven feet tall.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** As a... Well, I guess I can't do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Okay.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Velociraptor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:52]** There's no like... Swift action maybe, but I guess I couldn't do a swift action before my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** I think it would need to be a reaction.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Yeah.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** Yeah, which allows you to act outside of your turn.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** All right.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Swift reaction.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** So first attack, it's going to come up and bite.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** That was not it.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** The sound in your head.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** That's a 28.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Oh, wait.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** 24 to hit.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Obviously.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** It hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** That is.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Please don't die.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:23]** eight points of piercing damage as this bite rips into your slug body.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:32]** And then it reaches up to swipe a claw at you, the same that it did with Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** They get two attacks each?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** If they charge.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** We're just going to get TPK'd right now.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:42]** That is 13 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** For new listeners, a TPK is a total party kill.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Total party kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Not today.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Not today, they said.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** You're a lot more confident than I am.

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:02]** Alright, that was its turn as it leers down the hallway towards you and Dr. K cracks a beer.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** It is now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** He gets hit real hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:09]** He's like, I need some strength for that one.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** That was nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** Real quick.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** What is your dexterity bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** My dex bonus is... I don't have a dex bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** What was your initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** It's just plus zero.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** It's 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Your dex is 11.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Oh, yeah, 11.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** It's 11 dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** And I also rolled an 11 for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** All right, Rick, it is your turn.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Okay, I thought you were skipping my turn.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** I was like, wait a minute.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** I'm just trying to sort something out.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** He's trying to sort out how he's going to try to off me or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** You guys have the same initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** I can't remember.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** So, Nico.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** Oh, first medicine check on Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:46 - 00:17:05]** i didn't roll very i got an eight plus that's my medicine five so 13 13 i mean you're able to tell that nico nico's chest doesn't seem to be moving nothing about nico seems to be full of life oh my god do you tell that to everyone

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** I think with a 13, you would also notice.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Maybe you can't see a bit because you're ahead.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** It seems like there's something wrong with the arm that was through the portal.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:17]** But you can't.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** It was only an arm?

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** He reached into it.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** He put his hand into the portal.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** But you can't see.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** But you're like, something about the way that he's laying.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:30]** It seems like there's something wrong with that right arm of his.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** But you're not sure what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Like the arm was cut off or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Yeah, like it just seems weird.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** Probably hears her, Dr. O'Kay, since they're right near Nico when they do a check or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** So Dr. Strange is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** Dr. O'Kay.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Marvel, call us if you need sound effects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** Yeah, over the comms, I'll be like, Niko's down.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Niko's down.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Niko's down.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Can I stand on a dead body without penalty?

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Yeah, you can occupy yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Okay, just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** I don't want to dig through the book right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** I'm not going to roll it as difficult terrain because I think it's fine.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** Well, I'm doing it for fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Well, I can also go to the other side.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** I was trying to get away from being in between.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:14]** So just for the listener, there's two of these things like in close quarters with all of us.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** And then there's one more at the end of the hallway opposite us.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:21]** So I'm trying to position myself in a way that I'm not going to get like pinned between two of them.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** So if I step over Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Like I am right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Yeah.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** No, I'm going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I'm going to go.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Hey, guys.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** What's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** They're not flanking you, though, by definition.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** So I'm trying to get that flanking bonus.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:42]** So I move two squares over kind of on the other side of the hallway, and I'm now flanking the one that just finished charging.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Nice.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:48]** In that process, I drop my rifle, and I pull out my axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:49]** Okay.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** Switching to the melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** All right.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Because I think there's a lot more damage.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** And so I'm going to roll for that.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** But flanking, I get plus two.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** So I click my flankings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** On Hero Lab?

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Yep.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Thank you, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Bam.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:15]** That is a natural two for nine points to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Nine points to hit.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** Unfortunately.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Doesn't it get a minus, though?

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** For what?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** The flanking gives you a plus two.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Oh, plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:29]** I clicked the flanking thing in Hero Lab, so it added for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** That will not be enough.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** I'm picturing as you dropped it, maybe you looked and you thought you...

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:53]** broke something and then you you went to swing you're just off balance because you you don't even touch the skin of the creature this weird like floral like has flowers and strange things growing out of it mushrooms out of its feet well that's my whole turn all right that's your whole turn yay we're fucked

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** All right, it is the dinosaur in between Nico and Dr.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** O.K.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** 's turn, the one that took out Nico.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:10]** And it runs... I'm actually going to give it... And because it was charging through the portal into such a small space, I'm actually going to make it...

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:19]** Do probably an athletics check to stop so it doesn't run into the wall because it grabbed Nico, picked him up, slashed, and then moved.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** So I'm going to see if it's going to take any damage from just charging ahead.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Athletics check.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:56]** has an acrobatics which is fine that is going to be a 21 so I think it is able to stop itself doesn't run into the wall and it turns and looks it looks around the listeners can't see me shaking my face at you and it turns and looks at here's how about the doors are closed I thought are they not are did we close the doors actually I don't know to be honest I don't think you did okay it's gonna take I thought they just closed automatically

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** I don't remember us saying that we closed the door.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Okay, I don't care.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** If we did, that's fine too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** You just said you were peeking through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** With your x-ray vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** Well, I have blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** You can sense the vibrations coming through, yeah.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I mean, this is no surprise.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** It steps up, comes up to bite you.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** I'm not standing right there, but you weren't using melee?

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Do you have a melee weapon out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** I have my tactical syringe spear out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** You get an attack for opportunity as it steps away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Of course I do.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** He sees that happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Do it.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Yeah, because it's charging.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:43]** The metal of the panel in front of you is like, with the weight of the creature, it like sinks lower.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Oh my god.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** And you can feel that vibration.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Yeah.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Yeah.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Does a 16 do it?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Against...

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** KAC.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Yes, it does.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Nice.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** As it swings, you hit at its tail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** Their EAC must be much higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:02]** Using your sweet... Is that a Kraken tray?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** No, it's a Norse Foundry tray.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** I've got my Kraken tray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** I was so excited to do an AOO.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** I didn't do any inhibitors or anything like that.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** So I'm just hitting them with a spear for nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Wow, that is great.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Nice.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** That's like a valid response.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** You don't have time to put everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** It's an AOO.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Wow, awesome.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Yeah, you cut into its tail.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:31]** It doesn't seem to notice that attack.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:36]** But its body, like, you know how cats sometimes, their tails just have a mind of their own?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Its tail moves in response to the fact that you hit it.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** But the creature continues its path towards here's.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:46]** And here's, the neck opens up.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** And it comes down to bite you.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:51]** Comes down to bite you, my sheer and friend.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:55]** That is going to be a 18.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** Against, yep, that hits.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Well, that's a regular KC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:28]** against regular casey yeah not your plus eight ten points of damage as it rips into one of your arms yeah intense intense definitely would be good to get the jump on the flank or the inhibitors something to knock these creatures down a step here's it's your turn a bite of you is in this creature's mouth yeah gullet here's just like it's just like holding on to his like care of his body like ah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:38]** And then he's trying to figure out, he's looking at it, squinting at it, being like, trying to figure out what it is life science-wise, biology-wise, to see if he can find a weakness.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Can he do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** You want to do a life science check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Yeah, it's a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** This is... Let's see.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Yeah, I think you are able to identify it.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** I will tell you what it is, and then I'll tell you about the weaknesses.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** It is called a dromaeosaurid.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** It's spelled strange.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:04]** D-R-O-M-A-E-O-S-A-U-R-I-D.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** It is a dinosaur, but they're freaking awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** But they're freaking awesome.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Well, dinosaurs are awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** This is a dromaeosaurid.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** They're kind of like raptors.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** They're pack hunters.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:22]** And they are able to attack a lot of creatures but also gang up.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:32]** You would know that it doesn't really have any... There are no significant weaknesses or resistances or anything to it.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** It's just a straight up...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:58]** batty with an addy that's about it okay you didn't roll high enough i think to get anything else or i could tell you like another feature that it has but for it's a pretty straight up gonna attack you yeah i got you okay well this isn't fun um so here's uh is wondering he might be able to like knock it back through the door is that a possibility


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Do you have a push of some sort?

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** I'm wondering if... You can do a combat maneuver, but you're probably not going to hit it.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** This is that plus eight thing that we're talking about.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** KAC plus eight.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** So you'd have to roll a KAC plus eight in order to move him back, unless you have a skill that pushes him back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Let's see.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** So I'm just going to use my attack.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** Let's say a missile might push him back.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** I'm just thinking that's possible.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Probably not.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Not technically.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:31]** You could do a guarded step back and then magic missile, but you'd only get two magic missiles.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** But you're going to take attack of opportunity if you do a spell within his reach.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** Though he's partially behind a wall, so he doesn't take an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** That's true because of cover.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** So you can do a spell right as you are.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** I'd say you have partial cover.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:47]** You could, yeah, with a KC plus eight, your options would be bull rushing to knock back.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** or you could reposition, but it would still be within your reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** So not to metagame or anything, but I would take a full action just to do the three.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Yeah, because he's just going to come at me again.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** I agree.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** We've got two other things to fight, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Just do what you're going to do, man.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** Stop talking about it and do it.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Look, okay.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Normally I just do things, but I got to think about this.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** This is hard.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** I'm not full of forever spells.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** All right.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Put this in the notes.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** Kelly spends 20 minutes discussing what he's going to do next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Very, very unfair.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** 20 minutes later.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** All right.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** So.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:25]** Here's going to fire a magic missile into the throat of this horrible thing.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Oh, man.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:29]** One will go into his little glowy belly for flavor, I guess.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Here's goes.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** Here's just throws him at him like in pain.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** He grunts out like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:36 - 00:27:06]** like that that is awesome and these orbs come out i almost want to think that the orbs because they're self-targeted go down its throat and you can see the light go down its long extended neck into its belly where it hits that's cool there'll be some indigestion for sure all right let me just do a quick thing i think that's uh one second is that quick damage that thing is going to be damaged damage what's your damage three three five five

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Three.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Three.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** So 11.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Dang.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** It is now pretty hurt as they explode.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:20]** And you can see the skin stretch to accommodate the explosion.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** But there are rips and veins that are starting to appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** They explode.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** The missiles explode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** The missiles explode.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Okay.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** No, no, no.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** The creature is definitely starting to be significantly hurt here.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** And you can see veins as blood starts to seep out through some of the skin.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:39]** And the fluorescence of the skin is, like, starting to fade.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** And the shimmer is moving away from the area as it's hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** I've taken 20 damage in total at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** It's taken 20 damage, which is, yeah, it's pretty good.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Pretty, pretty good.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** All right.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** You know what's going to happen.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:05]** The dromaeosaurid at the other end of the hall runs in to attack Rick.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:06]** Oh, no.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** It's going to make a full attack on you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** Is this a part of a charge or is this some special thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Roll a life science to find out.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** What?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** That's a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:25]** Technically, I'll just say that it has the same effect as the Greybounder.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** It's called Pounce.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** If it charges, it can make a full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** I just wanted to know, was it a rule that specifically applied?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:37]** Technically, it's a creature ability, and I gave it to you even though you didn't roll Life Science.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** I rolled Life Science.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** It's just very low.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** But you would know by now because I think you've seen it with the Greybounder.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** I don't even know if I have Life Science.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** You've seen it with the gray bounder.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** Because when you first walked in, it's the same thing that caused you to be like, oh, holy hell.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** I don't have that.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Okay.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Well, you just pick it up.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** I'll say that was your wisdom check.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Because I'm a soldier.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** Yes.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** I analyze tactics.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** You analyze tactics.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** I recognize the movement.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** This thing is using its boundaries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** All right.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:07]** I'm not going to tell you what it rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** This guy's using the bender technique.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** That's fine.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** I'm not going to tell you what it rolled to hit you, but it hit you.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** It did hit me?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Yeah, it did.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** You don't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** You want me to tell you?

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yeah, tell him.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** It probably rolls like 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** It rolled at 29.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** Oh, it was one off.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:32]** You didn't even need life seconds to know that.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:55]** just succeeded at a life size check without even trying i can flip john off in person yeah that's fine uh that's six points of damage from a bite and then it rips part of your mechanical servos probably out of your arm and then it's going to come up and slash you and that is okay i'm i'm very sorry you know what it doesn't hit you it doesn't hit you

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:09]** I rolled a number that I was pretty sure was a five, and then I went to grab it, my thumb hit it, and it rolled over, and I was like, I'm not going to... It actually rolled over to a 20, and you were like... No, it just rolled, and I was like, I'm pretty sure it was a five.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** It just rolled again.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Reroll it.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:16]** I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt there, but I'm going to roll a number that is not with yellow font.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** That's a 14 against KAC.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** 14 does not hit.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Hey.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Legitimate not hit.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Legitimate not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I feel so much better than taking that five.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Cheap roll.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Cheap shot.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** It might have been a five.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Might have been a five.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Might have been a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Well, I was going to say it didn't hit.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Could have been 29.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:37]** All right, so it comes up to slash you with one of those toe claws.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:41]** It has two toes on its foot, and it comes up to front kick you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Did you give it a flanking bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** Oh, it does have a flanking bonus, so it's 16.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Thank you, Cass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Does it, though?

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** I have a 16 KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** So it hits you.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Question, though.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** What's your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:53 - 00:31:06]** I don't want to... It is flanking, and we're flanking the other one, but my argument is the fact that we're flanking the other creature negates the other flank, but for the sake of the mechanic...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** I do see what you're saying.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** I think technically it's like each one is treated individually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:16]** Like, you know, like when you're flanking someone, you're both focused your attention on that person.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Yeah.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** That your object.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** Right.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:48]** pulled apart like they're they're they're um you're getting a bonus to your attack because they're like i'm not flanked yeah so for the listeners at home we're basically in a single file line of creature character creature character and then one offset to the other and then another creature diagonally and away


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** That is not flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** That's not flanking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** No, you have to be on the opposite side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** You have to be directly opposite to flank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** Opposite border or opposite corner.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** I mean, in this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** Sun Tzu, flanking is flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** Is that directly from the Book of Fire Rings?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** I'm pretty sure it's there.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Verbatim.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Just like that.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Flanking is flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Direct translation.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** It's weird.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** It's like an idiom, so it comes across.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Literally, it's different, but what it means is flanking is flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** All right.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** So, yeah.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Military history buffs out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** I think I got that wrong.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** The art of war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** That's not an art of war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Yeah, I also said the book Five Rings, which is Musashi.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** I don't know that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I know Carl von Clausewitz, though.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** You guys read that one?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** No.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Is it good?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Total War.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** It's good.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** It's like 50,000 pages of writings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** That's awesome.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** I like fiction.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** I'll stick to fiction.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Thanks.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** You do like fiction.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Kev, this is not fiction.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** It's nine points of damage from the slashing creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** It is fiction because it's a game.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** No, it's not.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** I'll take the damage.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** I'm also on the verge of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** This machete I have is real.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** I'm going to join Nico on the floor.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** Do we have a turn yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** It is your turn now.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** It is your turn now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:13]** I mean, just to let you guys know, I have 10 hit points left out of 25 and zero stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Like, I'm going to go down the next hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** Well, now that you've just... I'm just letting you guys know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** I'm just going to go lay next to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Are you letting us know in character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** Guys, I am not feeling well.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** I think I'm just going to lay down with Nico.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Just cuddle his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Take this!

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Don't close your eyes.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Stay awake.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Stay awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Focus.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Focus.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Can I toss?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:43]** Do I have to make a strength check or athletics check of some sort to toss Rick a med pack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Well, then it'd be an action on my turn to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** No.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Oh, yeah, that's true.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** It would be your turn to use it.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** I feel like you could give it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** Well, I could... Could I attack and move and then give him?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** But then... Your attack would be your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:31]** standard action well giving it to him would be what a swift action yeah i think using an item is a standard action yeah an item i think yeah i think it would be a swift action just to give it to him change grips if you moved and wanted to give him and apply it to him that would be your standard action but i think that's if i give it to him that's a swift i think swift action yeah pretty sure stab me with it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** Well, Swift is, okay, crawl.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** I don't have anything potent enough to help you, Rick, but maybe this med pack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** With the Bounder, we escaped.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** We were able to retreat.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** These guys were pinned and cornered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:49]** We're pinned and cornered and not in good shape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:54]** I'm going to attack the one between us that I have a flanking bonus against.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:01]** And I'm going to hit him with the pharmacological inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Nice.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Okay.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** And you're attacking the one that is between you and Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** So I should get a plus two, right, on my attack bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Because you're flanking.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Come on.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** This is important that you hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** I think you should take some medicine, creature.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** 17 on the die.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:27]** That is going to be a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** 22 to hit.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** That is a hit against KAC.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Well done.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** And which inhibitor are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** Pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** So you must roll a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** Fortitude save.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** All right.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** All right.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:51]** That is a natural 20.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:57]** You passed that, but you do have the encumbered condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Ooh, encumbered.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Okay, I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:03]** Let me do a little refresh on my encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Unless Kev knows off the top of his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** For encumbered?

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:13]** It does, I think, a maximum plus one to dex or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Yeah, I'll find it.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:20]** All right, so it is encumbered, and it takes damage.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, let me roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** How much damage?

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Six points.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:29]** Six points of damage against this.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** I mean, it was already kinetic.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** This injection should hurt a bit.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Sorry, creature.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** My bad.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:44]** Encumbered, all of your speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Oh, wow.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** That's great.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:52]** Your maximum dexterity bonus to your armor class is reduced to plus two, and you take a minus five penalty to strength and dex checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Oh, wow.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** That is actually great.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** So it's only plus two.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Wow.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** That's great, actually.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** That is helpful for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** What else are you going to do with your turn?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:08]** And then I'm going to say, like, I don't know Chad exists, right?

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** You know he exists.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Well, I mean, I don't know where he is, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** He's invisible.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:18]** So I would just walk through Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Yeah, you could do that.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Chad doesn't mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** I think so.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Hey, bro.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** He tickles you.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Oh, that feels weird.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** Hey, guys.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** And then I'm going to hand...

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Rick has a swift action.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Hey, I think you could use this, bud.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:41]** We don't want the same thing happening to you as, well, what happened to our friend here.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** And I'm just looking at Niko's lifeless body.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** 100%.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Like, here, take this.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Quickly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Because I can't lose any more people.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:57]** It's crazy that Rick is surrounded by two freaking raptors right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Yeah.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Yeah.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** It's a lot.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** It's a lot.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** And that's my turn, I think.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** And that's your turn.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** All right.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** So smart move attacking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Serum of healing.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** Mark one serum of healing.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Yep.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Yep.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** You get one DA to hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Once he takes it, right?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Yeah.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** He's going to take it.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** All right.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Okay.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Is that your turn?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** That is it.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** That's it.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** That's all I can do.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** What a good turn.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** What a good round.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** This is going to be... This could go any which way.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:30]** And you guys are down one player character.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:37]** Top of round two is the Dromiosaurid who is attacking.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:41]** Oh, I think, Dr. K, since you moved, it gets an attack of opportunity.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Did you do a guarded step?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** I mean, it was one step, so I could retcon and do a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** That's fine.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:54]** I mean, I did just attack it, so I feel like...

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** I would have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Yeah, it makes sense story-wise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:01]** And then take a quick short step.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** And then hand it to something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** Is handing something a swift action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** Rick, you don't look so hot, man.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** Because my thing now is on my turn, it takes a standard action to use an item.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** So I'm, again, pinned between these two things.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** I get to use a medkit instead of attacking either one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:43]** and then it's like oh you get plus four to your health and that's it there's my turn but it's helpful to d8 plus one right you don't have to use it yet also you have resolve points don't forget um fun fact though you're no longer flanking the one in the middle oh yeah all right it is the one in the middle's turn it's gonna turn and attack doctor okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Naturally.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** I expect that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Comes as a surprise.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Hey, no, seriously.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:52]** I was trying to just give you some medicine.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** I'm sorry that it hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:40:00]** You look really, really frustrated right now.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:04]** And I think you could use some... You could relax a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** It actually kind of pauses like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** I think you're right, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** It's just been a lot.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Does it have intelligence?

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Of a sort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** It just, like, looks up at the sky and thinks.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** It's giant.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** It has, like, little claws coming out of its face.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Giant faceless creature.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** Just sort of, like, pauses and looks upward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** What am I?

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** How do you know so much about me?

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** All right.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** It's going to bite you.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** It rolled an 18 in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Dinosaurs.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** I don't know.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** I got to burn a resolve point in a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** How much?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Seven.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Are you down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** I'm down a hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** You're down two hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** So you guys are saying burn a resolve point.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** You can't burn a resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** I can't do it right now.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** No, but you could.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Just to stay alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** But if all three of us are unconscious, then we're f***ing dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Yes.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I have 15 hit points now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Well, that was it.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** That was its attack.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** It's pretty simple creatures.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** It wants to attack you.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:11]** Except as it attacks the one that is... Where is it?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** The one that is right in front of here.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Just...

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:27]** And the green light comes back and the dromaeosaurid is pulled up into the light and it's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** You're just f***ing with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** What the heck?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** It is.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Rick, your turn.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Wise idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:40]** He is so beat up, but he's going to just take a guarded step back so he's no longer pinned between these things.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Okay.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Guarded step back.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Just kind of staggered.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** He's just going to lift his axe and swing as hard as he can.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** Oh, shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:49 - 00:42:06]** 15 on the dice with a plus it's only a plus 5 so 20 to hit 20 to hit against sorry I was looking at something else against the one that's at the top it's a hit but it's against the one at the top or the one in the middle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** The one in the middle is the one that's already hurt, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** Yeah, no, he'll go, because he'll try to protect Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** than just himself.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** So, yeah, the one near Dr.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:20]** O.K., he steps back and swings kind of to his right, hacking at this thing's giant head.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:31]** Swing in, and you hit, cutting into the fluorescent purple-blue of this triangle-shaped monster, who is also pensive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** Wait, guys, I didn't mean to... Oh, jeez.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Guys, I'm sorry.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** I didn't know.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** It's been really tough lately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Are you rolling a d12 for damage or not?

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Yeah.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** My axe is a d12 plus four.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** That's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Don't hold back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** That didn't count.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** I threw it and it bounced back at me.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** That was awesome.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** Five plus four is nine points of damage.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Nine points of damage to the one in the middle.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Good hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** And I pocket that medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:15]** I didn't get a chance to do a life science check because I feel like I had to do all my things.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** But I really want to do one before one disappears.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** If they are going to disappear because I hope they don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** It is.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Here's his turn.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Noted, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** I will remind you.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:29]** Here's brings out his little Pokeball.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** I'm sorry.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** It's actually a statue.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** And he kind of leans into the room.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** And he tells everyone, that one just disappeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:36 - 00:44:01]** just heads up and then he just like throws the electrical into the room and then it goes like and it comes out yeah and uh where are you throwing it at pokemon music and then he just like comes in next to uh yeah that's a good question actually i'd say uh to the upper left corner of rick so let me bring out a little thing here yeah there you go oh wait upper left corner yeah that's where he is okay

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:06]** And at the same time, Electrobor is going to, here's tells him, like.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** Just remember, one of his attacks is like an area attack.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** I know, I know.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I got that this time.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** I didn't forget that.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Yeah, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** And I'm on the verge of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Yeah.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** We killed both the dinosaurs.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Oh, but Rick's also dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** John was trying to avoid a TPK.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** And then you just assisted me.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** So here's tells Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Electrical discharge.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Jokes, jokes.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:36]** It's called, here's just kind of like, tries to like, taps on his head.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** He's trying to remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Ah, tail slap.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Use tail slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:44]** And he uses tail slap against the one that's to the right above Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** The right above Rick.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Okay.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** The unmolested one.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** The unmolested one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** That's his like, demon name.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** He's like, the unmolested, that particular dinosaur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Got it.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Got it.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Amazing.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** Wait, it was right... Look it up, man.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** You can use it in that term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Yeah, you can.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:09]** So this is... I'm not quite sure how this works.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:13]** It says it has a plus nine, so I think that's a plus nine to my roll for attack.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** I think John's still focused on where it landed, right?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Yeah.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Wait, wait.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** So you need to roll a throw first.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** An attack throw.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** An attack.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Yeah.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** You roll whatever your throw ability is.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:28]** Which I think throw ability is actually on the bottom of the, you scroll all the way down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Here's is always getting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Do you have those?

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Yeah.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** If you scroll down below like your weapons, there's an area that says attack bonuses.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** And one of them is thrown attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** Uh, right.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Yeah, I do have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Whatever your bonus is for that, you get that to your throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Okay.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** It's a 21, my throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Okay, so it probably lands exactly where you're trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** Yeah, yeah, because it's AC5 with grenades to hit the square that you want to be at, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** So I think it would probably do it.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** I feel like here's just practices all night in this downtime.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:02]** He's just, like, throwing that against a wall.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Yep, yep.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** Yeah.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:10]** I mean, you know how hockey players practice with racquetballs against walls and stuff?

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:15]** I did not know that, but I guess that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:34]** being awesome uh i was trying to find a freaking i i had an electric lizard thing but i i bought it there it is that's exactly what happened that is exactly what happened all right it is where it's right here right yeah there that's where it is or okay

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Does it have reach to hit that drumming sword?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Is it 10 foot reach?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:39]** Well, that's a good question.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** Why don't you just throw it right past Rick and then it's right next to it?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Yeah, we can do that.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** I didn't really think that would matter, but I guess it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** It just needs reach to attack, right?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** Or was it a ranged attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** No, I don't think it is.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** So we should probably go next to him.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** I just figured he would run.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** I just keep thinking of Pikachu probably.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** That's one.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** He would just run to it.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** Yeah, that's what he does with his tail slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Okay.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Tail slaps against the creature.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** How much damage are you doing?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** Or what is your attack, rather?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Wait, wait.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Oh.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Well, the damage will be 1d4 plus 3.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Well, what's the attack?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, we got to make sure that the attack actually works.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** So the attack is plus 9 to 20.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** So it's 18 damage.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Yeah, that's a hit against EAC.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** That's awesome.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** Yeah, it's pretty dope.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** This is what you need.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** This is a tough combat.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** This is what you need.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** We do.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** And I don't know if that other one's going to appear again all of a sudden.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Surprise.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** It's six damage.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Six damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Okay.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Did it disappear and reappear just to get flanking bonuses?

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Yes.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** It's smart.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** I can't fault them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** These were like the only dinosaurs that survived.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** They just evolved so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** They survived because they're smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** And now, now f***ed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** Because it takes time to ponder life's most important questions like Dr. O.K.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** has brought up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Flanking is flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Flanking is flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** And then it's like, Dr.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** O.K., you know, let's talk about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:09]** I have to ask John also, was that a critical hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Did you roll a natural 20?

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** If it wasn't a natural 20, then it was not a hit.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** But six points of damage from the Electrovor of electric damage, correct?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** That's what I would assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** I think it's just regular damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** It's a tail whip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Yeah, it's a tail slap.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** I really don't know.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** From an electric creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Does it say E?

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** That's fine.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** No, it doesn't.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** That's fine.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** It's all good.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:30]** It's all good.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** All right.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** So you throw it.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Energy comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** That's blunt force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Yeah.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** B. Yeah.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Bludgeoning.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** So that was your turn throwing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Or what else do you want to do on your turn?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** I can't do another attack.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:52]** So here's we'll again try to use life science to figure out some cool things about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** I'll just tell you right now, the only special thing it has is the pounce.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** The disappearing thing.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** No, the pounce.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** The disappearing thing is not related to the creature.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** That is something you can take away.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Or something, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** Something's happening.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** What is going on here?

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** We're probably like experiments in some kind of like... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:20]** We're probably experiments in some weird game where people put paintbrushes and toothbrushes on slugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Wait, where is this going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Is this a personal experience?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** Is this his experiment thing?

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Wait, what?

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** What?

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:30]** I don't know what's happening here.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** My charisma's just everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:40]** I bet, because, like, the whole, like, chimera project, and then, like, ending up as experiments, and the monitor was like, subject number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Yeah.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** You want to do anything else with the turn, Harris?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** I think that's all I can do.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** That's all that you can do.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** All right.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** This...

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Dromiosaurid at the top.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** It was just attacked by the Electrovor.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** It was also the one in between was attacked by Rick.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** So is that one.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** So I think it's going to attack the Electrovor.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** Makes the most sense.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** So it turns and attacks.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** You don't need to thank me.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I don't like it too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** I think that's what it actually is.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** That's what would happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** If Pikachu dies, he comes back the next day.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** If Rick dies, he doesn't.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Can't we just reassemble Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Does it 24?

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Can we reassemble Rick?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** No, we probably can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:29]** I need the bionic man or the million dollar man music for Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** We can rebuild him.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** That means we'll just have Rick be the vanguard for everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Does a 24 hit Pikachu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I mean, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:38]** Nine points of damage from a bite.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** You good, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** Yeah, we're good.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** He's alright.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** He still lives.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** It's that holiday good cheer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Holiday cheer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Holiday cheer.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** Nine points of damage to Peek-A-Vore.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** It is Dr. Feaster.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Poor Electroborn.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:01]** You were going to do a life stance check, but I think you now know what would be the result.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** It's fine.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Metagame.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Whatever.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** It's fine.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:17]** I'm weakened for a slug, which is not a place that I want to be.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** I'm going to hit Rick.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** I'm going to give you a boost.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** So you're going to get...

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** you get a plus one your armor class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:33]** Helpful.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:38]** And in that same... So I'm going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** Is that bold armor classes or just like KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Yeah, all AC.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:55]** So you... I mean, there's a freaking long paragraph, but you get a plus one enhancement bonus to AC with a basic booster, which is what I'm giving you.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:59]** And then I feel like I can do that and still attack, right?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** But not use a biohack or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** If you're giving him a booster...

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** But let's look, because you automatically hit when you're doing it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** Let me bring up character operations.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** I might have to do a full attack then and do minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** I think you would.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** Which you would automatically hit Rick, but you would get a minus four to attacking.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:23]** But in this situation, I definitely agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** I think that's the way to play it.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** I think it is.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:31]** So I'm going to roll to hit you, but then I should be able to use biohack against... Yeah.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** The creature, if I wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** I think you can use two because you're making two attacks.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Unless there's something that says you can only use one biohack per thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** No, there's nothing like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:43]** So I think you automatically hit Kev because you're attuned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** So you get a boost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Wait, are you attuned to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Yeah.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Okay.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** I feel like that happened a while back.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** I think it did.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** Yeah.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:53]** And if it didn't, it would have just through, you know...

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** We're in close proximity.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** Can I see a little piece of your hair follicles for a minute?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** My hair is constructed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:11]** As a slug, I'm very conscious of my skin and things that get stuck to it.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Anyhow, I'm going to roll.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** I get a minus four, I think.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Minus four for full attack, yep.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:19]** Ugh.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** I got a 13 on the die.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Nine.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Not going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Nine.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** That's a nine to hit me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** No, to hit the creature in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Yeah, that's not going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** But you did give me a plus.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** I have a plus one to both EAC and KAC.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Just super helpful.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Super good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:39]** So I'm just jumping between the two creatures then.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** The top round three.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** It is the one next to Dr. Okay.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** You didn't hit it.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Kev did hit it.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** I feel like I got to go with a roll of the dice to see who it attacks.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Because you did swing at it.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Kev did hit it, though.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** And then you moved.

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** It's fair.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** I think we'll just let it see how it works.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** I'm going to roll a d6.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Odd or even?

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Kev, you want to be odd or even?

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** I'll take odds.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Your odds.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** All right.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:14]** Going to roll the D6 from... What was the place that we got that plays the Munchkins?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** The Munchkins game?

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Oh, Steve Jackson's.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Steve Jackson.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Yeah.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** Got their cool rocket ship dice.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Is that numbered or is it just like rocket ships and something else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:23]** It's numbered.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Cool.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** But I rolled a one, Kev.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Your odds.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** Just roll low on your next roll.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:37]** This is the one that was hit with Dr. K's inhibitor, so it's encumbered.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Correct.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:45]** Kev, sometimes holiday miracles do happen.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** I rolled a two.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:47]** Nice.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:51]** That is a 13 against your KAC, which probably doesn't hit.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** A two gave you 13?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Jesus.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:56]** A Christmas miracle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** It doesn't hit, but, like, holy crap, man.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Oh, wow.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** That's why he was rolling 29 to hit.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Yeah, bro.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** What the F?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** Alright, that was its charm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** This is ridiculous.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Don't look at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Don't look at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:14]** I agree with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:19]** I don't mean to sound insensitive, but what kind of armor was Nico wearing?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** That's what he's saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** As he's not getting hit.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:28]** It probably hit you, but just didn't cut through the armor.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** It probably hit your leg and just missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** Is one of these creatures looking close to death, or are they... It's hard to tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:40]** Neither of them are looking close to death, but they are looking close to what we would call bloodied.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Well...

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** Sorry, let me explain this.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:49]** In 3.5 edition, bloodied is when a creature is less than half health.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Are we playing 3.5?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** We're not, but I like that term, and I'm bringing it in, and I'm saying you're close to half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:59]** So we're not even close to halfway over through this fight because only one of them is near bloodied.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** I'm just going to roll.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** I'm not even going to move.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:08]** I'm just going to swing, and I'm not going to swing twice because that drops my chance to hit really low.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** So I'm just going to swing.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Swing.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Which one?

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** The one at top or the one at the bottom?

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Doesn't matter.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** I probably missed.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** I got a six plus five is 11.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** The one near Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** I miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Yeah, that misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** That's my turn.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:22]** Game over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** All right.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** It's your turn.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** What are you doing?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** What can you do to help out this situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** He just closes the door.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** No, just kidding.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** He won't do that.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** Here's Tell's Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** He's like, remember, you got that glove.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** I don't know what he got planned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** There's that spell glove.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** If you need it.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Oh, yes.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Yeah, the Eldra Carnum.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** That has a, which one does it already have in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** Could you tell me some of the spells that are on it?

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** One thing you got, well, you got super charged.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** It's probably not going to help you.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** God, what else?

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** There's like an ice one.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, so.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Like a fire one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:07]** Right now, when you picked it up, it had a. It had a gem in it.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Yeah, it did.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:12]** When you picked it up, it had a magic missile gem wired into it.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** Oh, yeah, you should use that.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:17]** You also had caustic conversion, microbata, salt, overheat, and supercharge additionally.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Well, then.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** I know what I'm doing next time.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Thanks for the reminder, ears.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Here's wings.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** And then he cast magic missile for himself.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** He's like, you should try this.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Yeah.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** It's really fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Yeah.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Just kidding.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** No, no, no.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** It's good.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Cures can't catch a magic missile anymore.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:47]** So Cures is going to tell Electrobor to tail slap again at that same monster.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Okay.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** I love it.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** So such a thing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** Oh, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** So, yeah.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Use tail slap.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** Didn't work.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Okay.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Okay.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** I rolled a one, actually, to attack.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** You rolled a one to attack?

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** It's a critical fail.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** That's a critical fail.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** That's a critical fail for the Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** Well, we can do the card deck, or we can just say it fails.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** Or we can say it just high-fives the other creature on its tail.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** I think that makes a lot of sense.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:20]** It gives it, like, a ginger encouragement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** It makes a heart shake.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Yeah, there's, like, a little pulse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** I don't want to bump this dinosaur.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** No, this isn't good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** Just turned into an avatar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:37]** And so, like, the dinosaur's not, like, uncomfortable, but he's not comfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Oh, actually, that's good.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:44]** Can we, like, roll something to, like, make him feel really weird?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** He's like, um, please don't do that again, but...

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Thank you.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** This got weird.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** It got weird.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** And there's some interspecies love going on.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** And you know what?

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** This is a strange place.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** We are here for it.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** Thanks, Yul.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Thanks, Yul.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** Doesn't mean it.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:13]** What do you want to do on your turn if not encourage their budding relationship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** I mean...

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** No, I'm discouraging this.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** I don't want Electrobor to fall in love with the raptor.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Unless it debuffs the raptor.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** But I think on a critical fail that wouldn't happen, unfortunately.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** We can tame it.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Tame the raptor?

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** Every time we try to tame things, it really works out.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Highly discouraged.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** Actually, this would be even worse this time.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** But I don't know.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:41]** So basically, I think that was his main thing.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** So he can't really do anything.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** He's going to close the door, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** Wait, it's a standard action to tell the Electrobor what to do?

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Actually, maybe not.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:54]** Yeah, no, because the last time it was throwing it, but now it's just you take the Electrobor's turn at the same time as you take your turn.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** So you still have a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** All right, here's a little cast energy ray.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Wait, what?

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Energy ray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:00]** Energy ray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** It's a DC 15.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** There's no saving throw, so...

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:20]** oh that's for you then i think oh yeah right wait wait okay wait let's look up sorry i'm not on my i'm on top of my game today all right so i'm in energy ray dc 15 saving throw none spell resistance yes that kind of thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:43]** kelly you uh you have to make a ranged attack against the eac the creature and you choose what type of damage is okay it's going to be fire damage because fire damage okay so i don't know if that'll have any difference but i'm going to roll uh let's see a ranged attack so that's a 17 the one right right in front of you which one's the one that's almost dead

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:49]** The one that is lower in HP, I will just tell you, it is, yeah, the one that's right in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** Okay, let's do that.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** It's 17 to hit.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Okay.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** And it's a DC 15.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** So, yeah, that works out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Well, it's against the EAC to target.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** And one, the EAC was already reduced from Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Nice.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** And then on top of that, you hit.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** So, you hit it.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** So, it's a D3 of fire damage.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** So... Yeah, it's just a D3.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:05]** Yeah.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** But any damage is damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** So, roll a D3.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Just D6 and half it.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Okay.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:30]** or one two is one three four is two five six is three for all you listeners at home yeah there's no three set a day you can buy you can buy a d6 black market what'd you roll into it right that has a five on a d6 which would just be i bet you can make a d3 what's it there are d3 is it i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** All right, but let's get back to here's.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** Here's, you rolled a five, which is three points of damage.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** That's awesome.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** That's a huge Kickstarter.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Make a lot of money off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:37]** Three damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** Three fire damage to the one in the middle.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** Nice.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Simplify this for me.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Riddle me this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** In 3D space.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** There is a D3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Oh, there is.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** Yeah.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:51]** It's a weird, like, it's almost triangular shape, but the ends are, like, rounded off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** Oh, so it'll shit.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** It'll bobble.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:54]** Yeah.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** That's cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Is it cheating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** It's still a shape that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** It's still a shape.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** Have you seen those crystals, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:24]** which crystals like they're cylindrical crystals and they're faceted yep yeah yeah i think that's the way to do it that is the way to do it thanks all right it is the dromiosaurid at the top gonna attack the electrophore again because no one's attacked it but the

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** going to be six points of damage to the Electrovor.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:35]** I don't know how y'all are looking, but numbers are starting to stack up here, I feel like.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Still alright for a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** Still okay.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** I'm not feeling so hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** A couple more of these things disappear for us.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** These green orbs to relieve us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:55]** I'm going to attack this one in front of me because it took a swing at me a minute ago.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:59]** That's a 15 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:04]** A 15 to hit the one in front of you, which already had its AC lowered.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** That's a hit against Casey, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Nicely done.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:24]** Yeah, so I'm going to hinder his defenses further with my final basic inhibitor.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Oh, dang.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:29]** And take a minus two penalty to your AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** Minus two penalty to AC.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:31]** Yes.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Dang.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** Sorry, what did you roll to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** That was a 15 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Yeah, we talked about that.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** Damage.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** Minus two again.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** All right.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** It's starting to get low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** Get low, get low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Okay.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Eight points.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:48]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Yeah.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** Nine points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Dang.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:54]** Not.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** Plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** 26 plus five, and I rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Dang.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** It is bloodied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** That's awesome.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Super bloodied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:02]** But it's only half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** No.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** Well, yeah.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** It's bloodied, which means it's past half.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** So, wow.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** That was awesome.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:15]** I'm trying to find the exact verbiage, but to use a serum is a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:18]** I think...

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]** It's either that or it's a move action.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** Because move action is manipulate item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** Well, if it's a move action, I can do it.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** I found... I think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** I think it's on moveaction.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:33]** Serums take a full action to give to a helpless or unconscious person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Yeah, you're not doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** Because I'm not quite helpless.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** Close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Yeah.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:43]** Well, I was trying to... Also, I think we should go a little past the hour here.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** What?

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** What?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** You want to?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Bring it.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:50]** Because we've been looking at some rules, you know?

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:51]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** Let's see what can happen in this combat.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:55]** Okay, so Dr.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** O.K., you went.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Was that your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Yeah, that's my turn.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** I don't... Do I need to move?

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:09]** Like, I feel like I'm in a good position between everyone sort of not being flanked anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** It is a little bit of a... Just a...

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** It's just nobody's flanking anybody anymore.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:15]** Yeah, no one's flanking anybody.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:19]** It's just a straight like no one's moving because it's a tight corridor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:27]** Our column is shifted where the Electrobor is above Rick, then Rick, then myself.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:30]** Nico's dead body is behind us.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Here's in the other room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:37]** We don't know for sure, but like Chad could turn on us and then it would be flanking you with the other dinosaur thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]** Me and Chad are pretty cool, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** They share burritos once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Hey, bro.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** It's the top of round four.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** I know you're around.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:50]** I'm sorry that you're not in the action.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** You guys notice.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** Also, I wish you were in the action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** I wish, though.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** Regrettably, he can't.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:02]** He can do something.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** Top around four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:14]** The dromaeosaur that is in front of the electrophore, you see the same green light appear.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:20]** And that dinosaur is sucked into the green light.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:26]** And in its place comes the one that disappeared before.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:31]** But recall, the one that disappeared before had taken more damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:39]** I can't tell if this is like plot armor or if this is like a part of the actual combat and you're just with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:46]** It is replaced by the one that disappeared before with less HP.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Stay tuned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Wait till the end of the book.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** You will find out very soon.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** So you remember that fight with those dinosaur things?

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** Very soon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:01]** Dr. K, you hit the one.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:02]** Yeah.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** I just caught John.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** Sorry.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** I'll be honest.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** I don't know what is going on.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:09]** We'll discuss later.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** Okay.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** I don't know what I agreed to.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** You'll find out very soon.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** Yeah.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** I don't know what I... I'm just talking.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** It's fine.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:16]** There's no plot armor BS.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:20]** It goes to attack Dr. K. Ridiculous.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** No.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:21]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** Dr. K, this is the worst news I'm going to tell you.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** I got a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** I think I'm done, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** If you get more than 15 points of damage, he's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** He's down?

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** It's 2d6.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** And let's just confirm.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** You roll twice.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:38]** You add the whole modifier both times.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** Or is it once?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** I'm really scared right now.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** I'm concerned.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:51]** I might have to create my second character way sooner than I had hoped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** You have resolve points, yes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:55]** Okay.

**[01:07:55 - 01:08:02]** You roll twice your damage each time with all your usual bonuses and including any additional damage from your special abilities.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** That sounds to me like he adds the bonus twice.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** And then add the roll together, so you do the bonus twice.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:06]** Yeah.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** And your bonus is a plus eight?

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** No, it's plus five.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** D6 plus 5.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:15]** So it's already a plus 10, so if you roll a 2 or 3 or more, he's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** You're down.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:16]** I'm down.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** Dead.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:22]** No, let's not... You could do extreme, though.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:22]** No.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:29]** It would have to be that the damage below 0 is more than your HP, which is not possible at this point.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** Well, what's your max HP?

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:32]** 20.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** 20.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** so I'm already going to do 10 that will, and you're at 15.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:40]** So that would, so I would need to get five and then another 20, which is not possible to do six.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** So it's not massive damage rules.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:48]** Uh, well, not fine, but I was not prepared to die this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** Should I roll it here in front of the table?

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Let's do it.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** John's John's rolling out, out in the open.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:58]** My fate, uh, for the listener, he, he stepped away from the mic.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:02]** He is rolling, uh, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:06]** I'm not going to use the heavier gem die because it doesn't roll as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:08]** Well, you can break this TV.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:08]** It's fine.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:10]** It's already been broken.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:10]** Rest in peace.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** May it rest in peace.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:16]** A crit six and a four.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** Oh, my God.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** It's 20 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:22]** Dr. K is down.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** I'm down.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]** You multiplied it or you roll it twice?

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** I thought it said roll twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** It says roll twice.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:29]** I didn't multiply.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** I rolled two D6s.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:30]** Oh, okay.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** So it was one D6 plus five.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Another D6 plus five.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:34]** Okay.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** Not times.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** Well, I meant... Yeah.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:43]** Dr. Okay joins Nico on the ground.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:45]** Not sure if he's down or not.

**[01:09:45 - 01:10:06]** damn i mean i don't i don't i gotta start reading what i need to do well yeah you yeah we're talking about resolve point territory here dr okay you also had the the elder carnum i did so if somebody i'm just gonna say somebody might want to try and grab that elder carnum because it's a free you can take full action with the magic missiles pick it up use it it's a lot of damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]** Because I'm standing in melee.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:14]** If I pick up a weapon and then use a spell, I'm going to get attacked by both of them and then die.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** Because I only have 10 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** This is crazy.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** This is bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** All right.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:21]** Well, this is not good.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** You do have, you can take, you have RP.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:28]** You have resource points, right?

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** Resolve points.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:29]** Resolve.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:29]** Sorry.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:31]** Now my brain's like all fried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:35]** I quit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:38]** What do you want to do?

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:38]** No.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:38]** Don't you do that.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** Too soon.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** God dang it.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** Rick is going to swing at the one that's bloodied.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:45]** Okay.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:46]** Okay.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:47]** Okay.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:48 - 01:11:10]** nine plus five fourteen to hit yeah that hits the one yeah that that definitely hits oh i hope it's dead i rolled an 11 on the dice damn and i get a plus i believe four to the attack uh plus 15 points of damage i'm double checking plus four so 15 points of damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** So close to death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:12]** Are you kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:16]** It's so close to death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** And it's still alive.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** Meanwhile, there's 15 points to either of us and we're completely dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:22]** And then it gets sucked away and the other one comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** Hey, I'm better health than that one was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:28]** Plus, I've been meditating on my life and so now, like, all of a sudden...

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** I don't know.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:35]** The one that is near the Electrovor is going to attack the Electrovor again.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:36]** Okay.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:39]** This may be something that's helping you.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** Good call on using the Electrovor and trying to distract it.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** That is a good call.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** Thank you.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:47]** Let's hope Electrovor sticks in for another round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** Electrovor only has like two points of health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** He doesn't have much left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:53]** I rolled another two, so that's 13 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** Does that hit?

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Hold on, let me check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]** I rolled a two, and so that's a 28.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** That does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:01]** That does not hit the Electrovor.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:03]** That does not hit the Electrovor.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:06]** Electrovor staying in for one more round at least.

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:08]** Electrovor, you use Harden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:13]** I got too excited about that.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** All right.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]** Somebody out there was like, yeah, well,

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** One more round.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** Hell yeah, Electivore.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** All right, Electivore.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** What are you doing?

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** This is crazy combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** It is.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** It's insane.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:24]** But.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** But.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:26]** Here's has his good old friend, Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:32]** And here says to Chad, Chad, get that glove off of Rick and bring it to me.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:33]** Oh.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:33]** Right now.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Right now.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Not Rick.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:35]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Whatever.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** Sorry.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:38]** Not Rick.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:39]** I'm not dead yet.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** For now.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:41]** All right.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** So Chad does this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** Yeah.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:45]** I think Chad can pick up items.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** He can.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]** Move.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** He's unseen.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** I don't think there's going to be an AOO against it.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** I don't think.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** Is Chad, like, floating?

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:57]** Chad doesn't have any, like, doesn't leave any vibrations or whatever.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:57]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:00]** Chad's just an ethereal thing at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Yeah, it floats away.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:05]** You see the glove just kind of float through the air.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:08]** I can't think of any rules or reason why it wouldn't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Chad, make sure you get the gems, too.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** The gems, they're all there.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:13]** That's a free action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:15]** Can it get all the gems?

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** Well, I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:39]** hold on one second so uh let's not go through it i'm pretty sure it can i'm not gonna say it won't so they were in a pouch yeah yeah yeah to the glove around my wrist yes it was just hanging on like like like a charm you know it's fine i forgot the question oh what does it take to tell it's nothing because like it just takes time to cast him so it's just like a regular thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:41]** Chad's like, bro, I can't get the clip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:47]** He's laying on the clip.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** Chad's got it.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** All right.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** Good.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:50]** Thanks, man.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:50]** Sorry you're down.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** He brings it to me.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:55]** Through the doors.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:58]** Throws a burrito on your body.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** These make me feel all better, yeah.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:03]** All right.

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:03]** He takes the glove.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:04]** Yep.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:06]** Oh, come on, Kevin.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** Sorry, rulesman, man.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:11]** It takes a move action to command.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** Where does it say that?

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** In the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:14]** All right.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** Hold on.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:22]** The spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command, a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** Well, I didn't move, so that's fine.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:26]** Sorry, I'm getting angry at Kevin.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:27]** That's not good.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:29]** I'm just saying I really want this glove.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** So thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** But you have it now.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:35]** And what do you want to do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:38]** So here's can't move, but he can.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** Well, I guess he can move.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** Double move, you said, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:44]** You can double move and then do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:49]** Yeah, I think you would need to use a move action to put the glove on to use it or to manipulate item, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** I think it would take a move action to put it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:55]** And then your standard action would be to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** But you have Magic Missile already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** But he's out of spells.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** I'm out of spells.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** That's why I got to sleep every now and again.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:02]** Otherwise, I'd be throwing them all over the place.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** I thought we slept.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:03]** I'm so confused.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:05]** We did, but I had to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** We had a thing to attack.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** I can't say anything at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:14]** And John said we're never going to be able to sleep again on this adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:17]** He said that if you do, it will be risky.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** It's not going to be a full rest.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:18]** Yeah, it won't be a full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** We're f***ed, man.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:21]** We're not going to make it out of this game.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:23]** All right, well, here's what's on the glove.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:24]** All right, you put on a glove.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:28]** It feels like a baseball mitt because it's kind of big.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** It's a little oily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:31]** I'm sorry.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** But he will also tell.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:35]** Yeah.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:38]** Electrovor to attack the dinosaur right there.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:39]** Another tail slap.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:43]** Give me a roll on that sweet tail slap.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:46]** Another potential love tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** No, we're not letting that happen this time.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:48]** That was an 18.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:51]** And then a plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:52]** That was a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:54]** No, no, plus nine is to the plus nine to that.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:55]** So it was a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:55]** Dang.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:56]** Yeah, that hits.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:57]** That hits easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:01]** So that is three plus three.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** So you get six damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** Six damage.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:04]** Nice.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** Also bloodied.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:06]** All right.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** Also bloodied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:10]** So wait, there are two creatures bloodied now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** Both creatures are bloodied.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:15]** The one that's in front of you in the middle is so close to death.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]** You can tell that it has been pondering Dr.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:18]** O.K.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:22]** 's questions and is sad that his conversational buddy is down from him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:25]** Then the third one's going to pop up with full health and be like, F*** you both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:26]** Yeah.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:31]** Dr. Okay, what are you going to do on your turn?

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:32]** You're down.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** Can I do anything?

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]** You can spend, I believe, a resolve point.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** To stabilize?

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:40]** We are in the rules territory where we're going to follow the rules.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:42]** I think you can spend a resolve point to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** Well, I'm obviously going to do that.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** Yeah, I think you should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:48]** You're not just going to give up?

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:51]** Save my RP for later.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** I'm going to save it for later.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:52]** Not on Christmas.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:53]** Finish the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** I'm not going to give up on Christmas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:55]** Oh, yeah, it's Christmas.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** I can treat it.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:57]** No, no, no.

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** Oh, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** Yeah.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:01]** I'm not going to give up on Christmas.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:06]** I got the Christmas spirit in my heart, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:08]** We would play the Mariah Carey song, but we don't get sued.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:10]** We could play a few seconds of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:12]** We could just go record in a mall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:16]** All I want for Christmas is to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:22]** Stay conscious.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:22]** All right.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:27]** So if you stabilize, if you're dying and have enough resolve points, you spend number equal to one quarter of your maximum.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:28]** That's one RP.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:31]** You're no longer dying, but you're unconscious and at zero HP.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:39]** Next turn, I think if you're stable and have enough resolve points, you can spend one RP to regain one HP.

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:42]** So right now, your turn would be to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:47]** So I thought you stabilized at the end of the round that you got hit.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:50]** If that's the case, then I would say that you already stabilized.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:51]** I think you stabilized immediately.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:52]** Sorry, it's been a long time since I looked this up.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:53]** No, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:55]** We haven't had this because I think the last time somebody went down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:58]** Was it 20 minutes ago when you tore open Miko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** Are people playing?

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:01]** Are people on Discord?

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:02]** Right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:04]** Once stable, you are no longer dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:04]** Always on Discord.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:05]** I'm on Discord.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:07]** Yeah, Jeremy's on.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:10]** And Techbone514, but I don't know his first name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:11]** That's Benny, my friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:13]** Oh, okay.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:14]** Hi, Benny.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:14]** Hi, Benny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:15]** Shout out.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:15]** Hi, Jeremy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:18]** They're talking about something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:18]** Oh, good.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:19]** Injury and death.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:21]** Page 250 to 252.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** When can you stabilize?

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:24]** This is what we need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** If you are dying and you have enough results.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:29]** On your turn to immediately stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** You went down.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:33]** I can spend more than one RP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:35]** Can you?

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:36]** I think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:36]** That's what it says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:42]** So it says while dying, you lose one RP each round at the end of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:44]** I don't like that.

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:45]** Hold on.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:45]** I found it.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:50]** You can't spend resolve points to stabilize and to stay in the fight in the same round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:53]** No, but I think on the round that you get hit, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** Well, stabilize.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:59]** Well, so stabilize says on your turn and you got hit at the top of the round.

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:02]** So I think this is your turn, technically.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:04]** So you have to stabilize now.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** Next round, you can stay in the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:09]** Unless you have the die hard ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:09]** Okay.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:10]** Well, I don't have that.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:12]** And so I can spend a resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:13]** Stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:14]** To stabilize.

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:15]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:17]** So you're at zero HP.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:19]** You're unconscious, but you're stable.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:20]** You're not in any chance of dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:23]** I think you're good.

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:24]** Yeah.

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:25]** That's my turn.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:29]** I'm just going to be like thinking in my head.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:32]** What are you like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:34]** I'm thinking about death.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:36]** What is your subconscious doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** Yeah.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:37]** You're unconscious.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:38]** I'm unconscious.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:50]** I'm thinking about the death of myself, but also like everyone and the finality of all things.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:53]** And yeah.

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:55]** This conversation with the dromaeosaurid, really.

**[01:19:55 - 01:20:01]** Well, sometimes you meet a faceless dinosaur and it just punches you in the face.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:04]** Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:06]** Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:07]** Mike Tyson.

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:08]** You're right.

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:09]** Top around five.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:10]** Not Sun Tzu?

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Not Sun Tzu.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:12]** Not Sun Tzu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:13]** Iron Mike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:14]** There's no flanking in boxing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:18]** Top around five.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** There isn't.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]** It is that Dromiosaurus turn.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:23]** The one that is close to death.

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:27]** It's going to take a step up, a guarded step up, and it's going to attack.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:32]** I think it's going to attack Brick 19.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:34]** Because you've been trying to hit it.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:35]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:07]** Merry Christmas, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** Merry Christmas to Grayson.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:10]** And Lauren.

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:11]** And Lauren.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** All our friends.

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:13]** All our friends.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:15]** All our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:15]** Merry Christmas.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** Happy holidays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** Happy Christmas, everyone.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:19]** Hanukkah already ended, so happy Hanukkah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** I don't know about Kwanzaa.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:22]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:26]** Hey, you listeners.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:37]** You may have noticed that Nick Belcher, playing Nico Orion, is not on the show, or at least was not on this episode, and they won't be on the show anymore.

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:39]** And they've left for his own reasons.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:47]** And this outro is a little bit of just a roundtable of just sharing kind of what we want to share about it and how everyone feels.

**[01:21:48 - 01:22:00]** I personally am sad and disappointed that we didn't have the chance to work with Nick on figuring out a really meaningful way for his character to leave the show.

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:07]** But with that, I think, you know, his character will, what happens will be what happens.

**[01:22:07 - 01:22:13]** And I think overall, another impact is that, you know, Nick was leading a lot of our music design.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:16]** And so I'll be leading it.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:18]** I was helping him with it to begin with, but I'll be doing more of it.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:24]** And then we'll also, I think there will be opportunities for, you know, anyone else on the pod and anyone else listening.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:28]** If you're a listener, if you know somebody who's a composer, have them reach out.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:28]** Happy to do that.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:30]** Yeah.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:30]** Yeah.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:32]** Also, Nick will no longer be doing the intros.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:38]** You've been hearing for a while that our Dr. OK has been doing intros for the past few weeks.

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:39]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:41]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** How is everyone else feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:50]** I think I have to admit that I was the most irritated by this news.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:52]** Nick just told us that he had to leave.

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:56]** And I think it just bothered me that there wasn't any closure with it.

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** And that hurts.

**[01:22:58 - 01:22:59]** I hope I wish him the best.

**[01:22:59 - 01:23:00]** There's no hard feelings.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:04]** I think it was just a little irritated with the way it went down.

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:06]** But I think the show will go on.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:09]** The show must go on.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]** We have a lot going on here.

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:11]** It's going to be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:11]** Yep.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:13]** We got a lot of exciting things coming up.

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:15]** More things in store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:17]** Yeah.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:18]** Yeah.

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:25]** So, I don't know what we should or shouldn't say, except to say that... I think you can say what you want to say.

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:26]** Like, yeah.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:32]** So, it's important to have a cohesive unit when you're working on something.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:36]** And it's okay if things get out of sync and you got to discuss about it and...

**[01:23:36 - 01:23:41]** you know, not literally fight it out, but like talk it out and whatever, and then move on and come back together and all of that.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:43]** And it couldn't be done in this particular case.

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:48]** And our priority is this group in general and to you.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:53]** And so being that that is our top priority, this might be the best way forward.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:59]** So we're happy to be able to just give you the best possible experience we can.

**[01:23:59 - 01:24:01]** And we're looking forward to keeping that up.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:02]** That was really well said.

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:03]** That was really well said.

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:05]** I'm happy to keep working with these three guys here.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:06]** They're awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:07]** Yeah.

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:08]** Yeah.

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:14]** I mean, just to echo everyone's sentiment, Nick will be missed.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:16]** We're...

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:42]** grateful and we thank him for his contributions and what he brought to to Nico Orion and it's unfortunate we couldn't make a transition out really work but we understand how you know priorities change and we wish him the best of luck

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:43]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:44]** Yeah.

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:44]** Yeah.

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:45]** I do.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:50]** I just, I think, you know, everything else I've said, but like, I am going to miss Nico.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:51]** I think he was a good character.

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:57]** Um, you know, Nick told us a lot about where he was going to take Nico, even though we asked him like, please keep, keep something to yourself.

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:59]** So we have some, we want to be surprised too.

**[01:24:59 - 01:25:04]** Um, I think he has, he has a lot of very creative ideas and, and I love where Nico was going.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:06]** Um, priority shift.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:08]** And, um, absolutely.

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:08]** Yep.

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:11]** I think Nick, Nick himself, it will also be missed at this table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:13]** I absolutely 100% think so.

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:14]** For sure.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:18]** I think that there's a certain space that Nick and Nico held on the show.

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:22]** And I think that will be the space that he held.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:24]** We're not going to try and fill that space.

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:26]** You know, there are spaces for other people to come in.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:29]** We're not going to try and replace what he's done.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:43]** I think in general, too, it's just important to note that I hope that at your own games and what you're doing at home, I hope that if there's any conflict, that I hope it's handled well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:45]** Conflict's bound to happen.

**[01:25:45 - 01:25:47]** It will happen.

**[01:25:49 - 01:25:54]** It's where you have a problem when...

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:57]** I guess respect's not given to other people at the table.

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:08]** So just for not saying that this is the case with Nick, I'm simply saying that if you're at a conflict in a table, you know, keep it on the table and about your character.

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:10]** It's not like personal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:20]** I mean, this conversation, if you stray away from the Nick topic, I have left games before because I wasn't having fun.

**[01:26:20 - 01:26:26]** And that was a very personal thing for me, and I don't think I informed the people that I was playing with exactly why I was leaving either.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:29]** So I kind of understand where he's coming from with that.

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:30]** Yeah, totally.

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:38]** most people listening to the podcast has, has played on a table before that, you know, there is some kind of level of uncomfort, comfort, comfortability, discomfort, discomfort.

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:38]** That's the word.

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:39]** Yeah.

**[01:26:39 - 01:26:45]** Um, and you know, and it's, it's one of those things where you have to balance out whether or not, and for the podcast, there's extra weight to it.

**[01:26:45 - 01:26:47]** I think that's a very good thing.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:48]** And we talk about it all the time.

**[01:26:49 - 01:26:52]** We play this game for fun, but we're also playing for the listeners.

**[01:26:52 - 01:27:00]** So there's a little extra step that we do with each other behind the scenes to try to make it more enjoyable for the listener to hear.

**[01:27:00 - 01:27:02]** And that puts a little extra stress to it.

**[01:27:02 - 01:27:06]** But just in general, at the table, it's a curious conversation of...

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:15]** How far are you willing to step out of your own comfort zone in order to keep playing with some of your people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:17]** Yeah, that's a personal decision.

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:21]** And there's not going to be one right answer for you, whether you're a GM or a player.

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:24]** And I think that this is always something that's talked about.

**[01:27:24 - 01:27:25]** There's always two sides to it.

**[01:27:25 - 01:27:27]** There's like, well, let's just have fun.

**[01:27:27 - 01:27:32]** You shouldn't force people to not play the way they want or not, you know, like...

**[01:27:32 - 01:27:36]** Just bear the discomfort, bear the burden of being at the table.

**[01:27:36 - 01:27:41]** And then there's the other side, which is we're all adults and you should express what's going on.

**[01:27:41 - 01:27:44]** And if somebody is not having fun, well, then don't stay at the table, right?

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:49]** And I think the answer for all of you will fall somewhere along that spectrum.

**[01:27:49 - 01:27:50]** And that's okay.

**[01:27:50 - 01:27:55]** However you want to have fun, however it feels good with your friends or your family or whoever you're playing with.

**[01:27:55 - 01:28:06]** And from a transparency standpoint, we tried to, I think in general, we have done our best to talk about it in a healthy way and move forward in a healthy way.

**[01:28:06 - 01:28:10]** And I think that's probably the best outcome that could have happened under these circumstances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:11 - 01:28:11]** Yeah.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:16]** So, Nick, if you are listening, we wish you the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:17]** Yep, absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:18]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:19]** And you will be missed.

**[01:28:20 - 01:28:21]** Best of luck in your future endeavors.

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:21]** Thanks.
