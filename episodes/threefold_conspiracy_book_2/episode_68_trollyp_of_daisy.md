**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:15]** The troubles with the troll and its troublesome Tribble-like polyp are far from finished as our heroes fight to finalize the fearsome foes before the reactor finishes off the whole facility.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:31]** With his past failures behind him, Dr. OK, with the help of Hears, is finally able to terminate the reactor sequence from its sanitation of the station, but is unable to land a hit on the troll as he and Bernice flee to find cover beneath the reactor room floor grates.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:41]** Colin heals thyself and casts Wisp Ally to distract the troll Tormentor, and Hears does his very best, bringing his Electrovor into the fray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:46]** But it's Rick-19 who keeps the troll at bay, bringing the two-headed terror down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:47 - 00:01:00]** But just as their attention turned back to the troll's polyp, in the final moments, like Herbert West and his colleague Hans Gruber, the troll reanimates back to life, just as the gang thought fighting these foes was reaching a finale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:06]** Will our heroes be able to hasten their enemy's final demise?

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:10]** Or are they the ones in for a fatal surprise?

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:15]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:12]** Welcome to We'll Say The Podcast episode 68.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** Coming to you live on a Sunday in May.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Well, on a Wednesday in May.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** What am I saying?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** On a Sunday.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Silly me.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** And I got something.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:31]** Got a new little segment that I literally just came up with in the time between when we clapped for the start of the episode and when I said welcome to episode 68.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** And this segment is called something I came up with myself.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** Never been done before by anybody.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Ever.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** This is pretty groundbreaking.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** Ever.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** It's called Two Truths and a Lie.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Oh, this thing.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:50]** Every episode, we'll just do one person.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** Maybe it'll be consecutive, sequential.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Maybe it'll be random.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I don't know.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** I haven't decided.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** We could decide as a group.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** But one...

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:04]** I like this because I just want to share more about us because I think we're cool.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** So I want to share how we're all cool, right?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** I don't know.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** It's fun.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** It's cool.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:12]** Two, because I also want to get to the combat.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:18]** But also, I just want to shout out to you all and say who wants to go first.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** We're going to do one person and episode first.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:26]** So who wants to play Two Truths and a Lie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** I don't know how to play this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Okay, let me tell you.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:34]** You come up with one lie and two truths about yourself.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Could be crazy lie.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:42]** There are a couple strategies I'm thinking, you know, since I've never played before.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Trying to dream up strategies on the fly.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** But you come up with two truths about yourself and one lie.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** You say all three, and we have to guess which one is the lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I can go.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Question is, okay, Will's going to go.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** I'm going to put this out there.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:03]** Do the people who correctly guessed the lie get anything as a reward?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** No.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** It's true.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Bragging rights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Bragging rights, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** Can't Tef will say no because he just wants to get this segment over with?

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Or if it's because... It's a little both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** Call him A and call him B. Okay, okay.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Put that over there, two truths and a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Yeah.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** The lie is I really love this segment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:31]** Okay, so I just come up with three statements and then... Three statements.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:37]** Two of them are truths about you or your past or whatever you want and one is a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:48]** I have never passed the written test for a Class C driver's license.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** But I have one.

**[00:04:53 - 00:05:07]** I have never flown a plane and I go to yoga once a week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** I think I see your strategy here.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** So one is has a license without taking the written test.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** Two is never flown a plane.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** three is go to yoga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** What does everyone think?

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** I mean, it's obviously, I think it's the yoga one.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** It's the lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Everything about yoga too for the lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** Same.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** Will would have flown a plane or like had a classy driver's license, which I don't even know what that is.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** It's probably like a tank or something.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Who the fuck?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Yeah.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Normal driver's license.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** I've never passed it.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** I thought it was classy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** You said, wait, say again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** You never passed the class C. I never passed the written test for.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Venny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** There's going to be some stupid loophole that he took advantage of.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** I don't know.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:59]** He's like, no, I went through another dimension and then got it and then came back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** I get a lot of vibes from Will.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:08]** He strikes me as maybe found a loophole to get through the written test.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** That's more believable than yoga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:16]** The yoga is the least believable of the three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** See, this is why this segment's good.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:24]** I've never actually seen Will, though, so maybe he's low-key, super flexible.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** No, I... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** I am pretty flexible.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** I'm going to go with the... I don't think he has time to go to yoga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** I'm going to go with the, like, other one then.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** Maybe... I'm going to go with... No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** I'm going to go with he does... I'm going to go with the... Fuck.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** What was I going to say?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** The first one's a lie.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** The Class C license.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** And then the yoga, I'm going to say is the truth.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** So I'll say number one is a lie, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:53]** For the listener, we're on Zoom, and Will just, like, moved his camera to look at his feet, and he's in, like, I don't even know.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Full lotus position.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** Crisscross applesauce.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** Full lotus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** In an office chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Ankles to his ears.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:59 - 00:06:59]** Yeah.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Yeah, Will's foot is next to his face at this point, so it's good.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** All right, Will, which one is it?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** I've never flown a plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** No way.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** That's the last one I expected to be false.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** We all got duped.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** See, this is why it's good.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** This is why it's good.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** I never knew that.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Interesting.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:28]** The story behind passing my driver's license test exam without taking the written test is they gave me the wrong written test, and I failed the truck driving exam by one.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:32]** So they gave me the wrong test, and so they just gave me a pass.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It was their mistake, so they were like, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:46]** Yeah, they were like, you only got one wrong, or you got one more than you're supposed to on the commercial truck driving test.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]** Because there was a bunch of like...

**[00:07:48 - 00:08:07]** shifting gear like half gears and like all these like regulations for trucks i'm like oh i could guess this then yeah i got four wrong you're only supposed to get three wrong but they were like wait a second you're not taking the commercial truck driving exam for like a class a license no i'm 16

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** They gave me a pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** But, Will, I feel like at 16, you look like you're 25, probably.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:13]** Yeah, probably.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:18]** You look like you'd already had a couple hard seasons as an ice road trucker.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Yeah, I was already buying beer.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** Yeah, yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** I want to know Jeremy's thoughts on these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** Yeah, as an actual trucker, let us know in the Discord, Jeremy.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** And if you're not on the Discord, you should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** He's definitely on the Discord.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** No, but I'm saying... Oh, there's other people.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, just join the Discord.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Just do it.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** We had a couple of new people join recently.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** It's good times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** It's good times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:49]** Well, thank you for indulging me in our first ever Tootsies and Lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** It's hard, but it's good.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** It's good.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Are we actually going to hold this up every week?

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** Because I'm not going to remember doing this, and I'm going to have to rack my brain for a good...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** A GM never forgets.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** So, yes, you're good.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** You're good.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** I will remember next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** Let's play.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Let's get into it.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Because you want to know what?

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:22]** After Frog died, I'm just going to confirm what you said earlier, Rick, which was that, yes, you were one away from putting the troll at zero hit points when you shot it.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** If you had dealt one more, it would have been down a round earlier.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Rough, rough times.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Rough times.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** But then you guys are in the classic troll quagmire.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:38]** Classic troll problem hitting you in the face.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** Giggity, giggity.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Giggity, giggity.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** And that's what Steven says.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Steven leans back up.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:51]** The quantum troll leans back up after being bullseye-ed in the eye by Rick19.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:57]** And I just want to say that...

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** It was down at zero.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Back now.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Back up.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** And it was the... It was Rick19's turn.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** I'm going to come back to you, Rick.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:16]** Just want to ask what you're thinking at the end of your turn as you shot the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** Rick's actually just like... He just wants to get this over with.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:27]** He's just tired and worn out and he just wants to...

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:32]** finish whatever the hell's going on, and get out of this predicament.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:38]** So he's satisfied that the troll's down, and when he sees that thing get back up, it's not like he's shocked by it.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** It's more just, like, frustrated and exhausted.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** He's just like, ah, man, this is... Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Ah, dang it.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** I mean, look, if I... I killed one character.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** If I can kill another while the troll is regenerating, I'll be happy.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Satisfied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Maybe he wants to take out Rip.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** Nope.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** It's not going to happen.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Maybe he wants to take out Colin.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** He put this crazy wispy thing all over my head.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** We just got Colin.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** So annoying.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** What is it to stand up from prone?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** Because the creature, the quantum troll, fell prone with a shot in the eye.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** I think it's a standard action or move action?

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** I thought it was heavy.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** It's a move action.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** We're waiting on Kev to confirm.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** I'm also about to sneeze.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Sneeze right into the mic.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Let everyone hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** San Ray bless you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** May Saturday bless you.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** It's a move action according to this handy-dandy cheat sheet we have in our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Yeah, I always forget about that.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** But yes, prone.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** If you're lying on the ground, you are prone.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** When prone, you take a minus four penalty to melee attacks.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** You gain a plus four.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** If knocked down, zero gravity, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** It doesn't even say what it takes to go.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Standing up isn't in that section.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** No, that's silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Nope.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** All right.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** All right.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** But it's a move action.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Okay.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** Troll takes a move action to stand up.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** And I think you know what the troll is going to do.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** The troll is pissed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** Under move action, stand up.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** That's all it says.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** The special form of move action allows you to stand up from a pro position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Love it.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Love it.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** Love it.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Okay.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** The troll.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:35]** Phases out of existence and then phases into existence right in front of Rick 19 standing and stepping right near Frog's body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Oh, no.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Yeah, he's close.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** So to everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** That's not cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Yeah.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Thanks, Troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Steven, whatever his name is.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** Hey, you guys okay?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** You good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** No, we're not.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** No, get away.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** We don't like Steven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:12]** As he steps next to Frog, Colin, maybe you were looking at where Steven was, just agape at the fact that this troll is back up after being shot, missing a head, being shot in the eye.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:17]** And I think Rick and Colin, actually I think all four of you,

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:22]** See, in the back of Frog's head, you see his skin start to pulse.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** And then explode.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** No.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** As Frog's head explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Get out of here.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** That's not necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:34]** Okay, like a minute or two later, that's messed up.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** It explodes.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Because it had a cortex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** That was unnecessary, John.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Oh, it's necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Oh, these graves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** It's necessary.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Frog's head has exploded.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** There's a giant quantum troll that has come back to life in front of you.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** What are you going to do?

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** You guys need to bring the heat.

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:00]** Reminder, again, we talked about the fact that as a troll, you do need to deal.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** You discover this, I think, in the first episode with combat.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** You need to deal either...

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:23]** Three points or three different, sorry, more than one energy damage type during the same turn or three or more energy types in a given round in order to turn off the regeneration for that round and then kill it in that same round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** I'll go, but I think we have a question from Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Yes.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:38]** So, for the listener, I'm looking at the map, and it looks like the troll phase over to sort of on top of where Hrag was, and then Hrag's head exploded.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** Does that explosion not do any splash damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** It's a small explosion, just enough to kill the person that's in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** Is this a cortex bomb going off in his head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:49]** That's what you would think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:55]** Kevin knows from personal experience having shot some things that then exploded for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** You're right.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** I got really lucky when I got out of the Navy.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** They deactivated it.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** No, get out of here.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** No, just in game with this murdering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:09]** And I like that Vinny asked because it makes sense that Colin might not have seen this.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** Right.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Colin hasn't seen this happen.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** That's correct.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Makes sense.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:20]** I'm pretty sure this is the first time Colin's ever witnessed a Cortex bomb going off inside someone's Cortex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** For lack of a better word.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:28]** Not to put too fine a point on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** It is now confirmed to Hears that Frog is indeed dead.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:40]** And then he gives a slight eyebrow at Rick, but then he's like, no, it must have been the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Rude!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:50]** And then he's going to tell he's invisible, but he just kind of, like, shouts from, like, near the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** It's like, Electrovor, hover just above that troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:02]** And Electrovor moves kind of, like, to here.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Yeah.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Could you move in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Oh, yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** Let me give you control, too, so you can have control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:14]** The Electrovor would incur attacks of opportunity for both the Trollope and... Motherfucker.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** troll at that point, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** It would.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** I forgot to specify.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:24]** He goes up into the air beyond their reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** I think he would still incur an AOL from either of them if they want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:35]** You're right, because he's next to the troll currently, so when he goes to fly, he's leaving the threatened square.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** As he passes through the trolls, he's definitely passing through, because the troll has a tinfoil reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, I don't think the troll is going to do that because the troll is intently focused on the person who took it out.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Both his heads.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Stevens.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Yep.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** You troll.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** But the troll up.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Go ahead and f*** that, John.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** But the troll up will take an AOL.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** So you should be able to move the Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** All right.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** Electrobor is going to move.

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** Okay.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** I'm going to do a roll.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** What did I get?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** I got a 20 again to hit you.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Yeah.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** On the AOL.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Sorry.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** 11 more points of damage.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Is the Electrovor alive?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** He's still alive, but just barely.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Just barely.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Okay, make a reflex save.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** DC 12.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:34]** As you're flying up, this goo slaps and hits you on the underside of the underbelly.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Oh, you failed?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Yeah.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** Oh, dude, you are entangled.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Okay.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** You are entangled.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** So what does that mean?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Let me look up entangled.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** I think your movement speed is halved.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:57]** So you might be able to still move to get within range of the troll, but I think you would need to... I think you would need to... Sorry, I'm, like, angry right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** I'm really angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** I know.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** I know.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** I know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Good.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Good.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** So his range is reduced.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** His range of movement is reduced, I'm guessing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:12]** Uh, yeah, Entangled is... Look, as I always forget.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Me too.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:19]** Half speed, can't run or charge, minus two penalty to AC attack rolls, reflex saves, initiative checks, dex-based skills and ability checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** All right.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** So would you just move somewhere closer to the troll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** I guess, like, he would move...

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Yeah.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Hold on one second, please.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** 10, 10, 10.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** We need here.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** He's going to move here.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** He's going to move here just to be.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:42]** I'll put it in next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:42 - 00:19:08]** okay okay so that's still half speed there we go that's right so okay got it so yeah so i can kind of imagine the electric war flying up getting hit and then trying to like self-correct moving through the ladders and moved from the southwest corner of the room to the northeast right above the troll like he's very high up go pro yeah what's what's the height of this room sorry i interrupted you great question

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** I thought it was a good 20, 30 feet.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** It is.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Yes, 20 feet.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** Okay.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** Yeah.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** 20 feet up.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** So how high does Electrovor go?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** So he goes up like 10 feet.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Goes up 10 feet.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Okay.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** All right.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** It's flying.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Flying.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Love it.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Love it.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Yeah.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Okay.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** That was the Electrovor's turn moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Yeah.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** So he will.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:46]** So here's again from nowhere, just shouts out out of the invisibility, like, use electrical discharge.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** And then he does.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Okay.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Which...

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:59]** Okay, so it has to pass a 13, a DC 13 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:02]** DC 13 reflex save.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** What did I roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** Passed.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Okay, so he's going to take half damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** How much damage?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** One second.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** This is key.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** Yeah.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** And it's electricity damage.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** And so...

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Um, so, oh, not bad.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** So it's a six plus two.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** So minus half.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** So that, that was an eight.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** So he takes four points of electrical damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** Four points of electrical damage.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:45]** And you can see the troll be a little sluggish as I feel like the electricity starts to shock the muscles and its legs twitches and it like is unstable.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:53]** It's very close to death and you have dealt one energy type of damage, electricity, to the creature.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:02]** And what I want to do is I want to say that... Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:14]** Okay, so you have to deal at least two more if you're going to turn the regeneration off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** And how long does that turned regeneration off last?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** So it just says one round, or it says during the same turn.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:29]** I feel like it makes the most sense to have it be a turn from the troll's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Where it'll not be able to regenerate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** Right, yeah.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** So because the troll regenerates on its turn, so it makes sense that it would be until its turn again.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** So it's the top of round seven.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** Here's can still go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Here's can still go, that's right.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** So then here's like...

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:55]** bleeps into the room from the invisibility, his gun aimed, or I should say his hand aimed at the troll.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Nice.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** And like fires fire damage at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Fires fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** With a cantrip called Energy Ray.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** It's actually a level spell.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** It's called cantrip for some reason on Hero Lab, which is interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** But yeah.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Question.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Yes.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** You're shooting a gun.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:21]** You're shooting a rage weapon within a threatened space of the troll.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Yeah.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** So the troll's going to take an AOO on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:31]** I'm going to roll this giant arctic disco die I got from Kraken.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** It's going to claw you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** I crit.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** Crit what?

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Success.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** On you.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** No.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** Yeah, that's a critical hit on you.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Wow, dude.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** So... This isn't good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** This isn't good at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** This is really not good.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** This is actually... I was just going to confirm with the rules lawyer.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:00]** I roll twice and I add whatever damage twice.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Right?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:06]** Or is it roll twice and you add the non-dynamic part twice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** You... Roll twice.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** You re-roll your damage both times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** God.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Okay, not...

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:21]** Not horrible, but 27 points of damage.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** That is still kind of horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** Yeah, it's pretty bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** I rolled a three and a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Here's is like a bug.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** It's kind of soft.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** If you just squish him the right way, it's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** But did he at least hit?

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** No.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:42]** Well, you haven't, we resolved the AOL before we resolved whether you hit.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** So dang, so a claw comes out of nowhere.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:51]** As soon as you appear, it's like the head notices you and then swipes at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** This is what I get for, I was just taking a risk for flavor and also to end this quickly and it did not pay off so far.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** But like, so here's...

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** Right, is casting his energy ray.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** So there's no saving throw.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** It's a DC 15, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** DC 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** It just says DC 15.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** This says no saving throw.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** DC 15.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** So I don't know what that means.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** We just sort of pass a normal DC check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** No, there's no normal DC check.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** So does it just hit hit then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** Can't be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** I feel like we went over this.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Well, one, what kind of energy is it?

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Fire.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** Fire.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** Fire.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Yeah, we probably did go over this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Probably did.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:39]** Energy ray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** This is dumb.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** I shouldn't have done this.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** But like, I don't know.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** If he comes down, we have to kill this guy now.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** I'm tired of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:52]** Also, you sure that you want to do energy fire?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Okay.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Fire ray at the target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:58]** Against its EAC.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** You can choose, yeah.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** You can choose any type.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:06]** I just might choose something else if you're trying to end this.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Because Rick said his was fire, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:15]** But if it gets it done in the same turn, then it's... Oh, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** No, you are right.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** More than one energy damage during the same turn.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Then it turns off.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** But I was just going to say you might want to foolproof it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** I'll just do acid.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Okay.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** That's what I was going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Fine, I'll do cold.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** No, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** Do whatever.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** No mitigating.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Ranged spell attacks.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** I'll do ghosts.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** That's what I'll do.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Yeah.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:39]** I actually just had to look up during our last episode because I was unsure of how to calculate it.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:47]** Ten plus your base attack bonus plus your dex bonus plus your spellcasting modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** It says you must make a ranged attack against the target's EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:52]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** So against the EIC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Here's his attack roll would be.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:59]** D20 plus the base attack plus dex plus your spellcast modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** Okay, what's your spell?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** What's that bonus going to be for you?

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:10]** Your base attack bonus as a fourth level technomancer is, it should say in Hero Lab 2 for that spell.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** But it's weird that it says DC 50.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** It doesn't say anything about that, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:19]** I don't see base attack bonus anywhere listed on Hero Lab.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Just FYI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Yeah, I don't either.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** It's somewhere.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** I just don't know where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Sorry, Kelly, are you a Technomancer or a Mystic?

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** I'm so sorry about this.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** He's a Technomancer.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** That's what I thought.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** Yeah, your base attack bonus at 4th level is plus 3.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** So it's plus 3 plus your dex, which is... What's your dex?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** I don't have any dex modifiers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Oh, so it's plus 0.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Okay, so it's plus 3.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** And then what's your... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** I'm not sure what that is.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Sorry.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** What do you mean?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Which ability do you use to cast spells?

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** Looks like it's intelligence.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yeah, it's plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** So plus seven.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** So it's a d20 plus seven.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:05]** You need to hit the creature's EAC in order to make this work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** It's probably not going to do it.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** It's just like a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** I'm going to tell you right now.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** Total 19.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** That's a 19.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** You rolled a 12?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** No.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** I rolled a 5 plus 7, so that's a 12 in total.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Yeah.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** All right.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** It doesn't go through.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Yeah.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:30]** Well, that was... God dang it.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** I gave up my advantage by not being invisible.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** All right.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:42]** Well, this is something I got to remember for next time, because fucking this cantrip energy ray is not going to be so useful in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** I mean...

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:46]** I'll tell you right now, you had a 50-50 shot.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Yeah.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** With that bonus, you had a 50-50 shot of hitting him or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** Okay, here's his turn.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Sad.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** What are you going to do?

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** So I'm in the grate, right, and I have cover?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** You are in the grate.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:09]** The troll can't hit you with any melee attack, and you have improved cover against anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:14]** So could I take a ranged attack without incurring an attack of opportunity because of my concealment?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:17]** Yeah, because you can't take AOs with cover, right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Uh, no, because you're covered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Yep, because you're covered, so you're good.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:27]** Okay, and then, uh... And it used its AOL for this round, so you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:34]** Yeah, so I guess then Bernice and I are both going to attack, um...

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** because the troll can't take another AOO, right?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Okay.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Yeah.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Yeah.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** So you're both going to attack.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Okay.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** So I'm going to roll for myself first.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Okay.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Shooting with the Costa Jet.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:52]** I'm going to throw him with the basic inhibitor, which is going to lower his AC by two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:59]** Natural FN 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Yes.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Dang.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Let's go.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:08]** I will just tell you right now, he has one hit point left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Finish him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** Do an ungodly amount of damage, and it'll just kill him.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** Is there a massive damage rule?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yeah, you're not going to meet that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** You don't know that.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** It's a critical, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** You're not going to meet that.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:30]** So I rolled three twice on the Casa Jet, so that's 14 points of acid damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:42]** 14 points of acid damage as it hits the other eye that was starting to regrow and just eats away part of the face and stumbles back a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:49]** Bernice, having seen all this acid just fling in this troll's face, she's going to just fire wildly at it.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** And...

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** That's a 17 to hit.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** Against EAC or KAC?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:04]** I believe it would be EAC because the vapor cavitation pistols.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** Which is?

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** Electrical and fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Sorry, I found it in the book.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** Cover and attacks of opportunity.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:17]** If you have cover relative to an enemy, it can't make an attack of opportunity against you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** But didn't it already use its attack of opportunity anyways?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Yes, it did.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** That's what we talked about, Kev.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Old news, Kev.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** I wasn't listening because I was digging through the book and I can't do two things at once.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** I'm going to cut that.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** I'm going to cut that.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I'm going to cut most of what you said.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Don't cut me out.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** In this whole episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** That's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** You just get censored the whole time.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** So Kev, what are you going to do?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Oh, is it my turn?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** No, it's not.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** It's still Dr. O'K's turn.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** Stop talking.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Stop interrupting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** So Bernice does four points.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:50]** Two points each of electricity and two points of fire damage.

**[00:30:51 - 00:31:16]** bernice describe yeah bernice describe your kill bernice uh bernice is going to sort of just like flop open and then the like she's going to be basically for the purposes of flavor uh prone like completely wide open as a briefcase and this sort of like vapor capitation pistol just sort of pops up from like uh an articulated arm that's like a

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:21]** connected maybe to the hinges of the, uh, briefcase and then, uh, just fire.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** And then, yeah.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:31]** Uh, maybe, maybe there's like a little push, a little blowback or some recoil, you know, she like shifts a little on the floor.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Yeah.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** She's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:37]** The latches cling against the little flutter.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Great.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** I definitely think that the first shot from Dr. Okay.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Made the troll stumble.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** And then the shot from the vapor cavitation pistol, like,

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:56]** And the troll lands looking up with one eye, one head gone, the other head with one eye dead on the ground.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** You have actually taken out the troll and it will not regenerate.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** You're safe.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** Hears is not going to die yet.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Not today.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** Not today.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Maybe today.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** We've still got another.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** There is a troll poll up here.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Not at this moment.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:20]** There is a troll poll up, though, which I don't know what you guys want to do about it because it's now round eight.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Eight rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** God, it's a long battle.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Someone step on it.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Step on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** I think, I don't know.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** Colin, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** Let's see.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** Because you guys had some problems from this troll pop last time, so... Yeah, I think Colin... I don't know if I want to hand wave it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:45]** ...expected it to, like... Disappear?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:52]** Yeah, I think I expected it to be, like, sort of hive-minded to the main troll and not be its own sentient being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** No, it's its own being, dog.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Would you say that it's separate?

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** It's a polyp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** Would you say that the death of its sort of...

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** You know, Genesis.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Is it kind of like thrown it perhaps?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Maybe give it a little bit of depression?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** You'll have to find out on its turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** So, question.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:15]** If I move from its adjacent... Yeah, I'm not.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** That's a silly question.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Never mind.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:23]** Let's go with... Ooh, is the troll polyp a humanoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** No, it's an aberration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Oh, that's annoying.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** I cannot daze it.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:45]** um sure i'm gonna cast fatigue on it make a melee attack uh and uh i guess i'll make a melee spell attack which we've established before is d20 plus my base attack bonus plus your dex plus your stuff yes

**[00:33:45 - 00:34:11]** uh melee would be strength except uh according to this i can uh key ability score instead of strength if it is higher so i just add my keys twice so base of three wisdom is four so that's eight nine ten eleven plus whatever this d20 says if i didn't miss my little box

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Oh, that hurts.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** It's a three.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** It's a three facing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** So you got a 14 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** I got a 14 against EAC.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** That's a hit.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** That's a hit.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** I love it.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** I love it.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** I love it.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** I love it.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** Cool.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:33]** Now the target gets to make a fortitude save DC 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Don't you tell me what to do.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Fail.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:44]** So now that creature is fatigued for the next four rounds.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Love it.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Four rounds fatigued.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** Going to put the sad face on it.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Okay.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** That is all.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:06]** Actually, I want to move, but I think I am officially the party's tank.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** So no, I'm going to stay there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** So the polyp now has a minus one melt.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:17]** I wonder if you're officially... AC, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, reflex saves, initiative checks, and... Yeah, that's great.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** Strength and dex-based skill checks and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** Look at Will with the rules lawyer in.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** And reduced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** You're encumbered by one bolt.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** You know this just means that it's going to attack you and you alone, Colin.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** It was kind of doing that anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** Sorry, I was digging through the book.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:40]** Did I miss, like, is the troll officially dead or is it like... Yes, you met the energy types.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** You met three different energy types in one round.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:47]** Actually, before the technical round, the calendar round, let's call it, ended.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** And, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Okay, cool.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** I thought I heard that, but like I said, I can't do two things at once.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** If I'm trying to read, my ears shut off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** We overloaded its regeneration, thankfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:03]** You definitely see it sometimes twitch a little bit as the electricity is just dissipating in the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:06]** And every time it twitches, Rick shoots it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** I didn't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I didn't kill it, I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** There's two of them, one for each head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Man.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** What do you want to do, Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** The pub is still alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** Yeah, and it's still pretty healthy, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:50]** uh so rick is gonna charge up next to colin because colin's not the only tank around here that's true that's right kevin's a good tank i just i can't get my mouse over to my i'm just saying he may have more health and higher ac maybe maybe well i can't move my mouse right now onto that screen because my computer's supposed to go but um so rick is gonna slide over next to colin um

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:57]** Like right below Colin, so he's diagonal with the polyp.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:07]** And in that time, he's sliding his artillery laser behind his back and pulling out his axe, and he's going to hit with the axe.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Okay.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** You hit with the axe.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** I don't hit with the axe.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** You don't hit with the axe.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Oh, my God.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** I rolled a three plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Yeah, that's not a hit.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Not a hit.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Dang.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** The troll polyp's turn.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:25]** I think the troll polyp is going to attack Rick, who just tried to swing at it.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:33]** That is going to be, even with the minus one, that is going to be... Oh, my God.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Oh, no.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Yeah, that's still a 24 to hit you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Wait, with, oh, with a minus one.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Yeah, okay, all right.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** Wait, what?

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** With a minus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:47]** Yeah, it's 11 points of damage and you need to give me a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** I'm confused.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** You said a minus one.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** How did you get 24 points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** I did minus one to what is actual bonuses and what I rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Actual bonus, which is like a plus 48.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Yeah, it's bonus is not a minus one.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah, it's bonus is like plus 300.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** So it's just plus 299.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** And then you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** Now I can actually move my character rate.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** So I was here.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** Yeah, you were there.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** You were there, and you just took 11 points of damage.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:15]** This fight's not over, because you might die from one of these little creatures.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** I'll leave you guys and take it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** I'm into my health points now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** You're into your health points?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Yeah.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** All right.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:26]** It is the quantum troll's turn, and it... Polyp?

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** Yeah.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** That's a troll polyp.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** No, just a quantum troll.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** And it... Dead, though.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** The troll's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** Let me finish the description.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** It is its turn, and it just switches, and it's dead.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** So it's fine.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Rick shoots it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Rick, you occur to the AOL.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** My reaction.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Here, it's your turn.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** All right.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:59]** So here it tells the Electivore to go to here, which is not within range of that motherfucker.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** And then he's going to do another electrical discharge.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** Okay.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Yeah.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** Got to pass 13 reflex save.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Do it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** 13 reflex save.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Try to do it, but don't do it.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Critical fail.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Critical fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** Fuck yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** All right.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** So there we go.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** Critical fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Can I ask a question real quick?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** Does the trollop have the quantum reach that the troll did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** Uh, you haven't seen that occur in the past.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** I didn't think it did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** So what is the reach of this, this quantum trollop have?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Cause it's on the other side of that corner and it's a tiny creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** I thought it was five, which is why I got as close as I did.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** It's reach is 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:44]** How does this tiny creature have 10-foot reach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** It's a weird abomination, the way it shifts.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** It's got super position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** It has the quantum reach.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** He just didn't tell us it has quantum reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** It doesn't have the quantum reach.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** The quantum reach is really intense.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:00]** Let's get into this in plot armor because I want to keep the action rolling.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** We've got time.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:04]** I'm far enough away anyway, like the Electro War is.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** So, all right, cool.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** So that is going to be 1d6 plus 2.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** So I'm going to roll that right now.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** 1d6 plus 2.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:21]** So that's six points of damage, and then also it's going to be staggered as well.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Six points of damage?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Six points of electric damage, and it's staggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Staggered and fatigued?

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Yes.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** Damn.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Okay.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** Because the thing is that I could still kill one of you, so if I can get it out of this episode, I will do it.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** No, we're not going to let you do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** That's why I'm thinking.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Not going to happen.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** We're not doing this again.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Okay.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** We already killed Rob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** I don't know.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Rick is in his HP.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Impressive.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** What does Hears want to do after he's commanded his poke creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** Hears laughs, and then also he is... God, Lord.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Hears could do something.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** I guess Hears is just going to try to do another energy ray.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Why not?

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Okay, do it.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** So then it's going to be... D20 plus 7.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** D20 plus 7.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** All right.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** God dang it.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Why am I rolling so low?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** It's nine on total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Yeah, doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** What the fuck is with the D20 low rolls?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Dr.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** O.K., what do you want to do?

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** You're inside.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** You're a bit lower on the ground, standing on top of pipes and conduits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** Can I move through the grating to this other grate that's open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** Yeah, but you would have to squeeze, so you'd move at half your speed, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Yeah, I see Dr. O.K.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** just like... Sliding his way through.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** He's a slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** It's only 20 feet.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:42]** You'd have to move, yeah, you'd be squeezing against the roof of the grits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** And I'm a diminutive creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** You're not diminutive, you're small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** I'm like five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** You're a small creature?

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** I'm a small guy.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Wait, are you technically medium or technically small?

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** I think it's squeezing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** I don't know.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** I feel like you've been playing as a medium this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Maybe I'm medium.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Yeah, so I feel like you'd be squeezing, so you just move at half speed.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** So then I can get there.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:08]** Unless I, like... Unless you double moved.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** You can double move.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** That negates the point.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:17]** I'll just get up out of... Okay.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:23]** I'm gonna move to around here, I think.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Okay.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Where is he?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** Let's put this final beast down.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** And, uh...

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** So I think Bernice can kind of fire from where she's at.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** Well, Colin's in the way and Bernice is small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** Sorry.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:47]** According to Star Jamers, Osharu's are medium monstrous humanoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** Is monstrous just like a descriptor about like their shape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:56]** If you want to get into the anatomy of Dr. Okay in the Osharu race, I'm.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Glad to go there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** I feel like his shards are monstrous.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** That's a mischaracterization.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** I don't know, man.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** It's a mischaracterization.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** moves to the north part of the room.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:14]** Bernice stays where she is, but Bernice will have the troll up love soft cover from Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Yeah.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Okay.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** is going to shoot...

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Does a 14 do it?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Yes, it does.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** Okay.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** We probably established this before.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** Great.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** 14 hits.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Okay.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:38]** And then with the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Okay.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:42]** Don't forget this troll pop also has versatile regeneration.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** So to kill it, whenever that happens, you're going to have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** They've always had it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** What?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Are you serious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Okay.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:52]** So does.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Trolls, bro.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Trolls, man.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Six points of acid damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** That's great, actually.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Nice.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Okay.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:05]** As it sizzles away, probably Rick and Colin smell something really gross as it splatters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** Because he's got soft cover, we established, right?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Yeah, plus two.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** So he's got a plus two, so I have to hit like a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** And plus two.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Ooh, can only take a single thing.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:20]** But he also has a minus penalty from the AC.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** So he's at plus one to his regular AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** Yeah.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** Does he?

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:28]** So he's got minus one for being petite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:33]** And then plus two from soft cover from you against for Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:37]** But also he's got a minus one from the basic inhibitor I just hit him with.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Oh, I didn't realize that.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** And I thought Kelly like stunned him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Yeah, he's staggered.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** He's got a minus 2 AC.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:47]** Minus 2 AC, which negates the soft cover.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Gotcha.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** So it's still 14 for Bernice.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Okay.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** And, yeah, staggered only limits him to move or standard action.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Got him.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Also do it?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** We already counted that.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** It's minus 1.

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** So it's minus 2 total.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** It's minus 1 from the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** No, it's minus 2 from the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Sorry, you just said it was minus 1.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Okay, so it's minus 3 total.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** So basic inhibitor is minus two.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** Fatigued is minus one.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** He can only take a single action.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** It's either a standard or a move because he is staggered.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Well, let's do it.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** Get all the counting right.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** So that's 12 to hit.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** 12 to hit.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** I mean, yeah, that definitely meets it.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Because it was a plus two.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** It was a minus three, so that's 11.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** Plus two for the soft cover, right?

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** So that's 13.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** So it doesn't hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Does it hit?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** That hurts.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Close.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Maybe it hits right near Colin's foot.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** Colin's like, what's going on?

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Bernie's trying to shoot me in the back.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Sorry.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Sorry.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** But that is two different types of damage so far.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** So you would turn off the regeneration for this round.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So it won't regenerate when it comes back to its turn.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Keep that in mind.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** You want to do anything else with your turn, Dr.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** O.K.?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** No.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Sorry that that didn't work out.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** No.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** But you hit it, which was awesome.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** I hit it.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Bernice didn't hit.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** Is there anything else from the basic inhibitor besides the minus two to AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** No.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:19]** It's minus – I get to choose whether it's – sorry.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** Let me just pull it up because I'm sure people want to know.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** That's okay.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:43]** That a basic inhibitor, I can choose between a minus two to AC, reduce target's damage resistance by five, or reduce target's resistance to one type of energy by five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** That's cool.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** I think you made the right choice.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** So I did AC.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Which is what I usually always do.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Help out the team.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** Although there was that one time that you reduced energy resistance and it was perfect.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Yeah, it was.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Yeah, that was cool.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** All right, round nine.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Benny, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:04]** So let me elaborate on that groan I let out earlier.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** When the troll died, I never moved my Wisp ally.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:16]** So Hecklers R Us are moving from the dead troll body to the troll polyp.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** And let's go with...

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** Let's go with cover fire, because I really don't want to get hit by this thing again.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Okay.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** So... That'll work.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** Cover fire.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** I'm going to try to hit it with a telekinetic projectile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** Telekinetic projectile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Fairly low-hanging fruit.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** Make a ranged attack against KAC.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:56]** And that attack is... Survey says...

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:01]** I just can't win.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** It's a one.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** It's a critical failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** It's right in front of you, too.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** It's right in front of you.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** It's right in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Four feet away.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Four feet away.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:21]** I'm going to say that he mentally picked up a bolt that he thought was free, but it was actually still threaded in a bit and just didn't go anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:27]** You were pulling too hard on the bolt that was fastened that you pulled yourself into the bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Yeah.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** That's our turn.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Yeah.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** That's your turn.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Sorry.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** One more thing.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** Rick, you said Rick is into his health points.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Is that correct?

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Yeah.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** Take four hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** What?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** With what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** He just gives hit points.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:53]** Kev is so... He's so like, I don't want to break the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** I want your stupid hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** What a charity case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Can I roll over?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Can I roll hit points over to stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** John, shut up.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Hey, I know what I'm talking about too.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Do you?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:13]** Because Colin has magic abilities that let him do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** Magic doesn't let him change the rules, dude.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Actually, it totally does.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** Because I'm a doctor, that rule doesn't apply.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:27]** However, the question is, I think... Here's the ability.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** The ability is called Lifelink.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** I can transfer damage from an ally to myself.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:39]** Now, at the start, you choose an ally within 30 feet.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** You are within 30 feet.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, you're adjacent to me.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** Who's taking hit point damage and transfer her wounds to yourself.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:51]** dealing an amount of damage up to your mystic level to your hit points, and healing the allies' hit points an equal amount.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:56]** So I think I can only heal you up to your total hit point damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Except your doctor...

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** it's not an archetype, it's a theme, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Right.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:12]** So like my doctor says, if I heal you for more than your hit point damage, then it flows over into your stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:18]** So what you just read, the way that I'm understanding it is that you took four points of damage from me,

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:24]** And you healed me for plus up to four points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** I agree.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** I think it carries.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:32]** I think the spirit of the spell is that you are transferring hit point damage from them to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** It's hit point.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Just hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Okay, I'll go with that.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Then you only take one point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** And I'm at full health.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** I'm at full hit points.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Full hit points.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** Full hit points.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Cool.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** All right, now it's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** It's your turn, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:47 - 00:51:00]** Well, I'm still in this debate online with other peoples, known as Jeff, about when to use a full action to do two attacks versus one attack, and I just pulled my axe out.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:06]** So, like, I either pull my artillery laser out and shoot it, or I hit it with my tactical axe again.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Twice?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:13]** Well, no, because my tactical axe, I think I don't have a high enough hit point.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** My melee attacks only get a plus five, where my ranged attacks get a plus eight.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:25]** So, yeah, it dwindles down to statistics, and I hate statistics.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Okay.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:30]** I'm going to do a single swing with my tactical axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Okay.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** Oh, it's a nine plus five for 14.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** But this is a new round and the wisp is still up.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** The wisp is on it, which gives it covering fire.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:48]** And it has a minus two to its AC for seven rounds.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Minus three total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** So I get a plus two to that attack that you're saying?

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** Well, I don't know how long the fatigue goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** How long is the fatigue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Fatigue has another three rounds.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** Do we get a plus two to that attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** No, you don't get a plus two.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** It has a minus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:12]** It's got a minus five now because it's got the wisp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** Except the wisp is doing covering fire, not harrowing fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:21]** The wisp, covering and harrowing never actually affect the creature's blocks.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** It only affects either the person who is hit by the creature.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** So it's only a minus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Adding two to your AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:28]** Right.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Yes, against attack from death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Oh, it's adding to my AC.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Right.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** So 14 to hit whatever your AC is.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** 14 hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** 14 does hit.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** Yes.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** So I was arguing for nothing.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** That is a D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** That's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Bludgeoning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:53]** It should be slicing because it's an X. I don't know what that means.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Oh, my God.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** I rolled a three and a 12.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** So that's eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:06]** Eight points of damage as you cut through some of the splatter and it lands on the ground, spreading out.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:13]** You can still smell like a candle that's been snuffed out, but it doesn't smell as good as some of its skin was hit from Dr.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** O.K.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** 's acid.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** That skin probably just hit the ground.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** The acid hits the grate.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Pretty great.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Definitely looks like it is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** This thing's still alive, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:29]** Dude, it's still alive, and it is still looking not bad.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:32]** It's pretty good despite having lost a lot of stuff.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:38]** But it can't do very much at all, so it's going to attack Rick again because Rick was the one who just hit it.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Kid looks so mad at me.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:51]** It's a minus one to fatigue, to attack rolls as well.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:54]** That's still going to be a 29 to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** Are you waiting for me to say yes, that hit?

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Because you know it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** Nope.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** That's 13 points of damage to you, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** The fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** And you need to make a DC 12 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** I don't think I rolled the reflex in the last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** We're getting our ass kicked by, like, a puddle of goo right now.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** What am I rolling?

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** The trollop is no joke.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Reflex save.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Trollop with the wallop.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Trollop with the wallop.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** There you go.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** Oh, you are entangled as some of the goo hits your legs and fastens you kind of in place.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** It's a little sticky.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** It's like stepping in gum.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** That's not all of gum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** It's a separate ability, is it?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** It's just a thing it does?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:38]** It is a, yeah, it's called, it's EX, which is, what is EX?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Expertise.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:44]** No, EX stands for like a type of ability it is.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:52]** Does that get... I don't think it gets affected by staggered or anything.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** But I can't take reactions.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Or petite.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Yeah, I don't think so.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Dang, Rick.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** All right, that is its turn.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:05]** And it definitely regenerated some of the goo that you cut off.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** It's going to be here's its turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** All right, so its regenerative ability is still on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Yeah, because Bernice didn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Okay.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Great.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** All right, so here's Tel's Electr4.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:23]** Yeah, Electrical Discharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** So if somebody does two types, it's three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Extraordinary.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** EX means extraordinary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** Yeah.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:37]** If you do Electricity and then Acid and then a third one in one round, then yes, you will turn off its...

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** regenerative ability.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** I definitely thought that this was going to be like a gimme fight because it's the Trollope.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** It's really not.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** And yeah, it's tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Yeah, it's tough.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** All right.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:52]** So electrical discharge, roll a DC 14 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Just caught that between my thighs.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Okay, so you take half of the following damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** You sound like an academic paper.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** I'm so out of it.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Half of the falling damage.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** See in figure one.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** You take four.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Table three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** You take four damage.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Four damage.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Not bad.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Electrical damage.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Four academic damage.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Four academic damage.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** And type.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** It's good.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** It's just a bunch of red line.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** Rick, your health is kind of bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** I'm not doing well, but I'm all right for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Okay, if you're all right for now.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** For now.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:41]** Here's this going to attempt another energy ray, which he now understands is a D20, plus his rage attacks, plus his intelligence modifier.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Finally know that.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:47]** So I'm going to do this, and it is a 13 plus 7 for 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Yeah, of course that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** All right, cool.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** That's awesome.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** Finally, this fucking hits.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** What kind of energy?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:57]** I guess someone was going to do acid later, so it'll probably be cold.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** Cold damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Okay, so first it was electrocuted.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** It starts to melt a little bit.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** It starts to become all loopy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Sorry, how does the regenerative work?

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:11]** As soon as we hit it with three different types in the same round, or same turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** You turn it off for that turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Just for the turn.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** So you've got to do that every round, or every turn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** in order for it to not regenerate.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** And then when you do it, you have to kill it in that turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:24]** I'm not trying to be my own rules lawyer here, but frog is direct, not frog.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** Colin is right in the way of this energy rate.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:31]** Do I get some kind of disadvantage to hitting this little polyp?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** But you still rolled high enough.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Okay.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Soft cover, that is fine.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Okay, cool.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:38]** But maybe Colin felt like cool breeze on the back of his neck.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Sorry, Colin.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** Just pretend I was blowing.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** With like some mint that I just put in my mouth, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:47]** I think we need a summer breeze drop here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** Fall's coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Energy ray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:53 - 00:58:01]** I'm so glad you're our tank in our party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** We have a couple tanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Wow, that's it.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** That was perfect.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Amazing.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Amazing.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** All right, so how much damage was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** You take four points damage.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Four points of damage.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Okay.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Starting to look bloody.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Cold damage.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** Okay.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** He's got two types of energy.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Two types of energy.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** Ticking.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Give us third.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Ticking away this turn.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Kay, well done.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Dr. Kay, it's your turn.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** What do you want to do?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** You want to deliver?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** Yeah, I'm going to try.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** You're going to do it?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:40]** I'm debating, though, if I should go master control with Bernice and try to hit him with the vapor cavitation pistol without the cover.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:48]** I think what I would do is I would just fire away because I'd be wildly trying to just get it done.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** Makes sense.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** I got you.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:53]** So Dr. O'Keefe is going to pull out the Custodian again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:01]** That's a 10 on the die plus... What is it?

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** I think you... I think I hit it.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** I think you hit it.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Hell yeah.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Because as long as you have plus something, you hit it.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Yeah.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Yeah, you're good.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** You're good with that.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** I'm just trying to find out what it is.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Plus four, so 14.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Oh, yeah, dude, you're fine.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** You're fine.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** You're fine.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** You hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:23]** And, uh... Here we go.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Ooh.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** Eight points acid damage.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** All right.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Yes.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Nice.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Yes, his regeneration's off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Only for one round.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** I know.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** We've got to ice him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** But Bernice can still shoot at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Literally ice him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** He looks pretty damaged.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Yes, Bernice will.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** You've got to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** And so the soft cover negates two.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** Two.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** Yeah.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:52]** Yeah, so it has a minus one to his AC.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Got it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** Global.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Okay.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Okay.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Okay.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Okay.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Okay.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Okay.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Okay.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** 19.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Oh, easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:00]** Easy.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Right through Colin's leg.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Meg Collins.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:28]** college right through the five hole this shit like running i feel like the cold like iced part of it throwing the the trollop off balance then the acid started to make its like lower extremities kind of like wiggle a little bit and it can't really move it's already staggered it's already fatigued and bernice just lines up a shot and she does three points of energy and fire damage four energy types

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Definitely looks close to death.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:39]** There are like holes in its goo that it tries to reform, but it can't because you've hit it with so many types of damage to the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** I vaporized and electrocuted it.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Acidly and cold.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:43]** Amazing.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** We all did it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** And cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** You all are standing around this poor creature.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Colin, what are you doing?

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Round 10.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** First combat I think that we've ever had.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Ten rounds.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** Might as well be a boss fight, so it makes sense.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** This is the real boss.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** It wasn't the quantum troll.

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Right.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Troll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:06]** I'm going to use my lifelink at the start of my turn to heal Rick for up to four hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Hey, look at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** Do you have four hit points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Rick says thank you.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** He's such a pro.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** I'll heal for four.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Keep yourself together.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** Try.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** Thank you for your assistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:32]** I'm going to use a move action to change my heckler's R.S.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** from covering fire to harrowing fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Okay.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** That's a plus two to next person who attacks, right?

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Cool.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Love it.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** Love it.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** Love it.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Smart.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Play in the game as you should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Oh, this isn't an attack.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** It's just a spell.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Clutch.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:53]** So if this doesn't work, Rick's got cleanup.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:58]** I'm going to cast Mind Shunt.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Not Mind Shunt.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Mind Thrust.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Thrust?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Mind Shunt.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** I'm going to do it at the first level.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Mind Hip Thrust.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** You know, spell slot economy.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** Make a will save, good sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Will save!

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:16]** We'll save!

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:16]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** 22.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Wow.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** Oh, okay.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** The good news is that only halves the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Roll high.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:31]** That's 11 halved to 5.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** Oh my gosh.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** You're so close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** You're so close.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** Just stab him in the face.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** So close.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Rick, bring it home.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:50]** It is quite literally the end of Mortal Kombat where it's like... It's like unstable, wobbly.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** Just end it, Rick.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Do a friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** I hope so.

**[01:02:54 - 01:03:00]** As soon as Colin starts moving, Rick has already got his axe up and coming down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** One.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:07]** Five plus five to hit.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** That's a miss.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Hang on.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** Hang on, hang on, hang on.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** Yeah, give us that bath one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** He's got a plus two with the herring fire, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** You can do.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Bam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** That's a hit.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** Yes.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** Cleave it in two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Let's go.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Yeah.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Ending the boss fight.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:21]** Yes.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** The real boss is dead.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Love it.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:28]** And you have killed the troll polyp and the quantum troll.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** You shut down the reactor.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Dang.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** Well done.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** I think we need the applause drop, Will.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** I think we need that applause drop.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Where is it at?

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** There it is.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** Well done.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:54]** You're standing in the pretty eerie space now as everything is quiet.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** There's no sound.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** There's no rumble.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** There's barely any light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:26]** from the reactor there's a dead quantum troll a dead troll polyp and frog is also dead what do you what do you all do yep i just want to point out that reactors are reacting and not acting otherwise they would be called actors


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:32]** That's a really good joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** I like it.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** It's a dad punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:38]** On this show, is it a voice actor?

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** A voice reactor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** Did the stewards ever respond?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** Do you wait around and see if they respond?

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** I was just asking.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:52]** You guys are thinking right in this moment.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** The troll is done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** I know that Rick communicated with him.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]** He sent out a signal at least saying, like, hey, reactor's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** They haven't responded yet.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** So what do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** So Rick will point again.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:09]** He'll, like, click his ear and say, like, well, I forget, what was the other Stewart's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Gnarla and Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Gnarla, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]** Gnarla is, Shay is the one who was, Shay and his team were working on the other reactor.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Gnarla's on the Void Crier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** Shay, come in.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:25]** The reactor is down, and all enemies are down.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** What is your status?

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]** And he releases the button and kind of looks around at the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** What is everyone else doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** This is just sadly looking at Rog.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:46]** He kind of walks up next to him, takes a look at all his brains everywhere, and takes a deep sigh of sadness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:56]** It's at that point that there's a soft and whatever was left of Steven's head just kind of... Did Blue's head ever blow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:58]** Yeah, well, you blew Blue's head off.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** Yeah, when Rick shot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:02]** I blew Blue's head off.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]** I blew his head off, but Rick's just kind of walking around in circles with his four fingers up.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Code four, code four.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:10]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** No one knows what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** No one knows, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** What is that?

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** It's a police term.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** It's a police term for all clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:21]** Colin's feeling pretty... Further assistance is needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** But we do need assistance.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** I guess Will would know.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Colin's feeling overwhelmed.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** I can Google.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** Thanks, Google.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:49]** I mean, if you think about it, he just woke up in an unfamiliar location with a bunch of strangers and a gigantic rivener that he just watched eviscerated, fought a two-headed troll with four strangers and a briefcase.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:52]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:55]** And now he's just, like, taking in the aftermath.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:58]** Like, what the f*** am I in right now?

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** Yeah.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** How far does the rabbit hole go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]** I could use a 10-minute rest if that's okay with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:12]** I think we're out of danger.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:16]** It might be... I'm a little cautious, but...

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:20]** We might be able to take a small, short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:27]** Doctor, how much longer before something else happens with this reactor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:30]** From what I can tell, it's just turned off.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:35]** We're probably just on emergency power right now.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:37]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:37 - 01:08:00]** here sits down in the computer chair takes out the uh shout out shout out yeah shout out to traveling on emergency power uh if you haven't already uh check out our our uh uh crossover with uh yeah with emergency power with emergency power and hex grid heroes here's fanfic that's good yeah that's good um

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:06]** So he just kind of sits down and takes out that Rolupuck, the puck that Rolupuck gave him again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:12]** He doesn't need to rest, so he's like, I'll stand and watch for you guys if you need to close your eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:15]** And just kind of focuses on it and thinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** So can I take my ten minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Yeah.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** Again, it seems fine.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** There doesn't seem to be any...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** I don't trust you, John.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** Okay.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:30]** Yeah, it's good that you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** So you take 10 minutes.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** There's a moment you guys are thinking.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:40]** Colin's a little, Colin's taking everything in.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Dr. K, what are you thinking?

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:47]** Oh, I'm sure Electrovor goes back into its pokey device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:47]** Yeah, he does.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** To stone, yeah.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** He flies back over.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** Crawls and hears this little jacket.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** It's cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Yeah, he's cute.

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:00]** Dr. Okay is just looking around the room, investigating.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** He doesn't need to take any rest.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** He didn't actually get hit.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:20]** And yeah, I mean, he's kind of investigating maybe the troll and like trying to learn more about maybe what the greys did and like what this facility is and, you know, what may have caused this reactor to get destroyed.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:27]** You know, turned on to sanitize mode, like maybe who did it or their motives.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:27]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:33]** You remember that it was probably put into sanitize mode as a reaction to the bombardment from the Void Crier.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:34]** Got it.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:35]** Yeah.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** So that wasn't anybody in particular.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** That was just the system itself.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** But you've ever ridden that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:55]** After the ten minutes, Rick's going to walk over and kind of do like a last rites for Hrag, kind of like lay him back, cross his arms over his chest, and kind of just like give him last wishes like, you know, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** Thank you for fighting with us.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Thank you for fighting with us.

**[01:09:59 - 01:09:59]** Brave.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** He says you're welcome.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Brave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** Oh, shit, you're alive.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** I was alive the entire time.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** I've been here.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** He can also regenerate.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:09]** Rick shoots him.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:09]** Yeah.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** Just kidding.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:12]** Sorry.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:14]** Didn't mean to take away that moment.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** It's nice.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:16]** It's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:27]** Maybe it's as you're... Dr. O'K, you think that if you want to maybe take a specimen of the troll, you can do some more.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:32]** Look, in 10 minutes, I mean, you can definitely see there's a lot of heavy modification.

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:34]** It seems like they probably have something.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** They have a quantum power source somewhere else.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]** So this reactor is to help power, obviously, the station.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** Yeah.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** But they probably have a source of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:44 - 01:11:08]** energy somewhere else that they're drawing from or at least is allowing them to get into that state of superposition and splice change things around manipulate whatever's going on it's probably just diesel it's probably diesel powered can i uh yeah yeah it's probably a bunch of hamsters some wheels powering it was there anything else on the computers that here's could find or was it just to power this reactor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:17]** Well, you do know that there's a connection, a monitoring connection, just to see what the power is for the control panel on the reactor door.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:21]** So if you wanted to, there is a control panel that would allow you to go into the reactor.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** To open the reactor, oh yeah.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:27]** Yeah, to open that door that's here on the left, right?

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:40]** And then also, you know, you do notice if you want to go in any further, you can see that there was a trap set up to where if you try and interact with this computer without a telepathic link...

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:57]** because the graves are trying to make sure that only graves use this, obviously you need it both, if you try to do that without, you look up and you realize that at the top of the room, there are four different, you can barely see it, there are little cutouts that are square,

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:08]** And you look into the computer and you see that there's a laser grid that would have come down and fired at anybody who was trying to access the computer without using a telepathic thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:11]** Traps in Starfighter are no joke.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:14]** That's how most people die in this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:19]** And the fact that one of the first things that you did was like just look at the computer and you knew immediately what was going on.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** You probably felt it too here.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** That really helps out.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:30]** And if – I think Colin probably could have done MindLink too at the worst, but then you would have been down having Colin helping out, right?

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:33]** Is there any advantage to opening this door?

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** I feel like we just barely scraped by in this combat.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Yeah.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Yeah, this was a tough combat.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:40]** To opening the door to the reactor?

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** Yeah.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:50]** You think that now that it's shut down and at a low power state, whatever radiation in there would probably be a low level if we're going to put a tier on it?

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:52]** It's really hard to go in, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** It depends on the power history.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:56]** It's at least 24 hours if you've been running it full.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** That's fine.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:01]** The point is that there's still residual radiation.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:02]** Kevin Decker.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** Kevin Decker, for all your power needs.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:06]** Bring realism to fantasy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:10]** Do you think that it would be worth it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:19]** If you want to see what the inside of a reactor room is like and you want to just go in, then that's fine.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:22]** It's very hard to open the door from the control panel.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** It's a really high computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:28]** I'm just making sure there's nothing that we should check out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:32]** It doesn't seem like it's in there, but have I planned for you all to go in there if you want to?

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:33]** Yes, I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:34]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** So if you would like to, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:43]** Well, here's – here's – does another comm call to the stewards and says, are you there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** Are you there?

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** Okay.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:48]** Yeah, it's probably – you're probably doing that.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:53]** Maybe you heard Rick do it, but you were busy looking and being like, oh, shit, there are like traps here.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** I already tried that, here's.

**[01:13:57 - 01:14:03]** And maybe Rick is your – putting your last rites on Hrog and saying goodbye.


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:09]** Then you do hear like... Hey, you're alive?

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** We made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** Affirmative.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:18]** Wait, I didn't hear what you say.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** I didn't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:22]** Okay, just checking.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** Rick confirms.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Come in, wait.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:25]** You're alive?

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:29]** We lost another member, but we are all alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:31]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:32]** We...

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** Yeah, we lost some people too.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:37]** Look, let's, you know what?

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:42]** Meet me at the airlock and let's get the hell out of here.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:48]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:49]** Very nice.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:50]** Well done.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** Good boss fight.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** That was a huge fight.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** That was challenging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:55]** Huge fight.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** You're safe.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** But it was challenging.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** You lost Rod.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** Hey, everyone.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** It's me, John.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:14]** It is currently, well, very close to midnight on Tuesday, the day before this episode comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:20]** And I'm thinking, well, I've got an outro, but what do I say?

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:27]** What do I want to share with you all, you wonderful, fantastic listeners and supporters of the show?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:29]** And I know the exact thing.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:38]** That we have hit 10,000 downloads of our show.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:48]** It is absolutely tremendous and amazing to see your support for our show come to life from just February of 2021 to today.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:52]** So to you, listener, to you.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:59]** From all of us at the show, we thank you for listening, for joining us at the table, for inviting your friends and family, for sharing Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:02]** And let me tell you, this is just the beginning.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:09]** We have some wonderful things coming, and we are so beyond stoked to share them with you.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:16]** So until then, as always, we'll see you next We'll Save Wednesday.
