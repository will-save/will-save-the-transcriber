**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:16]** Our heroes took a stroll through the Grey's Garden of Modified Veracinea Blooms and found another casualty, this time the dismembered corpse of one of their Grey captors, whose wounds were indicative of some fresh troll trauma.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:28]** But the real drama was the octagonal room with ladders leading to a green glowing cavern covered in troll claret and quantum flux that filled Hears and the Murderbot with an overwhelming sense of dread.

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:34]** Will our heroes live to tell a tale of triumph within this dreadfully designed eight-sided dwelling?

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:40]** Or is this the TPK cage match that GM John has been waiting for?

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:44]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** There are two things to talk about today.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:45]** The first one is very nice and easy.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:49]** Nice way to ease into the second one.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Not that you need to.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** Staying in.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** My first one is unrelated, and I gotta ask.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Full send.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Full send.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** I gotta ask.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Set it hard.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** What...

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** is the deal with Evian water.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:12]** Like, when I was in fifth grade, my teacher...

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** was like, you know, Evian spells naive backwards.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** And as a fifth grader, my mind was blown.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** And I was like, wow, that's so cool.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** And then we all had Evian water and it sucked.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** What, Vinny?

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Shout out, Miss Williams.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Shout out, Miss Williams.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** Fantastic.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** You had Miss J. Smith.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** She probably listens to the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Wait, was this also your teacher?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Miss Williams.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** No, Vinny had Miss J. Smith, who was super rude.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Yeah, she was.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** But we were right next door.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Oh, I'm sorry, man.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** Yeah, she was nice when you were older, but, you know, as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:46]** Did you guys, like, line up for recess, like, outside, you know, to come back in, and then you could, like, see each other from across the lines?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, we were also patrols.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Class.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Patrols?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** What kind of school did you go to?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** Like, hall patrol?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:55]** You would go through and, like, tell people, like...

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:59]** Do you have like an orange hall monitor thing?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** Excuse me, do you have your pass?

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Where are you going?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I feel seen, Kelly.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Don't do that again.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Oh my god.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** I feel like that would be more Kevin, though.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, that's very hombre.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** But I just gotta ask, what is your favorite...

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:37]** regular water because i had everything on the other day and it was freaking delicious and it used to be horrible and then i was also told that like aquafina is really bad i'm like aquafina has always been great poland spring this is the most random question i've ever heard but it's been plaguing me for days i'm not gonna lie i literally thought about it and i was like i'm gonna i'm gonna ask the guys on the show because i want to know

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** How did Evian get to be so good?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Because he used to be really bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Well, it's not Dasani.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** I'll put it that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** No, it's not Dasani.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Everyone universally hates Dasani.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It tastes like copper.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Yeah.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Like personified in water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** I'm going to let the Florida man in me come out.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Zephyrhills or bust.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** What the f*** are those?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** It's so good, though.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** I can never find it like north of Georgia or west of Alabama.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** So take that for what it's worth.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:09]** If not that smart water, it tastes like nothing, which I think water should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** That's smart.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** I stick with tap water.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:18]** Granted, I definitely taste the water first and I'm like, yeah, this is terrible.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I'm not going to drink tap water.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** But where I live right now, tap water is fine.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** And in California, tap water with a filter, good.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** It's spelled T-A-P.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That's very Kevin of you.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** I get my fluorides and my nanobots from it.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:37]** But the best water that I've ever had, the best tasting water ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** Nuclear water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Yeah, it's steam distilled seawater.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I knew it.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** The first distillation down to like 30 parts per million.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** Way to flex on us, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** It is delicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** I drank the ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** It's not that rare.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** 75% of the earth is covered in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** No one drinks the ocean, though, Kevin.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** Like you do.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** He did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** He did.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:06]** I'm really curious if you guys ever tried to distill anything else in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** I never did.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** I'll be honest with that.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** There's a whole thing about torpedo juice.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Torpedo juice?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** It's like alcohol made in the torpedo room.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** I was never involved in any of that kind of stuff.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I'm actually not aware that it was ever done on my boat.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** I'm sure some corn mash in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** You'd be alright.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** You just got to be friends with a cook, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Just a fun fact for you guys.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:39]** The steam, nuclear power is steam-related, so we boil seawater and make pure water to use as our steam flow.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:45]** So we have pure water boiling off and turning into steam, and that's used to propel the ship and power it.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:48]** But that steam is then used to boil more water.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** So it's a repetitive process.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** It's called efficiency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yep.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Heck yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Heck yeah.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** Well, speaking of wonderful things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:05]** I just want to shout out to the lovely folks in Maine who bottle Poland Spring.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Shout out to all the Polans that I know.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** No relation.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** No relation to the country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** Is it hand bottled?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** They're down at the river dipping a bottle?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** No, they're just the Polans.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** They know what they're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** No.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** You know what?

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** I'm going to go one step further.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** I think this episode is dedicated to Poland Spring workers.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** I think so.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Sponsored by.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** Thanks.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Poland Spring never lets you down.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Never lets you down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:38]** But I don't live in the Northeast, so I got to get my water the old-fashioned way.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** At the grocery store.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** From Fiji.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** From the French house.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** Evian.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** With a little slice of cucumber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** From Lake Titicaca.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** Yeah, Titicaca.

**[00:06:50 - 00:07:00]** My favorite water is probably Spindrift, because I'm tired of drinking regular water, so I drink water with infusions of flavor that actually don't taste like every other carbonated water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** I need bubbles and a hint of flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** I need one gram of sugar to make it taste like something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Yeah, just something else.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Which is what it is.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Spindrift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Check it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** This episode is not dedicated to Spindrift.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** My favorite water is Dr. Pepper.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** If you want to do a sponsorship detail, write to us and we'll send the podcast to gmail.com.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Dr. Pepper's great.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** And you drink it constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** It's water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** It's the same kind of water as Spindrift.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** It has more syrup and more carbonation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** You sound like a marketing exec, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** It's just like water.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** We should market it as water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Pullman, Dr. Pepper.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Water for Texans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:45]** I think there was a campaign one time that they were like, you know, soda hydrates you.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** And people were like, well, no, technically it's carbonated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** Wait, does carbonated water not hydrate you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** I don't know the science behind it.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** It does something to you that can cause you to get dehydrated somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:06]** If you live in Maine and know a Poland Spring worker or you know what carbonation can do to your body, then please reach out to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** Hit us up on the Will Save Discord.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** It's a pretty happening place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** We'll make a Slack just for health.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** Love to see you.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** And you know what the second topic is today?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Take it away, Will.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** What's the second topic today?

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Just knowing Will, I think it has to do with the date.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** I forgot what I was talking about.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Kev, you seem eager.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:28]** I'm not eager, no.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** I'm glad we're not in the same room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:40]** Today is 420, and if you're listening to this episode and you're enjoying all the spoilers of 420, I'm good on you.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:47]** And if that's not your thing, then find a place to go that is your thing, and then hit play on this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** I fully support Will's right to smoke as much marijuana as he wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** Whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** If he chooses to.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** I've never done that on air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** Is this story time?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** Stop, I'm just story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:08]** This doesn't feel appropriate for Stop Brand Story Time, but what does feel appropriate is Vinny's experience with this.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:14]** Oh, do tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** I want to hear it from Vinny's side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** Yeah, take it away.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:34]** do we want a tandem all right i may tap you in at certain points because you were certainly more more more coherent in parts of the story i'm on the ropes i got you so we went to uh hang out with our buddy jeff of rogue hexagon shout out jeff yeah rogue hexagon is awesome

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:59]** yeah went to hang out with him i don't even remember the occasion he might have just been hanging out uh so we are uh definitely um of legal age to consume this thing um we're chilling there like hey it's federally uh just frowned upon as well frowned upon not illegal just frowned upon perhaps at the time in the state it wasn't legal but whatever do you want to go color


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:10]** Maybe for some approval points, our benevolent rulers would like to inaugurate this day and just forget about it.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** So everything is legal.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Go ahead, Diddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Yeah, it's all legal.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Do you want to, you want to go color?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** I'm like, I thought coloring was a different activity.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** So I'm like, sure.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Yeah, let's go.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Let's do it.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:30]** So we pull up and there's probably five or six of us and we're, you know, you do, you do a thing, you pass it to the left.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:37]** So I had like zero context for how deep you were supposed to do the thing or how long you're supposed to hold.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** The thing.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** The crayon?

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Because you guys are coloring?

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Crayons.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Yes, the crayon.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Thank you.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** You let go when you're done coloring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:48]** Some people can like, you know, they crayon really dark and they push really hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** That's very true.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** So you're pushing really hard, I'm guessing.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:57]** Some people crayon, you know, a couple times and then pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:05]** So I only the first time took one swipe, one decently light swipe and like didn't feel anything.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** So the second time it came around, it took a little darker swipe.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** And, you know, I'm probably five or six swipes deep.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I'm like, this is boring.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** I'm not feeling anything.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Five or six paint by number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Paint by number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Let's let's bounce.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Yeah.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:26]** So Swan and I, you know, we hop into my vehicle, which is what is your vehicle?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:32]** It's a it's a 96 Jetta, but it's a five speed.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** It's a manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Hey, do you still have this car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** No, it's in a junkyard somewhere.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, I wish I did.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:42]** I almost bought another one like three years back just because I miss driving stick.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** Yeah.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** So we hop in the car and it's me and John and John's girlfriend at the time.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:53]** And like, as soon as I get behind the wheel, it hits me like a freight train.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** All the colors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** Just everything.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** All the colors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** All the colors everywhere.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** Like, anything outside of our car is just colors.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** And I had, like, a full-blown panic attack.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** John, John, I can't drive, John.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** I can't drive, John.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** John, you need to drive, John.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** So, like, he gets into the driver's seat.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** I lay down in the back seat.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** And, like...

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:23]** I'm oscillating between freaking out and also criticizing John's driving stick.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Yeah.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** Cause I didn't know how to drive a stick at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** So it was a very bumpy ride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** John didn't color it all though, right?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** No, of course not.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** No, of course not.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** No, of course not.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** We were absolutely safe.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** Yeah.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** It was all good.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Um,

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** Yeah, so, like, each of those swipes just came wave after wave that night.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** And, yeah, I don't think I have smoked since.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Excuse me, I have not colored since.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:56]** You just went full with that analogy and then ended up with smoke, yeah.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** And then I stopped doing pot.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** That's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Good times.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** Wait, was John grinding gears like all the time or was he pretty decent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** By the end, I feel like.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** But you might remember more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:19]** Kelly, do you remember when we were next door to the crayon manufacturer at our workplace?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Yes.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** That was a fun time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I do remember this.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:31]** Just get like wax fumes coming over to your... Yeah, we would get wax fumes, but we would also get freebies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Just free crayons.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Yeah, just free boxes of crayons.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** That's good.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** There was ice cream.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Sometimes we'd hang out with our bosses and, you know, enjoy coloring.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Ice cream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Okay.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** It was everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Wow.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** This is awesome.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** This was an interesting workplace.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** We also had beer on tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** We did.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** That's cool.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** And kombucha.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** There's always kombucha.

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:01]** Kombucha and cold brew are the new millennial office staples to have a tap of those two.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Yeah, you have to.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** And then if you have beer, it's a plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** It's totally a perk, though, because I kept working there for a while.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:29]** because of that it's the only the only reason i stay because of like and kelly and kelly but then i got kelly on my own so i was like fine i don't know exactly like i'm done and then here we are episode 64 having a good time not coloring indeed not not at all not for the episode that yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Well, I didn't say about never.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** I just said not for the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** It's cool.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** No?

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** We'll save retreat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** No?

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Okay.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Cool.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Yeah, we'll do that thing that we talked about at the We'll Save Retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Yeah, that sounds good.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** That sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Should we play?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** All of the things.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** And then we'll just never look each other in the eye again.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Let's play.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** It's like we're always going to record royalty from now on.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** We're on video somewhere.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:49]** If only, yeah.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Somewhere.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:50]** Somehow.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Until then, it is not.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** So, that's not the music I wanted.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** That's the music that I wanted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:03]** Also, shout out to the crayons you can eat.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** I love edible crayons.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Oh, the edible ones?

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Good stuff.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Edible crayons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Good stuff.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Will, was that you as a kid?

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Did you eat crayons?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** I never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** My son was eating crayons earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:45]** all right kevin's son aside oh no a little little kids it's fine but once you reach like third grade don't eat crayons anymore nobody should yeah or anywhere else like you know like all your classmates will hate you i hated those kids all right let's go so it is here at the mouth of this green light portal the green is so perfect


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** The green light streaming up from a hole in the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** John, are we supposed to see this?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** Okay.

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:11]** As you all have woken up inside escape pods from a ship that blew up, you have fought perilously through danger and fear against creatures that you thought these don't actually exist.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** You've lost a comrade and gained another in this struggle.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:37]** And now you are standing above the area where you think you might be able to cement either your escape or your assured destruction.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:39 - 00:17:05]** pull you guys over to uh world 20 what was that well i don't destruction assured really who knows we will see what happens it's harsh toke man on on we'll see so right now i should get i should get a thing for that but okay yeah no no it's not worth it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:10]** Hears and Rick19 and Bernice are standing in this octagonal room.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:21]** As I said, green light pours out of this somewhat narrow hole shaft in the ground with four ladders, two of which seem to be broken.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:28]** And we just ended when Rick19 had noticed that there was troll blood all over the ladders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** Oh, that was Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** Rick, you noticed it because you went in.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Then Hears looked at... You said I didn't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** I just got a sense of dread.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** I rolled like a two on my perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** No, I feel like you did.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** Well, I was going to... Way to spoil the sense of dread.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** You can't get anywhere with Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** Well, that's all I had was a sense of dread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** Yeah.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Well, that's all that you need.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** It's fine.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** We're going to kill Brick soon anyway.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** It's fine.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** So, this is...

**[00:17:53 - 00:18:10]** Here's you notice that the blood has some sort of multiple glitching positions as you think that there might be some sort of alternate reality or quantum super positioning that's happening with the blood from the stroll.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** It's very odd.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:17]** And Rick, you didn't notice this because in the back of your mind, you started to feel the sense of dread.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** Here's as you walk in, you realize that sense of dread is some sort of telepathic

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:44]** alarm related to the state of the reactor there's a moment here where here's and rick are standing inside dr okay colin and frog are outside yeah is there anything that you guys want to want to share with this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:51]** I think just before we go any further, like, I just want to say, like, the idea of a telepathic warning system is really cool.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Like, they're great.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Everything they do is telepathic.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:04]** And so, like, instead of this screeching lights and sirens thing that we would have on an actual reactor, like, they just hear this message that says, like, the reactor is failing in their heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:12]** Here's and Rick and I think Dr. K through Bernice.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** 19.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** 19 from here's.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** What about Dr. O'Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** 18 plus 6 for 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** Sorry, Dr. O'Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:25]** Dr. O'Keefe, sorry, Bernice, let's look at our perception.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** 17.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** 17.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** And Rick, what was that, sorry?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** 24.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:36]** You all realize that the blood, the reason it's on the ladders is because...

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:42]** It seems like the ladders are partially broken because this large creature probably like fell.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:48]** And again, it does seem like this creature can move without walking.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:57]** Seems like it can be almost in several places at once in a way because of the quantum superpositioning.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:08]** So it seems like it is definitely clumsy and was not trying to gracefully move down the ladders and fell and has splattered blood everywhere.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Like I said, sorry, there's a moment here.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** What do you guys, what do you do?

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** How much of a moment are we taking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:24]** Hears tells everyone, like, I can hear and feel something telepathic.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:32]** I think, and he's looking at Rick, you, I think, observing his face, like, that it's a warning signal.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** Ping.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** And I think it's coming from the reactor.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** It's probably close to blowing up.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** We got to make good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** I can sense it.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** I can feel it, but I don't understand it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** It's a system that they built.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:55]** It's like an alarm that you would hear with an audio alarm in our own world, in our own way of communicating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:01]** It makes a lot of sense that the Greys built their alarm systems off of telepathic communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Yes.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** One more thing.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:11]** This blood is shifting and probably between different dimensions.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:19]** Remember that robot that gave out those, those things, those glasses that I put on when I went to that other world.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:31]** I'm sure that whatever made this was there and then came back or that we're in some kind of, we're near a veil between those two worlds in some sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** No, you sound stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** All right, well, thanks.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** I just don't even have the goggles on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Colin is pretty confused at this point.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:49]** He steps into the room and says, do you mind if I have a look at this memory?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Say what?

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:53]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:53 - 00:22:01]** I've got an ability to transmit and receive memories, emotions, things like that.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Would you mind sharing with me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Can you please explain what you mean by that?

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:10]** What fantastical magic is this, Cullen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** What's this skill called?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** I might have heard about it or read about it in books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** It's a...

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** McCrown always called it Mind Blink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Oh, okay, okay.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Hears knows what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Oh, he's a mystic, isn't he?

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Is that a guess?

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** That's my guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** I think so.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** You're sensing magic.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Are you a mystic?

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** Because I dabble in mysticism myself, gotta say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Love the foreplay.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Love the subtlety.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** I am also.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** I could tell.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** I'm a Technomancer as well, and I know what it is.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** I'll let you do it.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:58]** Here's kind of gets on sort of cross-legged and sits down against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** Yeah.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** Cullen does the Vulcan three finger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** Sorry, question.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:08]** Is this a spell or cantrip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** This is a spell-like ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** So you're not wasting a spell slot or anything to do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Yeah, mind link is dope.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** So you're doing mind link to get the alarm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:26]** So what I would want... Actually, let me do this in character.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** Would you mind sharing not just the alarm, but that bit about the sunglasses too, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** Do I just have to remember or try to picture the moment in my mind?

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** I haven't done this myself.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** I only know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:48]** Um, it says you decide what the target learns, any amount of information that could be communicated in 10 minutes as, uh, it comes in as visual images and emotional sensations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** Okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** I'll try to picture it again and feel it.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** There is a spell resistance.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** A will negates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Here's will negates it.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Yeah, so that's pretty sweet.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:13]** You sit down and you do have this memory of earlier, at this point, maybe 16 hours.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** back when Nico was alive.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:21]** Colin, you see somebody that you don't recognize in the memory, but you're in this room.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:25]** There's a large display on the wall of an OMA.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** And it's like a digital display of this OMA swimming around.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:32]** And the whole room feels like a technical space.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:38]** And you do recall this sense of anticipation.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** There's tension.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** There's curiosity.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:47]** Coming from Hears as the group is trying to figure out what this being is.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:58]** This being that looks like a pyramid with rotating rings and gems that seems to be talking very casually.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:06]** And you can hear in Hears' brain the voice saying...

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:11]** Test subject number three, please come and get your experiment.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:17]** And then, you know, you like flash forward a bit and it's here is putting on these rad looking sunglasses.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:28]** And it's almost like you're looking into like a retro wave video because for a second you were seeing into another higher dimension.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:38]** And you look, here's his head looks across the room and focuses on an interesting point as the higher dimension melds with the digital display of the OMA.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:43]** And it's almost like here's intention is to be curious about it.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** And then suddenly here's his across the room.

**[00:25:48 - 00:26:18]** pulls off the glasses and then there's also you feel a wave of nausea for a second and this memory starts to starts to fade a little bit but then it speeds up it kind of starts to become a little little unclear is there anything that you want to add here's here's just says like that's that's that part where did you see that where i was there for just a moment and then flashed out i did i lost the goggles unfortunately

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:27]** Yeah, there's like a slight sense of remembering having the glasses kind of fade into that dimension at the last second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** Colin would know all this if he just listened to episode 46.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** Here's this like sweating and his brows are kind of furrowed.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** And he's just like, all right, I think that's all I can do.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** That was kind of hard to relive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** I believe it.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** I appreciate you, Sharon.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:54]** Colin, you felt as you came in, you also felt that dread too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** I have no idea what to do about it.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Is this where we make our final stand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** So what's going on in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Uh...

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:10]** They're exchanging thoughts and memories, Rug.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:21]** I was going to say, perhaps, you know, when we get down there, you may need something to help you get going.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** How long did this mind meld thing take, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I mean, it's instantaneous.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** It's an action.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Okay.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Oh, no.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Duration instantaneous.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Okay.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Okay.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** Yeah, so are you okay?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:41]** Do you want anything to relax or, you know...

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** Are you susceptible to anything that I should know about?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** Maybe I can help buff that rug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** I don't think I'm susceptible to anything.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** I know your reputation precedes you.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** I just figured I'd ask.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** How are you feeling, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** No.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** There were times when...

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:13]** Well, there are times in every gladiator's life where you feel nervous.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:18]** The threat of death is always on the horizon.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** I think it's just something you have to come to terms with.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** Never quite feels right.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:33]** But, you know, there were two things that I were told on my first day.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:48]** And then that's what I told all the new recruits when I would have my first match with them or I set them in knowing they might die or I might die.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:53]** I said, today we may die in case you forget.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:59]** But keep your blade held high so tomorrow we may live.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:08]** They didn't always catch that last part because the crowd's pretty loud, so I'll slap them on the back and say, don't **** yourself, right?

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Yeah.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:15]** So I think that as long as we don't **** ourselves, we'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** I don't really **** like normal races, so we should be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** That'll be a fun Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:31]** How do you... Well... What about you, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Are you alright?

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Are you ready for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** Uh... I don't know, Frog...

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** I'm a little overburdened at the moment.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:48]** Do you mind carrying this net in case we come up with some small creatures?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** Maybe you can throw it.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** I can't.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** Of course.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:58]** I'm a slug, but I wanted to give you this, baby, and help me not carry so much stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** All right.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Yeah.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** So you hand him the net.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** I mean, it's.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** The knife fiber net.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Yeah.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** From the droid or whatever.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:12]** It probably feels pretty small in like his palm, but he's like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Yeah.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** But to me, you know, very diminutive creature.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Yeah.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Skifrog all over.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** And then Dr. Okay passes out crayons to everybody.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Let's just take a moment.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** Let's just color and relax a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I like the purple ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** The perps are good.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Sour tangies.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** How was everyone's medical status?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** I'm doing all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:45]** Well, besides the time that John cheated and took away all my health using attacks that he shouldn't have, I'm doing okay.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** No, my stamina is about half, and my hit points are about three-quarter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** Weirdly, Krog loses it, reaches in, grabs Rick's face, and smashes it against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:53 - 00:31:04]** It's equal to the number of hit points that the two Skrillings did to him.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** I could use a boost in hit points and stamina if we have time.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** For a ten minute?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:18]** I don't want to waste an RP point to do that, but if... No, I've got some healing serum I can administer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Yeah, and I think you guys found some more, too.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** I don't want to waste a healing.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Thanks, Colin.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** You turned out to be quite the guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** I have two myself.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:30]** Do we want to waste any of these now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:49]** or should we waste is waste the term we want to use how low are you how much can it heal you i i'm at i'm about 10 points down hit points wise it's 1d8 hit points yeah but do i want to use yours or mine so i just i just burned uh i'd like to burn a serum

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:55]** Just so that I can regain stamina, just so that I can regain my biohacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Nice.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Yeah, that's a good idea.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** I'll roll a d8.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** But again, should I use my serum or yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** Use yours first.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** I'm looking for... Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Here's the ability.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:21]** Use yours first, and then I'll use mine because I also have the doctor special ability, which means any hit point healing I do that overflows goes into your stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Nice.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Okay.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** How do I just use my...

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:50]** how do you is there a way to just like oh i can roll spend it i'm looking yeah throw the math rocks four so it's just one d8 that you said yeah okay so i'm almost at full health dang rat yeah this one was a bit of a dud you only get two points for me okay so who gets healing dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** Yeah, I burned a healing serum.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** So I got four plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:01]** I used one of mine on Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** You used one of yours on Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** All right.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Here's Ask the Doctor.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Doc, how long does that boostage give me last?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** An hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** What does it do?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Or eight rounds.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:23]** So when you're next... I can either use it for first aid, but in this case, I'm giving you a...

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:27]** Medicine check to treat drugs, poison effects.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Okay.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:39]** And you gain a plus four bonus on your next saving throw against those sorts of items within the next hour.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Thank you.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** Yes.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** All right.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** Because I was a little worried about you there.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:56]** You were feeling a bit queasy and recollecting to when you put on those shades, it seemed.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** Believe me, I appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Thanks.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:03]** I'm sorry, but this sense of dread, it has me second guessing.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** I think I'm going to have to take a 10 minute rest and possibly use the relax you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Okay.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** That's fine.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** That's fine with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:37]** cool all right i'm gonna take 10 minute rests um what does it relax you do you get relax you do again it allows you to get i think it's 1d4 hit points back on a 10 minute rest right yeah yeah probably a d12 and you're just down selling it i would not do that i got a one it's probably a d2 yep sounds like you're manufacturing your own bad luck wow

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:43]** I will say if you're going to take the 10-minute rest in the room, then you won't get any hit points back.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** I'm just messing with Kev.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I'm just messing with Kev.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** I would imagine that you wouldn't take your 10-minute rest in the room where you feel a sense of dread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** Nope, that's where I do it because that's where I feel the most relaxed is with a sense of dread.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** You don't get any hit points back.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Fine, Rick steps back out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Yeah, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** He's got the massage thing on his neck.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** He's like, I just need 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** He's just sitting out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** He starts whispering affirmations to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Do you need 10 minutes, Rugg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Do you need anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** Are you feeling chipper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I'm feeling all rock.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** You're not a birdie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** You're not yet.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** You've never killed anything intentionally.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** You're a good person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** Everything that you've killed has not really been killed by you, but by circumstances.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** The gun killed him.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** That one's head exploded.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** It hit the ground too hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** Here's the one that supercharged it.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** That's what the thing says.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** Here's was the one that did it.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** He supercharged it.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** It's here's fault, really.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** After the 10 minute rest, I'm pretty good.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:51]** I'm only like three down from health and I'm full stamina.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** So I'm ready to fight whatever is down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Frog is also pretty good.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Sorry, Kelly.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Dope.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:56]** Okay.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:00]** Yeah, he's not at like full, but he's not that far from under full.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** He's also got a generous amount of hit points.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** So it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Here's looks down the ladder.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Takes a deep breath.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** Looks up at the other and says.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Perfect form.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** I don't know why that was funny.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** That was funny.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** Yes.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** That's so good.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Go down.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Well, now it's going to be really anticlimactic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** I climbed down the ladder slowly.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Very gingerly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** Cautiously.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:41]** Here's looks at the ladder, like holds on and says, looks back at everyone.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** He's like, shall we go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I will go first.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:52]** Because Rick has the jump jets, so he's willing to climb down halfway, and then he's going to pull out his artillery laser as he lands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Okay.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** I'm going to tell Frog, looks like we're headed in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** All right.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** All right.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Do we need to review radiation rules before we go in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Maybe we could have them up.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:12]** So put yourselves in the order that you want to go down.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:20]** It looks to be about... As you look down, you can see that at the base of the ladders are four purple...

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:29]** The purple doesn't reach up as much as the green does, but it seems like the spotlights are there at the bottom to help you be able to gauge the distance down.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** It looks like it's about 30 feet.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:37]** The ceiling ends about 10 feet down.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** So it's a 20-foot ceiling in this room.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:46]** And you can see at the bottom that there are grates underneath.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:55]** I can't quite make out what they are, but you can just barely see that there are heavy metal grates and there's infrastructure below it.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** It's like a catwalk.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** In a way, yeah.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:03]** Like the same material as a catwalk is the floor of this chamber down below.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Got it.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:08]** So arrange yourselves how you want to be because remember there are four ladders.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:15]** I think we will have to make a climb check because we talked about that last time when you guys came down the ladders before.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** I need to refresh myself and climb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** Well, there's only two ladders, technically, because the other two are damaged, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** They are damaged.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** You could probably do it.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** You would have a slightly higher DC.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** I'm not going to say by much.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** You'd probably just be up by two.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** Could Frog carry me?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Good question.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** King Kong style?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** Oh, we're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** He's wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** No, good.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** I don't know.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** I think so.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** It would just increase.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:49]** He's already going to have to make a bit of a tougher check to not just fall because he's a big dude and it's a smaller thing.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** And he's like, he's like kind of holding on to both.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** So that would probably just increase the DC of it, but it would be cool.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** I wouldn't do that.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Oh, but it would be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Yeah.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** I'll go in on after you.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** So what, so what order we're going down?

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Rick 19.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Then Hears.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Then Hears.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** Then Colin.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Then Frog.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Then Frog.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** Then Doctor, okay?

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Yeah.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Okay.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** Let me look at this climb check real quick.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Yeah, it's athletics.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Climb up.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Climb down.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** I think we did a DC 5.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:31]** I'm going to say it is probably a DC 7.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** to go down the ladders that are not there.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:44]** So it would just be the case that if for some reason you roll real low, then you're going to need to make, I believe, a strength check to hold on and not fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:53]** So Rick sees that one of the damaged ladders is only about 10 feet down, and he's going to take that one because his athletics beats is already at plus 8.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Okay.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** And he's got the jump jets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Okay.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** So put yourselves around the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:20]** uh around the hole where you want like based on which ladder you want to go down why can't we all just go down the same one that isn't terrible you you want to do that just good i want them it seems like the safest okay i mean i mean i mean i roll high enough to it doesn't really matter but i'm just saying like if anyone does roll low oh does bernice need to roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:46]** uh no because you're probably carrying uh so then yeah you probably need to you would probably just have a dc7 to go down to hold bernice at the same time but can you put bernice on your back i feel like you can't i don't i'm assuming she's a briefcase not a backpack okay all right so then yeah so then it's dc7 for you because you're because one of your tentacles is holding bernice and the ladder so it's dc7 for dr okay dc7 for rick and here's and colin uh go and make your rolls dr k what'd you get

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** 17.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Boom.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** 18 for Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** 18 for Colin.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** 18 for Hears.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** Frog also nailed it with a 25.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:02]** So he was able to very nimbly get down, even though it's a tight space.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** You might just have to wait a second, Dr. Okay.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** And let's get rolling.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:20]** What I'm going to do is tell you what you see, reveal the area, and then I'll tell you where to put your characters based on how you would have gotten off the ladder.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:29]** Because the four ladders emerge out of the shaft into the center of the room.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** That's what she said.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:39]** As you're going down, a sense of dread grows.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:44]** The alarm grows louder in your head, ears.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** You see it's an enormous octagonal space.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:58]** Again, there are four sets of bright purple lights, spotlights illuminating the ladder as you get down.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** And they almost pulse a little bit.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** The closer you get, they feel like they are pulsing.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:11]** There are four heavy columns spaced evenly around the room.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** You notice that on the eastern wall...

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:23]** There is a niche, and inside is a wire framework of gold and silver.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:27]** You've seen this before, anchored to a smoky crystal machine.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:32]** That machine is connected to a computer workstation.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:39]** There are two small humanoids crumpled there in pools of blood.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:45]** Small hemispherical nodules cover the walls.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:52]** And as I said before, the floor is this grid work of heavy metal grates.

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:06]** The west wall has a series of large glowing rods that run from the floor to the ceiling.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:15]** And as you step down into the room, rung by rung, you do start to feel this deep hum that's coming from the rods.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:21]** There's an airlock door in the center of that western wall between two of them.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** There are deep gouges against that wall.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:33]** But that alone is not the most important thing that you see.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:39]** If you scroll to the upper right on our map, you'll see the room that I've just revealed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:44]** So we're in the... The room is an octagonal room.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** Almost, what, four times the size of the room we just came from?

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Or the little octagonal room above it?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Yeah.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** And then it looks like there's the four pillars with purple lights shining inward.

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:02]** And there's... On the west wall is eight tubes running north and south.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** 40-foot octagonal room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:08]** And then to the east is... 120 square feet.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Or... No.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** 160s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Big math.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** You got to account for the corners too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Oh, right.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:34]** Let's try to... As you climb down, in front of the Western Wall, bathed in green light is the reason for these gouges.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** It is the reason for dismembered greys.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** It is the reason for frogs' fear.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:51]** It is the reason why you might not get off wherever you are.

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:04]** As you see this fearsome creature, a troll, putrid green with pink spots and growths all along its back.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** And then you look.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:09]** You see the gross on the shoulder, on the neck.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:15]** And its head turns and looks at you slowly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Doesn't it have two heads?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** You see long tusks protruding from its lower jaw.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:30]** And as it turns and brings its full body into view, you see the second head next to the first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** And it... Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:56]** just looks at you with anger as there's this like get out that like rumbles through the room and what could be the last time for some of you you need to roll for initiative initiative

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** This is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** I don't get a surprise round.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** I came down gun ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Okay.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:09]** So for the listeners, this thing is ugly.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:26]** I mean, we're talking like the worst version of an orc from a popular massively multiplayer online game with two heads and really, really bad acne all the way over his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** Just giant blisters all over.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Gross.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** They're oozing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Leprous.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Oozing.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:38]** But also like spikes coming from his arms and he's got like dinosaur feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Yeah.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:45]** Once you're 10 feet up on the ladder, you're eye level with this creature.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** This creature is large.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:54]** And I need you guys to go ahead and start by putting yourselves where you are starting within these four squares here.

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:02]** I'm going to put Hrog randomly at an area there, but along these four corners here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** I'm beginning to think I chose my ladder poorly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** Wait, so are you here, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:11]** Yeah, well, it's awkward because the ladder is in the middle of the two squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, I'm just saying that, you know, like, kind of where you, like, hop off, you know.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Rick is in the northeastern ladder.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Oh, now in the southwest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** No, he's able to jump jet over just five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** I feel like you went down the northeastern ladder.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** But it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Yeah, but I have jump jets on.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** I can move around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Get out of here.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** It's fine.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:34]** This is why surprise rounds against you, Kev, always are move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** An attack and a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:44]** Could someone move Frog in between myself and... I came in after Frog, so... Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:50]** I feel like Frog needs to actually pick his square before I pick my square, frankly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Yeah.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** I did one, two, three, four, and I got a four, which was the one that you were already in.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** So I feel like you're going to be right behind Frog.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:01]** So Frog is in the northeast ladder.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** Colin is in the northwest ladder.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** Rick is in the bottom southwest ladder.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Hears is on the southeast.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** and Bernice are behind Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:17]** So we're all bunched in nice and tight, and this thing has an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** One grenade to go off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:24]** He's just going to spew lava at us or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Acid bath or something.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** You know what we haven't even done yet?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:32]** I need to go around and see what initiatives did you all get.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** Let's start with...

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** Dr. OK, what'd you get for initiative?

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** I got a big old fat four.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** Oh, man, you guys need better than four if you're going to live.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** I have been prepping for this for a while.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** You're going to need some good rolls here.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Here's what you get.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** You just got a fat five.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** This is TPK time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Are we going to die based on some initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I don't know, man.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** I don't know, man.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** One hit on this thing.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** I don't know, dude.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Rick 19, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** I actually rolled a 20.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** 16 plus 6.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Dude.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** Well done.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Sorry.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** 16 plus 4 for a 20.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Okay.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** You live.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** I can do math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Rick lives.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Rick lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** God.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** All right.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Colin got a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:26]** Oh, showing up.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** He was ready.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** All right.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** What did Frog get?

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** Frog got a... Good question.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Five.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** It makes sense.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** We came down last.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** I was just going to say, the dice will always work out to tell the best narrative.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** That makes so much sense.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:50]** You're trying to get past Frog as you come down, and we're always making sure that you're okay, but then there's this...

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** That just like bellows through the room.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** All right.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** So round number one.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** Man, I am excited for this.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** Colin, it is your turn.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:13]** And I'm going to tell you right off the bat that you are going to need to make a...

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Where is it?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** I just had it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** If it's radiation, it's fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** A we'll save.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** We'll save.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:38]** We'll save as the dread of being in the room and then the bellowing of the troll, but mostly the dread from the room mechanically, let's just be clear, has caused you that you need to not take any negative effects from where you are at now.

**[00:50:39 - 00:51:05]** um so what kind of effect is the room having the alarm who is for those who are telepathic okay it's causing you to make a will save if you're not telepathic uh or or actually has mind link so actually colin you would you would start to hear the alarm as well because you have mind link so you would hear this and you would be like he has he actively has mind link with hears and that's giving him the

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** No, it just says a PC who has the mind link mystic feature.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** So because you have that, you are able to sense it.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:16]** And it is just like throwing you off your game right now because it's overwhelming your mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** So that's a three on the die.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Oh, God.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** For a grand total of 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:40]** wow that's a strong will save it's dc 10 so you were just able to shake it off and and like you are quick to action you're top of the round you're able to shake it off what are you gonna do in your combat colin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** Colin is not going to shy away from this.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:52]** You see the panic in his eyes from the initial reaction to the alarm, but his gaze steals.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:59]** He quickly casts a spell on himself called Reflecting Armor.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:08]** You see a force field start to shimmer about him as he takes a five-foot step toward Big Bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:11]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** He's a paladin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:18]** So was reflecting armor your... One, what does it do?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** And two, what part of your action?

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Was that a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** That was a standard action.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Okay.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Armor crackles around me.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:37]** Effectively, when I take damage, I can dispel the armor, which will deal the same to the person who did the damage.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Nice.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** Good old switcheroo.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** Nice Uno reverse card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Yeah, that is an Uno reverse card.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** I love that.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** That's awesome.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** And you take a step.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** What are you thinking?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** You're looking up at this creature.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:04]** I'm thinking, if I die today, it'll be looking in your eyes, you big, ugly cuss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** All right.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** All right.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Colin's turn.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** Rick19, you're also quick off the mark.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** You see Colin step up right as your boots hit the metal graded floor.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Let me know what you want to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:25]** I love that Colin was some kind of philanthropist worker.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** That's how he ended up here in the first place.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:31]** Now he's just like a battle mech.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Come on.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** Don't you know about Colin?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** All right.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:42]** So Rick landed with his artillery laser out and he's just going to first.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Did you climb down with it?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:51]** Well, it's I use my like a move action essentially to land because I went down the broken ladder.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:55]** And so I use my jump jets to land and that's a move action.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** So I can pull my artillery laser out as I do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:07]** As we know, some people here might occasionally make mistakes on the rules, so I just want to make sure that we're all above board here for some people who are repeat offenders like Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:11]** Yeah, I'm the one that uses move actions and attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** Just want to be clear about what you can and can't do with a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Yeah.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** So...

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:35]** now you got me distracted yep that's all my plan i want to first shoot i don't think i have anything that can test check it it's like this glow that's coming from these green things is that the radiation boundary i'm we're gonna hit radiation at some point like there's a door behind this troll i'm assuming that's the door to the reactor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** It would appear that way.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** You would think so, that that is the door to the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:45]** Is there a perception check going to tell me, like, giant radiation symbol on that door?

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:49]** A little placard that says, like, reactor control room 1?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:54]** Yeah, no, those glowing rods, that is the actual reactor core.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** What are you trying to get out of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Are these eight rods against the door?

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** There are these rods that are coming through.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:05]** I know you're a nuclear weapons expert, Kev, but for the sake of Starfinder... Not weapons.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** Sorry, a nuclear expert, Kev.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:11]** But in terms of rods, it does seem like... Reactor expert.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Reactor expert.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:20]** Those rods can emanate radiation, yes, but the reactor is beyond that door.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** It is a very heavy airlock door.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** What are you trying to figure out?

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:29]** Because there's also the computer terminal off to the right, the east of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Yeah.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** Well, Rick's just trying to think, like, what's going on in this situation.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** He's trying to clarify, you know, in his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:39]** Why don't you give me a... I'm trying to think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:43]** Maybe... I don't think there's anything really for me to do, to be honest.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Tell me what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** You're trying to figure out what the situation is down here.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** You're trying to take stock of the situation, right?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Yeah.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Okay.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** You're trained in engineering or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** I am.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Not very well.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** I'm changing everything just a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Okay.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** You can tell a couple things.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** I rolled a 16 for engineering.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Yes.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:10]** You can tell that the door, the large airlock door, blast door on the western wall leads to the actual reactor area.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:13]** This is a containment area.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:22]** The rods on the wall seem like they do have some sort of fluid going through them, and part of that green is from that fluid.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:36]** It seems like the devices, both the smoky crystal machine and the computer workstation, are what seem to control everything about the reactor from this control area right here.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:39]** It seems like they are interlinked.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:45]** And if you recall, the smoking machines are telepathic machines, and the computer workstation is an analog manual device.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:59]** So you think you're looking left past the troll, and then you're looking right at the machines, and you're thinking, those workstations control the reactor, and they're linked.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:03]** I might need to access both at the same time in order to do what I need to do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Both machines.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Not both rooms.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I'm saying both machines.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:13]** You might need to access both machines at the same time in order to take control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** One of us needs to stand next to this troll.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Or kill it.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** So Rick is going to say, I suggest you go to the computer terminal.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** And then he is going to roll over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:31]** I was going to say, Bernice can go to the one over where the troll may be covertly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:35]** Wait, there's no terminal near the troll.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** There are two terminals over.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:44]** There's nothing on the left western side of the wall except for the door, the troll, and the green rocks.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** On the right side is the computer station.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:52]** At that station is the computer manual input and the smoky crystal machine.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** You need somebody at each.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** Yes, you need somebody to access both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:59]** I thought you were saying one of them was the green radiation tubes.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** I'll stand by Rick telling here to go over there.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** And then Rick is going to basically tumble over this way.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Not actually tumbling, but just move this way.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** Straight down against the wall.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** And take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:34]** uh at this creature okay wait so you were gonna tumble i'm not actually tumbling he's not he's just moving but he wants to quickly move yeah okay let's see about it uh and i roll the shoot i'm gonna tell you right now that as you go to move out die did you at all you you just move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** I just move, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Okay.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:47]** As you move, the creature seems to super position itself like a little bit further and is able to actually hit you as you're moving out of that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** It's long range.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** It has a reach of 10 feet.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Wow.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Okay.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** You are within 10 feet of these two squares right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:08]** So you want to save my roll, my attack roll that I just rolled right now, or do you want to roll for... Do you want to take an attack from this two-headed troll, or do you want to move... Guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** Or do you want to move and not do it?

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** F*** me, man.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** God, f***.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** I would say if you want to step back, I'm not like, this is going to be tough enough.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** I'm not trying to screw you over.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** I'm trying to like, this is going to be tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:26]** If you want to move here and I'm committed, I ran against the wall, not knowing.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:31]** So I'll roll for, or no, you roll for attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Yep.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:37]** I'm going to roll because one of its claws rolled a 48 reaches out to hit you.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:42]** And that is, that is a 34 to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Are you f***ing kidding me?

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** I have a KAC of 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** 34?

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** God dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** Kev's going to be so mad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:59]** We're in it now, boys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Kev's like, I'm not even going to come back.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** I'm not even going to come back.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** And then it's going to be like 60 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** Yeah, I'm going to play by the rules and be like, oh, I didn't know any better.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** I'm going to move.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** And then you're like, oh, no, 48 to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:16]** Dude, I am not kidding you.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** What I tell you, we've got to play it smart.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** And as a DMPC with frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:25]** You shouldn't have to play it that smart to drop you into attack range.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** It's f***ing bulls***.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** Bulls***.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** That's bulls***.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** You can put this into the f***ing podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** Bulls***.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:35]** Kev, sometimes it's... You've been waiting to fight this creature for a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** Sometimes you spring the trap, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** Dude, sometimes it just... What's tough is tough, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Hey everyone, it's Kelly.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Thanks again for listening.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:49]** I want to use my outro to once again, welcome Vinny.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** Vinny is super cool and chill in real life.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:56]** And I think you can tell from listening that he's also a cool companion in the game.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** That's how he is in real life too.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** He's really awesome.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** So thanks again for coming Vinny and everyone is going to love you.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** I'm sure more and more, the more they listen to you.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:18]** And to you, the listener, if you happen to listen on Spotify, which is my personal platform of choice, if you go to the We'll Save account on there, you can see that at least on your mobile app under the follow button, there's a star rating.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:25]** If you could give us a star rating and let us know how you feel about the podcast, that would be super awesome and help us out a lot.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:28]** Thanks again and see you next We'll Save Wednesday.
