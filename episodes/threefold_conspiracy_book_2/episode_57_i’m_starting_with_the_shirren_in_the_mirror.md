**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:12]** Our heroes squared off against the screeching Skreelings, learning that these clucking creatures come with some impressive cluster buffs when they come together.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:21]** But the crew scored some impressive strikes on the one named Paul, who, like a McCartney, seems to be looking for the door.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:24]** Will our heroes soon see Mother Superior?

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:29]** Or are these harpies about to find out that happiness is a warm gun?

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:33]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:27]** I'm going to share something.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** It's not that embarrassing.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:38]** I don't know why there's so much gravity as to when I said I was going to share it.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:42]** When I was younger, I loved chocolate milk.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** Like, I really...

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** Really loved chocolate milk.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:52]** Any meal or chance that I could get, I would drink chocolate milk.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:09]** And my dad, being a musician, among other things, one time there was like a, you know, elementary school, they're like, parents come to work or to school day thing.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Comes in, he's like, I'm going to play a song.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:24]** And there's a old blues tune, standard blues format, that is called Malted Milk.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** You should look it up.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** It's a good song.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** And he changed it to chocolate milk.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** And he dedicated it to me.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** So all my friends knew that I love chocolate milk.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** And I'm in like fourth grade.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** And I was hella embarrassed.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** But it was also great because then later when I learned guitar, I learned how to play chocolate milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** And now I know how to play it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** It's a nice tune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** That's a good, wholesome story.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Yeah.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** That's cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** Yeah.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** That was sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I've got a fun story about chocolate milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** That was not what my question was going to be, but you know what?

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** I'm here for it.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** It's chocolate milk question today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Oh, I thought it's related.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Yeah.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** So I also love chocolate milk as a child.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** I mean, like among other things, but just chocolate in general.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:17]** And my family would take us to like hometown buffet where you could start with dessert and drink as much chocolate milk as you want it.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:39]** terrible part of this story is i would we'd get to hometown buffet and i would just drink tons of chocolate milk eat a bunch of ice cream and then throw up you just add the table and i never like learned i never like learned my lesson no i'd like try to make it to the bathroom and like squirt all over the place


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** It's okay.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** I've never been to hometown buffet.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Is that like golden crowd?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Cause we used to go to golden crowd.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Yeah.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Yeah.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** I think so.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** And like they had the omelet dude who would just make like the maker and omelet.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** I get like three omelets and I had the same thing.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:57]** I totally ate way too much omelet and I would be back and back and back again.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** And the dude would be like, you sure you want to know?

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** And I'd be like, dude, load me up.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** This is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** You're looking a little sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Your little fist just comes down on the thing.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** You're like, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Shut up and make me an omelet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** Shut up, Omelette Man.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Where's my omelette?

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Stop asking questions.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Less talking, more omelette-ing.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** Yeah, the worst part is, like, I never learned my lesson, and neither did my family, because they wouldn't stop me.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** That would happen every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** They probably did think it was hilarious.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** They probably did.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Yeah, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** Not our kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** I don't know who that is.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:32]** He didn't come in with us.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** What about anybody else?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Any love for food that led to an embarrassing situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Not really.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** No?

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** This question isn't good for me, but I enjoyed those stories, though.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Thank you.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:51]** Just for everyone at home, Will is very pensive in his frame right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:57]** I'm thinking hard, but... I'm just going to leave this a wait period to see if he says yes or no.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** He's sort of looking into the sky and thinking wistfully.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** What is he thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** I'm recalling something, but I can't see.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** It'll come to me later.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:19]** But somebody embarrassing like... You'd asked, I think, earlier a different sort of question before.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:25]** I don't have so many milk-related lactose issues.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:30]** But, I mean, I'm fond of fromage.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** But...

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:42]** I have like, I don't know, foods that I would go to as a kid or in young adulthood.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** I would ditch school to drink chocolate milk, go get a burrito.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** See, that sounds legit.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Study hall.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** It's not really like ditching.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Ditching study hall.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** Don't ditch classes that count.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Just ditch the ones where you have to study.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** All the school-age kids listening to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Yes.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** If you're in school or not school-age, you could be at any point.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Ditching is not cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:10]** They shouldn't really be listening to us, though, because we have that E next to our podcast.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** But we bleep everything out, so maybe we should take it off.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:16]** No, you bleep everything out, John.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** We didn't vote on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:38]** was never let's vote on it live on air kids have right now i think we did we did i vote yes i think that it's good because yeah we want to reach out to like young people to make sure that to give them advice like like don't like adult themes though don't ditch school

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:42]** Yeah, we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** Don't neglect your study of the liberal arts.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:51]** Just take it as a time as a human being to study and get to know the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Wait, you did study hall in college?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** No.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** That's not even a thing.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Yeah, when is study hall?

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:05]** College is just realizing that the liberal arts is like, you know, encompassing all, you know, like education.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** That's why you're supposed to be like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:35]** yeah yeah that's so your formative years spoken like a true doctor don't don't don't neglect your formative years we we have how about this we if you're young and you're in school we have questions for you because we grew up pretty much in the 90s and stuff so there we just ate we just aged ourselves but basically so um uh what we had show and tell growing up and then like nap time well they have powerful presentations

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** What do you have now?

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** Like, reach out to us on Twitter, the Will Save Twitter, and tell us, like, do you have show and tell?

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Also, are gushers still a thing?

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:49]** Like, I would just take, like, fruit by the foot and gushers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Fruit doesn't exist anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** Shove them all into, like, one ball and shove it in my face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Zebra gum.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Zebra gum.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Wait.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:01]** Wait, zebra-striped gum is... Will?

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Pre-teenagers.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Pre...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Yeah, they're show and tell.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** They're literally like PowerPoint presentations.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Here, let me give you this 3D projection of my favorite toy.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yeah.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** It's a computer.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** That's the projection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** Meanwhile, we have the overhead projector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Yeah.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** That you would turn on the fan super loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** With the transparent plastic.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Yeah.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:41]** Always cursing about cleaning it and how difficult it is and how laborsome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** The substitute teacher uses permanent marker on accident.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Screws everything up.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** Classic.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:56]** When it was a rainy day or you had a substitute teacher and they'd roll in the big old vacuum tube TV.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** The VCR.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Look up what a VCR is, kids.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Wow.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Also, we had chalkboards.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Look that up, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** There you go.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** Oh, man.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:15]** We're house hunting, my wife and I. You probably shouldn't, but we open up closets and just look at the closet space.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Everyone does that.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** Every once in a while, you see stuff in there.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** And somebody had VHS.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Well, it wasn't anything bad.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** And it's actually kind of cute.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** It was a VHS collection of home movies.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** And so we were reading the titles and stuff.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** But it's just...

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:36]** Man, we were like, if a young couple, like a 20-something-year-old couple was looking at this house, they'd be like, what the hell are these things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Or they might not, because they're people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** So, you know, let's not gatekeep.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** I mean, it's classic.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** It's a classic float in technology.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** When did DVDs come out?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** It's kind of cool, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Cassette tapes.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** That was...

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** That probably was an accurate response, John, where they are humans and probably do know.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:01]** Because it's not like an actual gap happened in real life like it did in Starfinder where people are like, what the fuck is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** It's not like top or anything.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** It's culture.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:16]** It's a running joke on the internet, but there was an actual time where somebody was like, how do you 3D print the save button talking about a floppy disk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:22]** Or how wild was it that you would call somebody, you would call their home,

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** And they like anyone could pick up.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:28]** It could be their grandma, their parent, their sibling.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** And then you're like, no, I'm hoping to talk to so-and-so.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** To Johnny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:36]** Lauren's great-grandparents, they have a house phone.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** Well, they're cordless phones, but it is a landline.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:46]** And when they picked it up, Grayson, his eyes got big, and he was like, what is that device?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** He knows what a cell phone is, because he sees us use it all the time.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:54]** But that thing has glowing buttons on it, and...

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** They're talking into it.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** Wow.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** What is this thing?

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Amazing.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** It's like a walking talk.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Yeah.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** And he's one and a half years old.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:05]** For him to have that reaction, just imagine what a 10-year-old would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** Yeah.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** What is that?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** Well, this is the episode where we definitely date ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Yep.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** And that's okay.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** I'd date me.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I'm a fun dude.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Come on.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Crickets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Is there crickets?


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** That was also a joke from the 90s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** DVDs came out in 1995.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** 1995.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:34]** What was the top hit of that year?

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** I don't know.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** Top hit on the top four?

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Yeah.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:43]** 1995 had to be like... I'm looking at it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** Your bit of useless information.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:48]** Top Cordio by Gangsta Paradise.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Yes!

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:51 - 00:12:00]** Or I should say Gangster's Paradise by Coolio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** Michael Jackson was at the top of the charts back then too, which makes sense.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** It was around the Free Willy time.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** I want a movie.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** That's cool.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** I'll be my lover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:15]** The last VHS movie released was A History of Violence.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Oh.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** Good movie.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Which I think is a terrible film.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** I liked it.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** What does that mean?

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Actually, I don't remember.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** I might be confusing with the difference.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** How is it the last VHS released?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:32]** It was the last movie to be produced on VHS before they stopped making VHSs and started doing just DVDs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Nobody makes VHS anymore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** No.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Just not a wide scale.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** You might be able to get private VHSs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** But on a wide scale, the distribution as part of VHS.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Home hobbyists.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Yeah.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** Please send us your VHS and equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** I would be surprised if they even did that.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Yeah.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** Now that we've spoken to literally one person.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:56]** There's one person who's a home hobbyist for VHS and listens to us.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** And it's like, you know what?

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Thank you for listening.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** This is my moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Thank you for being you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** I appreciate you.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** Can you convert our digital media to VHS?

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Yeah.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** That's what we really need.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Yeah.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Not the other way around.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** Everybody's doing VHS to digital.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** We want to go back to digital.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:35]** just ship weekly vhs you can buy the will save box set the will save box set whenever you hear a funny joke just press the rewind button just rewind and i love that like like yeah the it's not like they get thicker or anything it's all vhs they're all vhs yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** I think we used to have the VHS for The Lord of the Rings.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** It was a bunch of cassettes.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Good times.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Should we play?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** Now that we have all this awesome information that's useless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Do you guys want to Google anything else while we're at it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** I think we've hit our useless information quota.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** I think we've hit our threshold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Just aging ourselves.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** We couldn't do this when we were kids.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** You couldn't just Google things.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** That didn't exist.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Yeah.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** But role-playing did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** It did.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Great transition, Will.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** We could do this in person.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** That's why we're here today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** What did we do before the internet?

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Just stare into the abyss, right?

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Pretty much.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Wonder.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Look up encyclopedias.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** But now you can join us, listener.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Through the magic of technology.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Through the magic of technology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** So let's do a little recap.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** This is like...

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:33]** what somebody tells you before they put in the VHS tape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Cause there's no way.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** I just got to rewind one second recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:41]** It says like, Hey, before we put this on, you guys want to tell you something?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Listen up, listen up.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:47]** Under your breath, like, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** To your seats, everyone.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:50]** Class about to start.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Want to say something?

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Pencils down, please.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Eyes up.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Have you talked?

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Have I heard this before?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** I don't know.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** Have I said this before?

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:11]** Let's talk about how taken by surprise Rick19 was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:17]** And not getting hit by something and then got hit again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:28]** No, just that in this moment when you might have found the schematics, the keys to finally escaping.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:33]** When Bernice is interfacing with a computer.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** And I believe in that episode, Dr.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:43]** O.K., you were like, Bernice is going to look at the other control modules, which are behind some firewalls.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** Yet to be discovered what those are.

**[00:15:46 - 00:16:00]** And at that moment, these two winged creatures called Skreelings, like dangerous rat bats with fierce bites and claws.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** Surprise, Rick.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** And all of you.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** And then proceed to deal 15 points of damage to you.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Boom, boom, boom.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** As they flank you, their special ability to cluster and deal bleed damage to you.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** Which you still have, by the way, Kev.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Don't forget.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Yeah.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** He's bleeding.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:31]** Then struts in Dr. Okay, ready for this moment as you find out that these creatures have damage reductions.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:35]** And you think, I have just the concoction for that.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:44]** Successfully land a hit, wiping out the DR for one of the Skrillings, who we named Peter.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:54]** And starting a chain of damage as all of you then focused all of your fire on Peter.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Eventually...

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** skewering the wing of Peter to the ground.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** Peter's almost dead, trying to move and escape.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:12]** And it's at that time that Paul, the other Skreling, says, I'm out.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:21]** And begins to hoof it across the room, this room that you are sure is

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:41]** could be the launching point for the next stage of your escape so we're back in the combat paul the squealing is out which way did paul go paul a little confusing yeah i'm getting there paul

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:50]** is going to hoof it across the room, moving in front of Rick, incurring an AOL from Rick and from Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:54]** How is he hoofing it if he doesn't have hooves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Paul is winging it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Yes.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Soaring.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Soaring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Majestically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Flight of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:29]** fancy so much so that rick you have to roll the will save because you've never seen a creature so majestic do you are you serious do you want to take it down mid-flight get out of here do you want to destroy such a beautiful being yeah yeah i'm gonna do it every time it moves okay i'm just kidding you only get one no i'm pretty sure you oh well you only have one reaction so yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** It takes five feet.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** Moves five feet forward.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** It's going.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** Finally get to hit something.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Yes.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** What did you roll?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** What did you roll?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** I rolled an 18 on the dice with a plus five for 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** With what type of weapon?

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** It's an axe.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Oh, it's your axe.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Got it.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** Yeah, you hit.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** You hit.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:54]** You strike down in fury what nature has created to inspire others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:15]** probably gonna roll a one with my plus five and you're gonna be like oh it's got a dr5 it does have dr5 you're talking off your mic yeah i can't hear anything you're saying i know because i was i had my talking to my dice get out of that conversation it was private not bad d12 my d12 for it's a d12 plus five


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** Five plus five, so you take five points of damage.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:34]** And yeah, you do see as it... Just for the listeners, if you forgot from last week, these things have a DR of five from anything but cold iron, which we have not been exposed to at all in this game ever.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** I can feel Kev's piercing gaze right through his camera.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** I just feel like a rant is almost there.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Yeah, it's almost there.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** That's either my rant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Tell us how you really feel, Rick.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** You know how the implied rant.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Yes, please, Rick, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:57]** Kev, I feel like there are certain factions in the Starfinder universe who would not be happy that you're destroying such beauty of Paul the Screeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Ah, f*** these things.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** I'm with Rick on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** For all Rick knows, it's charging right at Bernice.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** So he is still defending his team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** Like a good teammate, Rick19 is there.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:16]** So Rick19, so Paul takes a hit, doesn't even phase Paul.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:24]** Slight course correction and keeps moving forward and is directly above Bernice.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** Bernice, you get an AOL on this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** Yeah, but she only has a ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Ah, so she does not get ranged.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** So there's no AOL.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Yeah.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:47]** As Paul hits the crack in the wall and scurries through vanishing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Is that a move action on its own?

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** Is that, did you do like a standard action to squeeze through the thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:57]** No, squeezing just like you take a penalty to your move and other things.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Okay.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** But it only moved, just wanted to move, move, move and get out.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:06]** And Peter is still in the room and it is Rick, your turn.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** There's a pinned squealing in the center of the room.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** Standing over it with his syringe stick.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** What do you do, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** It looks like these things are fleeing.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** What should we do with this one?

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:27]** Eddie takes a step forward and I'm going to hold an action to attack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** Ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** So if it goes to attack one of us, I'm going to swing at it.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Got it.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Got it.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Ready in action.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Do we know if these things are intelligent and can communicate?


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** Great question.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:53]** I would say that with your knowledge check, you would know that they do have an intelligence, but they can't really speak, but they can understand some things.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** Okay.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** Yeah.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** So it is.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Here's his turn.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** End of round two.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** Here's is going to... That's the end of the turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** Does my hold action doesn't count then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** I thought we talked about this.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** To take a ready action is a standard action.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:13]** So you took your standard action and you moved, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** Yeah, but that's until my next turn then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Okay.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** I thought it was until the end of the round.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** No, no, no.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Man, there's so many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** What is going to trigger it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** If it attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** If it doesn't attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** All right.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:30]** Here's has equipped already a hand axe, a tactical hand axe.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** So here's is going to step around the corner fully.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** You're prone.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** And here's is going to get up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** That's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** I've never been prone before.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** That's a move action?

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** Damn it.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** All right.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:45]** Here's is going to get up, and he's just going to try to peek his head around the corner as he's getting up and saying, like,

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** We don't want to hurt you.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** And he's just kind of like tripping over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:55]** And then he's like, but if you show us where the reactor is, we're not going to hurt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** Hey, flying rat, tell us where the reactor is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Just point your wing in the right direction.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** He could just fly us and lead us there.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** And we'll let you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** It limply moves its wings.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** It's definitely very close to death.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Don't know if it can fly you there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** It can just crawl horribly slowly there.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** It can only move 10 feet at a time.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** It puts its wings up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** All right, all right, I'll tell you.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** Don't kill me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:26]** Someone just pick it up and carry it on your shoulder, and it'll, like, kind of, like... Terrible idea.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** This thing almost killed me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** Animal handling.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Yeah, roll animal handling.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Top of round three.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I'm just genuinely curious.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** Like, is this intelligent enough to perform something like that or do something like that?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** To, like, lead you there?

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** All right.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Here's Nose This Now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Okay.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** That's it.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Okay.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Okay.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Thanks, guys.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** All right.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Moving on.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Top around three.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** I forget what I was looking up.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Top around three.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** Dr. OK, it's your turn.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** What do you want to do?

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:01]** You have this pinned squealing at your tentacle feet.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:27]** base of your body and it's does it is it like still attacking me uh it it's turn has not happened yet but it seems like it will probably be trying to leave as best it can as best it can based on the reactions of the other creature so if it can i like fight defensively or whatever yeah you can take the defensive what's it called

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** Yeah, it is a full action.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Or total defense.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** You can fight defensively.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Yeah, fight defensively is a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Or you can do total defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** Yeah, total defense is the one you're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Yeah, I'll do total defense.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** Okay.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** And then, yeah.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Okay.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** And if it tries to run off, then I'll just let it run off.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** Okay.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** You defend yourself as a standard action.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:56]** And then... I think that's all I can do.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:05]** Yeah, as you brace yourself, ready yourself, both you and Rick are standing over this creature, this poor Screeling.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** It does...

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:36]** start to move and step away you all have an alo on it if you want to attack all of us do like in any order uh well we probably go in initiative order for those but it's it's it's not moving aggressively it's just trying to get away from you oh i was gonna say can i do like a perception or a sense it seems like it's just trying to get away from you here's is ready to attack the out of this thing if it's if it comes into a sphere which it looks like it is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** Do you have a melee weapon?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Yes.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Okay.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** Is it ready?

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** That's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** Once it moves out of, it's right at the door threshold.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:51]** Once it moves out the door, you all will not be, Dr. O'Kate and Rick will not be able to make AOOs against the creature.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** So if you want to make one, it did just step five feet away.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Do you want to make an AOO?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** So you said it doesn't look aggressive.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** It doesn't.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Can I roll a sense motive on it?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** Is that a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:24]** yeah can you get a sense of if it's fleeing or if it's yeah i can just tell you it's it's fleeing it's trying to get help it's not it you don't know if it's trying to get help it just seems like it's trying to get away it's fleeing yeah okay yep perhaps it's knows its fate and is matched i am not a hired exterminator i just want to get out of here

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:38]** same so you let it move and if and if that if that reactor isn't shut down this thing's also going to die here's it's in front it's it's moving past you what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** Everyone became a pacifist all of a sudden.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:43]** So here's, it's just going to take out his tactical hand axe.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** And he doesn't melee attack much.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** He's trying to remember eye roll or it just has to make a check, right?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** You roll an attack roll.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Okay, cool.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** All right, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** If only Nico was here to stab it with his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:59]** Well, he totally misses, probably because he's still getting up.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** That's true.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** He just stumbles over his axe.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** Yeah, you were standing up and weren't expecting the creature to come out next to you.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Okay.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:13]** So, it is the top of...

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Let's see.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** It is Rick, your turn now.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** That was the creature's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:21]** So I didn't use my ready to action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** So I get to go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** I keep my initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:23]** Yeah.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** I think so.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** It just goes away.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** All right.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** So I will... It can only move 10 feet, so it's right in front of yours.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Moving slowly.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Dragging its wing that was skewered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** I will step into range.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** I'm going to walk like...

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:49]** Just kind of walk up to it calmly, because I have all the time in the world at this point, and I'm going to ready an action to attack it if it gets aggressive.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** Hears.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Or take my AOL as well.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Hears.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** What do you want to do?

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** It's your turn.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** It's my turn.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** All right, cool.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:00]** Hears attacks it with the axe and misses again.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** That's why Hears does not do melee attacks.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:04]** But there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Okay.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** I'm going to take the prone condition off of Bernice and Hears.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Thank you.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Yes.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Yes.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:15]** I do believe this thing is just trying to get away from us at this point, Hears.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** You could probably stop swinging at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** Hears just wildly swings his axe around.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** What's that?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Totally missing.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** I can't hear you.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** I'm afraid of bats.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Top around four.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:33]** Yeah, is this thing, like, still pursuing, like, an attack against me?

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** I'm just going to stay here and keep going.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Just trying to leave.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Yeah.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** If it comes through the door, I'll be like, here, let's get in here.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Shut the door behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:48]** I feel like Rick is, like, escorting it out like it was being bounced from a bar.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** He's just walking behind it with his axe.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Like, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:50 - 00:29:15]** you can't go home but you can't stay here yeah last call bro let's call kelly here's i was gonna say here's was like it's he still could move back in the room but uh rick's in the way so he can't so he'll just wait okay until the bat's gone okay until peter's gone peter moves 10 feet more away and incurs nao from here's and rick if you want to take another one

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:23]** Here he swings his axe wildly again and actually almost chops his foot off at this point.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** You rolled a one?

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** No, it wasn't a one.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Oh, my God.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Good fucking God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** All right.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** It shows no sign of aggression?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** It's just trying to get away.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Rick just lets it go.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Okay.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Here, do you let it go?

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Yes.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Dr. K, do you let it go?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Yeah.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** I'm in the room like 30 feet away.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** That's what I thought.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** I was just checking to make sure.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:47]** Okay, it goes away, and it seems to go back into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** There's a green flash from that room.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** There is no green flash.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** 15 giant monsters come out of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:05]** Can I, like, perceive the wall where Bernice relays, like, obviously, like, all this telemetry information from the fight to me on my data pad.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** Tells me that this other one escaped through this wall, so I go and investigate, and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:17]** It seems like a crack in the wall that probably happened during the onslaught on the bombardment on this place.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:26]** And it seems like they were able to get out and they are going back to that room just to escape.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** It's the closest escape that they can get to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Fair enough.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** Hears walks back in the room or just says, excuse me to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:39]** Rick steps out of the way and says like, you know, that thing was not trying to attack you.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** I know, I know.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** I just keep walking.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** I was going to try.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** Yeah, I totally meant all that.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** It did attack you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** I was missing on purpose.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** And me.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** You are correct, but we may have possibly startled them.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Again, I am not an exterminator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:03]** I think they knew they were about to meet their end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** Though we're probably going to lose XP for this, though.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Wait, really?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Is that a thing?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Wow.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** You only get XP for killing things.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** That's not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** You get XP for plenty of roleplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Thanks.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** It's like a real game.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Well, I guess that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Yeah.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** I never really thought about XP.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** It's like Starfinder is a real game made by a real company.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** I didn't mean this, people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** It's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** I don't know these hidden mechanics.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** The rules are made up, but the points don't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Yeah, that's what I thought.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Sort of with HP.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** But I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** I mean, there's the milestone versus XP.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** But anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** XP, that's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Cool.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** So what do you all want to do?

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** The room goes back to being empty.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:47]** There are more quakes, but they're minor.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** You don't need to roll a reflex save right now.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** Bernice, you were...

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** interfacing with the console when this happened, and Rick, you were investigating the room.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:05]** As a reminder, there's a large airlock door flashing that same red symbol that you see on the landing page, indicating that there's some sort of emergency on the north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Sorry, how many turns did that take?

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Three turns?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Four?

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** That's four points of bleed damage that I didn't take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** Yeah, you didn't take four points of bleed damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** And I am out of stamina at this point now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:24]** Do you want to do any, you need a DC 15 medicine check to stop bleeding or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:33]** I can apply, I can apply a minor booster to you and, uh, you're still suffering from bleed damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Yes.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** I have one point of bleed damage until I do the... I think you took two more.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** You can just do a medicine check.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Yeah.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** What?

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:48]** I think... No, you only get... You only took... I only took one... Because you only got bleed on the second time flanking, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Yeah.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** So then your turn came and went two more times.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** So you would have taken bleed two more times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** But I didn't get... I didn't get a dish... Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** You take bleed at the start of your turn, right?

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** So since then...

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** You took... That was round two.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Then round three came.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** I don't... Whatever.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Three to four turns.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** It doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:11]** I apply first aid and I roll... Sorry.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** You're fine.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** It's DC 15.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Stop bleeding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** Yeah, I was going to say, Rick's kind of like holding the wound where this thing bit him and says, can you help me, Dr.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** O.K.?

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:26]** Also, do you happen to have any healing serums?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** I could really use one.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Sure, see...

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** Or we have the Relax U, right?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** So Rick wants to take 10 minutes because his stamina is at 1 out of 32.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:40]** So he wants to take 10 minutes to gain that back and burn an 8 RP.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** And then the Relax U, is anybody else into their hit points?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** No.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Here's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Nope.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** So then let me borrow the Relax U, and I'll take 10 minutes.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Then we don't need to worry about healing.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** You just do the medicine check to stop the bleeding.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Okay.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Sounds good to me.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** Take some time.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** And I'll spend that time interfacing with these computers with Bernice.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** Okay.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** So do rest short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** So Rick is taking a short rest.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** and Bernice, you are going into the computers.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** Here's what are you doing?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Wait, how does the relax you work?

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:20]** The relax you works by you take, I think, 1D4 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:39]** during your short rest you can gain that yeah back yeah okay uh and then lastly sorry um i took accelerated recovery uh it says during an eight hour rest you get two times normal hp yeah it's not a you should have done that last time did four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Nice.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** There you go.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Kiers, what are you doing during this 10 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Kiers is near Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:49]** Bernice is just kind of leaning up against the wall to help them with computers if they need.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Okay.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** So he'll be on standby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Okay.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** So you're over near the wall.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Okay.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** All right.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:02]** So Dr. O'Kane, let's resolve what the computers was going on with that, right?

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Yes.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:08]** As a reminder, you had found three control modules you had hacked in.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** You had found one that was basic facilities.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** You could access that pretty immediately.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:21]** Now, that gave you the schematics for the two areas, for two of the areas here.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** I think I put them in your journal.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** As a reminder, I will bring them up on the up here.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:32]** There's this one.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** And it is a schematic.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Well, you guys can talk about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:38 - 00:36:02]** yeah we talked about it's it's it's basically the level that we are on right and it shows sort of diagram of hallways uh that look like i guess they're arranged like a like an eight missing the top well i guess like the top is where we are now in this room it's like yeah i don't know okay

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** It's like a figure eight.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** It's like a figure eight, yeah.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** But the top's not connected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:14]** The staircase or ladder or whatever seems to be right next to us, so here's tells everyone, like, you've all seen it, but we could probably go down this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:20]** Can we do some kind of, is that engineering or survival to know that the slash marks are ladders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:25]** Yeah, maybe give me a... Culture, right?

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** I'd say either culture or even engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** I'll do engineering.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** Here's today, 22 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** Rick, you're resting, right?

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** Oh, yeah, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Fine, I won't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Dr. K, did you roll?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:48]** Yeah, I rolled 28 culture, and I can roll for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** No, that's fine.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:59]** You know that slashes that start in the top left, move down to the bottom right, indicate a downward direction, typically.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** And then...

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:08]** Slashes that are going from the bottom left to the top right typically indicate an upward intent in movement.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** They're escalators.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Sure.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Yes.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** It's not a ladder.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** It's an escalator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** That'd be relaxing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Take a 10-minute rest on the escalator.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** On the escalator.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:46]** now dr k and bernice you also realized that there were two other control modules that were behind a firewall and again the firewall means that it is a i thought there were two maps that we had access to in the third month the other map came from the other area that we were yes this is the map here so yeah so there you did get two maps i just didn't i see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Schematic A is where we started.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:55]** We started off in the square block to the far right, came into the sanitation room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:59]** This was the, yeah, where we basically came out of the pods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** Yeah, there were two rooms at the top, two rooms down with little hallways in between.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Yep.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** I just didn't go over it, but thank you for that one.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** The other two modules behind a firewall.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Plus two to the DC to hack.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:18]** you've been in it for a while now, you know, it's a tier two computer, so pretty secure.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** So not crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:25]** So what we know is that this thing goes down from the map.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** It seems like it goes down.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Yeah.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:32]** And, and the one that's in the airlock goes up, hidden place goes up.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:33 - 00:39:01]** so yeah I guess the listeners wouldn't know that so there's a slash in the room off to the right of this room so there's a slash downward from top left to bottom right and then the next room up above us which connects to the other door on the other side of the hallway where that worm thing was that there's a that room leads to another slash but that slash goes from bottom left to top right which implies it's going upward

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Which that was the airlock, as we talked about earlier.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** Was that where the triangle was, the red triangle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:17]** Yeah, and it's the same, that same symbol is on the door to your north right here, because that door is the same door that was over in the area that's probably the gray kind of like resting area.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** That same door is in this room that you're in now, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:23]** Can we do another culture engineering tech to know what the red triangle means?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Did we try that already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** I think you already did.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** Yeah, you do know that it means that there is an emergency.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** They seem like they're airlock-grade doors.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** That doesn't necessarily mean that there's no air on the other side.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** It just means that they are sealed.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:40]** But they can be possibly opened, and maybe it is on this computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:44]** Wait, the red triangle means that they're sealed, or the red triangle means it's an emergency exit?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** No, that doesn't mean that it's an emergency exit.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:52]** It means that they are sealed and that there's like an emergency, but they're like sealed as part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** So the red triangle is like flashing.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** It's not like a permanent marking.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** It's like a light system or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:06]** With the control module that you're in right now that you can access that's not behind a firewall that gave you these schematics, you can also stabilize the lighting for this area.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** You can change the air temperature, air flow.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** You can do all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Dim the lights to set the mood.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** What do you want to do?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Is Kevin rested up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** I feel like you guys can do the hacking stuff in the time that I'm resting.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Do we still need to hack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:26]** Yeah, so what do we know about the modules, I guess?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** They seem like they're control modules.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** You are not sure yet what they control because they're on the firewall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** Here's what will help Dr. Okay and Bernice get into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** Yeah, so Bernice is going to assist Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** Here's also assists.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:53]** Use her, I think... Is this... I mean, because it interfaced with it before, so it could recall knowledge, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Or... Yeah, I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** I'm just assuming that it's all part of the same thing.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** So it's fine.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Okay.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:07]** So it can use its ability to, do I have to like gain root access to go past the firewall wall or what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:10]** No, a firewall means that it's only a plus two to the DC.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** It would be to hack in.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** It's just plus two.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** So what was the DC to hack?

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:19]** The DC to hack just to get into the computer, right?

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Was a DC 21.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** So to get past this firewall, it's a 23.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** Oh.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Yeah.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Okay.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** So it's not like root access.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** It's not nothing.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** It's not nothing, but, I mean, if you have people assisting, it could be possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:38]** So Bernice is going to, well, I'll just roll first and then.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:44]** 13 on the die plus 11, so 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** Plus 4 from 2 assists.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** 24.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** And here's assisted for plus two.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** So 26.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Yeah.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** So you are able to get past the firewall.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** It doesn't seem to trigger any traps.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** There's no like fake shell to the firewall.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:12]** You see that this first one is a firewall that can control the doors.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:42]** that are to the north in the room that you're at now and presumably the other door that's in the long hallway at where the grays would be resting so it looks like this is the control module to open or to close uh those doors and there's still one more module left there's one other module besides that uh yeah i'm gonna try and go for the other module okay go ahead that's a 26 that's yeah here's go ahead sir


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** I just assist.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** That's all.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:54]** That seems like it controls a small door somewhere below you.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:00]** And seems like there is a small door that you can access.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Maybe you look at the schematics.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** You're like, I don't know where that is.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** It seems like there might be some sort of a bypass tunnel somewhere.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:17]** that's connected to a shaft or to an area below you that if you wanted to go into, this would be the way that you can open that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Oh, man.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:24]** We have to open it from here, and then we'll get down there and realize we opened the door to the Rancor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Well, I could send Bernice ahead, couldn't I?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Downstairs?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Yeah, you could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:34]** I mean, I vote you open it, but that's just... Or I could leave Bernice behind and... Can I transfer access to Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:37]** You have to stay with Insider Hearing, according to the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** So you would have to probably go down, too.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:45]** I'll say that based on the way that the... Because when you guys first went into this computer...

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** It was like, hey, the reactor's gonna go off.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** You need to deal with that, right?

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** Or not.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** You can either exit out of the warning or you can be like, all right, I'll go deal with it.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:01]** And it does, on the schematics,

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:08]** It does seem like, based off of the reactor warning and everything else, this bypass door is not related to the reactor.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** You don't need to access this bypass door in order to get to the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Might just be something cool, though.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** You know?

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** You don't need to use this to get to the reactor.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** You can use it to get to the reactor, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Or you're saying... It doesn't seem like it connects to the reactor.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** It's not on the map, but it does seem like there's a control there.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:36]** Kevin has every urge to just explore the living crap out of this game.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:42]** I want to trace the lines and just walk every wall, open every door, search everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** But I could figure out where this room is.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** You probably can't just from looking at this now.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** There's no schematic.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** It's not appearing on any schematic.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:56]** It does seem like there is a door below you that's in some sort of bypass tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** It doesn't seem like that's necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Rick hears you guys talking about this.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** I'll just open it.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** It could open a way off of the ship, too.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Yeah.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Okay.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Should I open it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** I vote you don't open it.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** It's not worth the hassle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:13]** I vote you do.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** I'm going to open it.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** 2v1.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Okay.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Bernice's vote.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Well, we'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Does it count?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Bernice doesn't count.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** I'm sure she's going to vote yes, most likely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** So you open it.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Nothing happens.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** It confirms that it's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** We're all fucked.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:32]** Do we want to open this glowing red whore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:36]** No, we want to shut down the reactor before anything worse happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Agreed.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** That's probably going to open up some other combat or something.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** I'm guessing.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Maybe later.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:43 - 00:46:02]** okay so should we you guys can come back and explore all you want once we are free now that this firewall like that i've bypassed this firewall can i come back and like open this or like yeah you could i can't i couldn't remotely do that though right uh probably not you would need to come back to this computer station

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** Can I check out the other computer stations?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:10]** Are there more systems that they have access to, or is it all basically the same interface?

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** It's all basically the same interface.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** And sorry, you didn't open the door to the north, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:38]** no okay all right door to the north um rick wants to do a quick medicine check on the dead gray we never even checked like actually make sure it's true dead because we by the time we got in the room we got attacked but no he we do know that his head exploded we do know that his head exploded by the same way you do know that yeah but what what do you do i rolled a 21 for a medicine check you realize that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:43]** This creature also has a lot of small bite marks taken out of it.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** You think, oh, the Skrillings were probably eating it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** Yeah, Rick looks at his hand where he got bit.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** He's like, yeah, those look the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:56]** That's why I was asking if you guys were going to go and check.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Because if you did...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:18]** you would have gotten a bonus to noticing I didn't get close enough to the body the damn things attacked before we got there yeah I know but Bernice already went in and here's was like I'm not gonna go in so you guys didn't go in and so Rick said I'm gonna go look and you're like oh this doesn't count Rick attack Rick in particular by that time they already knew that you were there they were attacking right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** You can just take that to mean maybe you've got to look into things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:29]** Well, Piers is going to roll perception on this opening to see if he can sense anything in there so that we can move forward.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** And that is right here.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Are we ready to proceed down this ladder?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Piers is just checking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** The door, it's a closed small door.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** It doesn't seem to be open.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Okay.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** And there's no way to look through it.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** It seems like it's not trapped.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** It seems like you could just open it if you would like.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** I will.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** I do want Dr. Okay.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** And actually, I want all of you to make a perception check.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** What does that mean?

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Dr. Okay, you get a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** No.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Do I need to make another one or can I use my current one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** I'd say make another one because you were using this one to look at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Okay.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** I got a nine.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:14]** Nine from Rick.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** And I get how much plus?

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Plus two.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Thirty.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Thirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Wait, plus?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Ridiculous.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Why does he get a plus two?

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Why do we?

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Because Bernice.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** You'll find out.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Sears?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Seven.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** What?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** What is going on?

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Seven.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Okay.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Stop making up rules.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Bro.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** Just GM once and you'll know what I'm talking about.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** It's fine.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Killing me.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:42]** Dr. Okay, you are walking maybe over to the door in that direction and Bernice flashes you something.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** Something that is over here on the map.

**[00:48:47 - 00:49:00]** Maybe when Bernice went over there and tripped or was like fell prone, seems like there were some objects that were stashed back there, including seems like there were two small vials.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:06]** And then also there seemed to be something that seemed to be flashing, flickering.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** The light was moving off the vials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Oh, so it's not something attacking us.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** So, okay.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** I'm sorry for panicking.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** I thought you were going to be like, oh, this monster comes out of the sky.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** It's a spaghetti monster.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** It's like older brother with the giant flying wizard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Okay, so I go to investigate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Okay.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** You reach over.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:31]** You reach down and you see three things.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** You see two Mark I serums of healing.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** So now I think you have five.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** And you also see what appears to be

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:51]** like a little hollow projector, and it's just kind of struggling to cast.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Maybe something hit a button when it fell.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** I don't know.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** There's some junk or some rocks around it that seem to just have knocked it loose.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** It just seems like it's trying to form an image, but you can't tell what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** What did you find, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I don't know yet.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:11]** And he's like, I'm talking about those vials in your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Yeah, do you need a health serum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** I would like to hold on to at least one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** I tell someone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** How many do you have total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Four.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** I have five total.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Now you have one.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Can I have two of them then?

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** You don't need all four.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yeah, I can give you two.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Does yours have any?

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Here, take one.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** Thanks.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Shut up.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I love it.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** So do you guys each take one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** I take two and here's takes one.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** So now I have two, you have two and here's has one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Okay, so now I have two.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Yeah.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Oh, you have three still.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** No.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Because you have five.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:52]** You're right.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:52]** You're right.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** I gave you some.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Mac has maths right now.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** No, you're right.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** I had three on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** I know.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** I gained two.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Will is a professional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Maths with Doctor, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** Oh, there are magical items, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** You in the back, please.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Stop talking.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Eyes up.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Face forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Eyes up.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** I won't say it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:23]** I've never been told that in study hall.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** When you made it to study hall.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Yeah.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** When I remembered not to go get burritos.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Yeah.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** I love it.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Yes.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:37]** So I guess we're going to investigate this whole downward we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:37 - 00:52:00]** right did you pick up or do anything with the hollow projector that was there yeah i want to look at it but okay what can i do with it can i like turn on yeah you can just try and maybe hit it do just a quick little engineering check try and yeah make it work okay i'll say that you can like over the course of 10 minutes it's pretty low it's pretty easy to fix

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:06]** You just maybe hit it, maybe pop open the back, change the battery, connect a wire.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** You're taking 10 minutes on it?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Maybe not 10 minutes, but it's pretty easy to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** I was going to say, I got to relax you on it.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** I'll wait another 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** No problem.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:28]** So, Dr. O'K, you take the holoprojector, putz with it, and you're holding it, and it is casting out this little light.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:37]** And it seems to be... And as you connect the wires, the image forms.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:49]** And you see what appears to be an image that you instantly recognize.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:56]** Looks like it's a picture of a nature scene.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** But there's some sort of archaeological dig going on.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:05]** And you recognize somebody that looks kind of like Algiata Aeum.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** And standing beside them is a very young Dr. Benjam.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** What?

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Fascinating.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:19]** And as you're about to close it, you see that there's another image on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Wait, say that again.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** A young Dr. Benjam with the same age?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** With the same aged Algiata Aeum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** No, somebody that looks like Haljiah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:39]** Is this similar to the... Because we saw Dr. Benjamin and another Lashunta, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** She's a Rhyphorian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Rhyphorian?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Sorry.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** There was an image with him and a male Rhyphorian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Yes.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** So I don't think you guys saw that image.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** I think I told you about that image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** No, I thought it was in your room or something.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** Somebody saw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** Maybe this seems to be that same image.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Okay.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:05]** So it's not a different, uh, like a real image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Yeah.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Let me see if I can grab it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Good thing.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Let's see.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Boom.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** You should see it on your screen right now or in your journals.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Wow.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:22]** Team soon notices that there is a photo on the console, a hollow picture of a young Raiforian.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:27]** It shows an archaeological dig and someone in the background.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:32]** This was when we were hacking into something in Aljana's room.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Oh, so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:41]** Yeah, there's like some sort of face-like sculpture that is being uncovered.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:48]** Can I do like a culture check or like a history check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Well, describe the picture first.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:55]** So it shows a young man and two men, a younger man and looks like an older man.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:02]** Assuming the older one is Dr. Benjamin, the younger one is the male Rhyphorian.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:10]** And then in the ground, there is like a stone face laying across the ground, like 3D image of a stone face.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:14]** And there's, like, a little hollow ball scanning the face from left to right.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** A little light scan, yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** A drone of some sort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Dr. K, you want to do a culture check?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Yeah, like, recall knowledge.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Sure.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:29]** Like, is there some sort of, like, archaeological significance to this dig site that I might know?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** Give me a culture check.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Natural 20 for a 30.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Okay.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** It looks like it's Triaxis.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** So it seems to be some sort of Triaxian.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** Ruben?

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Not quite sure what the face is.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Just a generic statue.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** There are no certain markings.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** It doesn't seem like there's anything significant on the face.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** You can just know that it's definitely from Triaxis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:03]** And do I know anything about Triaxis?

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:08]** Based on my dealings with Dr. Benjamin in the simulation...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:14]** You would certainly know that... I'm trying to think of what there is to say about Triaxis.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:18]** You know a lot that Triaxis is the place where there are the Rhyphorians and Dragonkin.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** There's a lot of history on Triaxis.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** A lot of the culture now is separated between the areas where the Rhyphorians live and the areas where dragons live.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** And the Dragonkin, I think, live in both.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:33]** Obviously, check out MapleTable for more about Triaxis.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** If he has a video on that.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** Shout out to MapleTable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Shout out to MapleTable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:46]** From there, it doesn't seem like at the moment you know enough to know any sort of special remarks with the face that's in the ground.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:54]** But it is an interesting bit that something that you saw on the chimera is now not on the chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** So what we saw on this chimera was identical to this or we saw like a smaller picture of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:06]** You saw a framed picture of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:13]** Okay, because we didn't notice the face, or at least we didn't note the face in the ground in the other picture.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** Yeah, and I think we saw that in Algiada's room.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:23]** Because it was right next to... No, I thought there was a picture of her with Dr. Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:28]** No, it was somebody we assume is related to her, like her older brother, possibly her father.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Oh.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:35]** Because Dr. Benjamin looks younger in this picture than he was.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Yeah.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:39]** So it could be, yeah, again, it could be her father or her brother.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Okay.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** It's my assumptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Interesting.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:47]** It doesn't seem like the face is anything of any import per se.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Because again, there's not much to it.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** But the people in it, clearly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** And this is on a hollow emitter.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** Can we do like an engineering check on the emitter itself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:06]** Is there any kind of... Yeah, they're like markings or distinctions or instructions or... Made in China?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Nope.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** There's nothing on it.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Orion Industries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:18]** Is it like marketing material for this horrific scenario where we are lab experiments?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** It doesn't seem like it.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** But there is another image on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Greer 8.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** What's the other image?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** Great.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** That's a bad stretch.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** No, I'm sorry.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Those three images?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** Two images?

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** There's two.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Okay, what's the other image?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** You click through.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** The scene changes.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:44]** The tight, close-up image of a busy scene.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** It takes you a second to make it out.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:49]** I'm picturing the way that Star Wars has their holometers where you can see a little bit behind it, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:51 - 00:59:17]** a little transparent it seems like it's a small crowd of people they all seem to be happy excited arms frozen in midair outstretched celebration photo yeah but they're all reaching they're reaching towards a figure that is in the center maybe you can

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Try and rotate or look through.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:24]** It seems like it's surrounded by people.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:28]** You can only make out their face and their shoulders.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** They look like they're dressed in maybe very formal clothes.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** And one of their hands is up.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** The sleeve is rolled up.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:41]** It's a blue kind of collared modern business casual shirt.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** You can see the top of a gray vest.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** And that's when it hits you.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:53]** That as you look at the face, the face is exactly.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Here's his face.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** And that's our game.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Oh, hell no.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Come on, man.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:18]** Who had players seize a picture of themselves on the weekly We'll Save Wednesday bingo?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** Question is, does Hears remember this moment?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** Does he know what's going on?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Who would have taken the photo?

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:34]** Who would hoist Hears up so high in such a moment of triumph and celebration?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** You know what?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:44]** Just want to say we love that you support and raise We'll Save Up So High and being such wonderful supporters and listeners of the show.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:48]** Don't forget to like or rank or review wherever you listen.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:52]** And then when you're done, come hang out with us on the Discord.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** If you haven't done that, what are you waiting for?

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** What are you worried about?

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** You think Kev's going to go on a rant in front of you?

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:01]** Well, he might, but that's okay.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** Now I'm going past the end of the music here, but that's okay because I'm the one who edits the episodes.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** I'll close with this.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:18]** Hope we made your Wednesday or Thursday or whatever moment you chose to sit down and listen to us a little bit more fun, a little spooky, maybe a little mysterious.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Until next, we'll save Wednesday.
