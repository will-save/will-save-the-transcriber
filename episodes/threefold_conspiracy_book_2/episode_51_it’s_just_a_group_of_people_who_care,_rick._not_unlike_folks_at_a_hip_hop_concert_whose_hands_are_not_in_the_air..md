**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** We're getting tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** It's a possibility.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Some of us might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Maybe temporary tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:29]** Yeah, a little peeling stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** No, I'm serious.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** I will get a Will Save tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** I know you will.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:37]** There's no doubt in our minds that you would tattoo yourself anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** Anything anybody dared you to tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** That's not entirely true.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** You sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Yeah, let's move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** I wonder what his limits are.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** I feel like they're not very high.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** You should work on a new We'll Save logo that looks remarkable.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:58]** No matter where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** Imagery.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** No matter where it is on your body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** I don't know how that one goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:15]** Yeah, so we're one week away from a time where you could put on one episode of We'll Save for an entire year and you would loop back.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Pretty cool.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** Only possible because of our listeners.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Thank you.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** Yes.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** Thank you, listeners.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Thank you, awesome listeners.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** You guys rock.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** You guys are awesome.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** Yeah, you are fantastic.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** Didn't mean to cut off the high praise of you here at the table with us.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** I can see all of you.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** We see you.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** We can see all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** With our VR headsets.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Let's just do, like, we'll save Metaverse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** That's what we're going to do.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** We'll save Metaverse.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** Wait, the VR is just us in a room?

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** We can actually legit do that.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Bunch of microphones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** You can join us.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** I'm not kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** It's probably something we should talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** Yeah, we should consider it.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:03]** Will and I are actually in the... We'll save on location in the high desert.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** High desert.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** High desert of Yucca Valley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Or is it Yucca?

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Yucca.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Kelly, you want to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Nothing.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** I'm just in Long Beach.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** The port of Long Beach where all of your electronics come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:22]** All of my... All the furniture for this house is just stuck there.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** They're all waiting to come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** Kelly, why are you recording right now when you could be helping offload everything?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** Because he's a longshoreman.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** He's a longshoreman, yeah.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:42]** So, I just want to get to a topic that I know has been just burning a hole in my pocket, and I'm sure everyone has been asking.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** They've been like, oh, when are you going to talk about this?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** And, well, today's the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:52]** I always get really nervous when John preempts his questions in any way.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:05:13]** every time he's like i'm gonna ask a question about i'm like oh god what is the hella disgusting food that you liked as a child that you look back now on you're like why did i do that like like what is or maybe you still like it and and that's great you know what live your best life


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** I'll take lead on this one.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Cottage cheese.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** I know a lot of people like cottage cheese, but they usually mix it with fruits and stuff, which I'm still not for.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** But I understand that at least.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:29]** I used to just eat cottage cheese by the spoonfuls as is.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** And now I'm like, that is disgusting.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** What was wrong with me as a child?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Who didn't stop me and go like, kid, that's gross.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** If I see my son eating cottage cheese, I'm going to let him know.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** That's disgusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** You're a disgrace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** That's what you're going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** That is pretty gross.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** It's hard to top that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** You're definitely your mother's child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Will?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** I don't know that there's like...

**[00:05:53 - 00:06:20]** super weird food but uh i would eat uh peanut butter honey and marshmallow sandwiches as a kid that's not too bad that's not too bad no it's really good that's like a very sweet cream and peanut butter is really sweet peanut buttery you know like i always forget what the name of it's called but like there's a there's a navy term for it i don't know i wouldn't know the navy term yeah uh i don't know i like all kinds of weird foods

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** But, yeah.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** I think that's a good choice.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:32]** Yeah, that's a good choice that makes sense to continue, you know, to maybe just... Like, I'm not going to, like, go out and buy marshmallows tomorrow or anything, but... I found it.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** If it was around, I'd try it.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Can I have what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Fluffernutter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:36]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** Fluffer butter?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** A fluffernutter.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Fluffernutter.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Fluffernutter?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** Fluffernutter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Yeah, because the marshmallow is the fluffer part, and the nutter is the peanut butter.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** It's a fluffernutter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** The nutter is the honey part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** That...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:51]** Kelly, what food did you... That was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:56]** Honestly, everything that I ate as a kid was really delicious.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** The only thing... I sort of reversed the question in my mind.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:08]** And I think, like, if I was a kid and I look forward to today, I'm surprised that I would be drinking coffee, liking black licorice, things like that.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** But one thing that I might not like today is those Flintstone Push Pops.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Maybe today they'd be kind of gross, but I remember they were delicious back then.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** I like the orange creamsicle one.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Yeah, that's the best one.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Well, the cherry one was pretty good.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** They were all good.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** I forgot that those existed.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Yeah.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Plus the Flintstone vitamins.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Those were good, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:31]** Beer's still an interesting one to me because I still don't like hoppy beers.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** I'll drink IPAs, but I don't love them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** Oh, I don't like IPAs, either.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** Yeah, I've never acquired it, though.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** It has to be like the most mild IPA ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** The most mild one.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:50]** I'm going to put it out to our listeners and say that if there's an IPA that you think will change Kev's mind or Kelly's mind, I think you should let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** I've tried.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Please.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** I bring the hazies.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** I bring the New England style funk.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I do all kinds of stuff.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** And Kev is just like...

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Send me some stouts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Yeah.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Right?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** Stouts.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Stouts on a hot day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** Yeah.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** It's a hot day in June.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** Well, kind of the... I don't like stouts, that's for sure, either.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** It's too bitter.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** We're too strong.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** But hazy IPAs are pretty good.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** Will also has sours.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** He has all kinds of beers.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** But he introduced sours to me, and sours are...

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Oh, they're so good.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Sours are great.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** Yeah.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:27]** That's a frequent beer here at the Woolsafe table.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:28]** Yeah.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** We're members of many breweries, and we trade.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** We'll take trade.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Please, trade us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** There's the Kona.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Trade some good stuff.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:48]** Hanalei, yeah, is a really good IPA, but it's a tropical IPA, so the tropical flavors cut that hoppiness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** That's in now, though.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Yeah, it's in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** You can get that at Walmart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** The ballast point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Yeah.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** It's Kona.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Kona's a great brand.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** Kona had it like two days ago, the IPA.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** It was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** All right.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:04]** So before we start, I just want to say the thing that I had that if I had it now, I might like it or I might not.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** And I'm curious what you guys think.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** And I did it one of two ways.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:12]** Two foods, sliced American cheese, chocolate chip cookies.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Didn't matter how you make the sandwich.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** Two slices of cheese, cookie in the middle, two cookies, slice of cheese in the middle.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:27]** I don't know why I did it, but sometimes I would just come into the kitchen, be like, man, Joan's in for some food, and I just put them together, and it was tasty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** Individually wrapped cheese slices and cookies.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** That is so disgusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** I think you're ahead of your time, though.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:45]** So there was a show, there's The View, and then there was another show that was like, it wasn't a spinoff, but it was a parody called The Chew, where it was four chefs or whatever that...

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** It was a talk show, but it beats four or five chefs.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:56]** But one episode, I would put it on in the background, and one episode they talked about a grilled cheese chocolate chip cookie sandwich.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:02]** And I was like, this sounds... And even these professional chefs were like, no, you can't do that.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** And one guy was like, I don't know.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:08]** And they all tried it, and every one of them was like, this is so good.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:13]** Because the cheese is savory, and it's sweet, and blah, blah, blah.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** I can see where you're coming from with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Why don't we do that then?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** I might actually do it.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** Let's do it together sometime or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I just made cookie dough last night.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** Okay, make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** I'll try it, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Change up the cookies.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Change up the cheese.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Amazing.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** That sounds great.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** I want to go, too.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** I mean, it's commonplace now, but the maple bacon donut.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Voodoo donuts are good.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Jeremy, get us some voodoo donuts.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Yes, Jeremy, we're reaching out to you because we know.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** But maybe there are other listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:15]** up there in the north northwest does he like deliver them or something what does he do no he just lives up in the northwest oh okay it's voodoo voodoo donuts started up in portland it's spread out though there's one in like universal city now yeah it's not as good though from what i hear have you guys had it's just not the same have you guys had dutch bros coffee that's also from up north and creeping its way down it's pretty good yeah no

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** I don't know.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** It's not as good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** Sell us on it, Keller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:29]** Well, they're just like 20 jillion flavors, and it's really, really rich and creamy, which I like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** I think the biggest selling point for it is it's drive-thru.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** That's all it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** It's a booth.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** It's like a little kiosk-ish kind of thing.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** It's pretty good.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** Okay.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Yeah.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** But I like my lattes and they don't do very good lattes.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** That might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Wow.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Man, we got way off topic.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** We got way off topic.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** And you know what?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** I'm kind of okay with it.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Should we play?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Let's play.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Let's do it.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:57]** Wait, before we play, we got to do like a recap because I just want you to repeat what was said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** I got it.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Okay, gotcha.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** But when you say let's play, it's like all of us playing.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** But we're not all playing until you tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** Let's play is like the gateway.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Let's be real.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** It's the gateway drug into Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Go ahead, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** Thank you.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:24]** Don't use this long pause at all to build any suspense.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Yeah, definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** This is Steward Ops Special Agent Nala Yalamis.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:39]** Your operation has been identified as the source of illegal activity in Pac-World's space.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** Surrender and you will not be further harmed.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:47]** Please transmit compliance on this frequency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:58]** These could be the first words that you have heard in recent memory that have given you hope, possibly.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:05]** That someone, some person is out there and they have been trying to contact you.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:09]** This place, wherever you are, what is this place?

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Is it a space station?

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** Is it just a twisted laboratory area?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Is it all of this?

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** What are Gnarla's intentions?

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:23]** Perhaps they will have more answers.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:38]** Because right now you are in what is ostensibly a comms room, having defended yourself against the Abadar Corp gatekeeper robot that is associated with this security console.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:51]** You can see in the corner that there are rods that are meant to hold people, that are meant to keep people in place.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Why?

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** I don't know.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** They're called pillories.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:59]** But you're here, and as I move you guys over...

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:03]** You're on the landing page right now where I put the face that you see.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** And I'll read again what it is.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** I said move you guys over.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:10]** But I put the face that you see popping up into the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Well, wait.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** So this is like an elf.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I'm assuming woman.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** I say elf because her ears are pointed.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** No.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** But she kind of has the sides of her head shaved.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** And then like her hair on top is kind of pompadour-y style.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** It's not pompadour.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** What is that?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Just combed up.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Yeah, it's combed out.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** It looks like a faux lock, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** She has this tattoo.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:40]** The marking on her face, tattoo, maybe paint, it's under her right eye in gold, is the symbol of Waden.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** You can tell, too, a little bit that she's... Waden!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** So it's not the ship.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** That's the name of the god.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** What is this god again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:49 - 00:16:11]** waden oh uh could could we explain the gun for our listeners and for us in case we forget yeah of course you want to do a story time yeah a little a little new test that we're plugging that we're betaing called starfinder story time starfinder story time starfinder story time i'm gonna look over to kev the parent to see wait why am i the parent okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** I found Waden.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Do you want me to read the whole thing?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** You don't need to read the whole thing.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** I can't summarize it because I haven't read it yet.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:23]** Waden is the Endless Horizon is the nickname.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:29]** It is a chaotic good god of discovery, equality, exploration, and freedom.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** Its centers of worship are Absalon Station, the Diaspora, Adari, and Verses.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** The symbol is a starship heading into the unknown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** I like this phrase.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:53]** While Desna advocates travel for travel's sake, Weyden expounds the virtues of voyaging with an end goal in mind, even if the goal is simply discovery.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:54]** It's kind of cute.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** It's like Star Trek.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Yeah.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Yeah.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** It's like Star Trek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:08]** Envoys, explorers, Gnostics, socialists, and Starfinders, oh, and colonists heading to their new homes on recently discovered planets make up the majority of Weyden's followers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** I was going to say, it seems like something the Starfinders would like.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:12]** Yeah.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:16]** She also has the sigil on her collar.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** That is what sigil there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** That is the sigil of the stewards.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** Ah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** The stewards.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Kind of hard to see, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Stewards.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** Let me grab that right for you.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** Stewards Ops Special Agent.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Gnarla.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** Yalamis.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** So I ask what you all want to do.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:49]** And I'm going to tell you something here that you, I think, would know kind of for free, which is that this message is coming in again in Aklo, right?

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:53]** This is a comm station that is not necessarily telepathic, right?

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** Because you're hearing the Aklo words and you're translating them.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** But what do you all... Can we respond?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:06]** So I think you would know and you can see that you can respond.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:10]** These are messages that have come in, but there's a way for you to respond.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** Or you can wait and see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** I wish to respond.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:24]** Kev, can I just do a culture check on Aklo itself?

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** I do speak Aklo, so I don't know if I get any kind of bonus for knowing that or something.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:56]** you know yeah like what's its origin is that what you're trying to figure out who speaks aclo right we know the grays speak aclo but like i also speak where else does aclo use give me oh yeah i speak aclo now too yeah give me a culture check i'll assist i just barely assist but so i rolled a one you rolled for one and i have a plus two on culture


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** It is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the Pact World system.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:05]** So maybe you just kind of briefly forgot that, Rick19, right?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:10]** Maybe just in your mind, you're so focused on what is she saying?

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** Why is she saying it that you just kind of forget?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Because you haven't heard it often.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** Dr. Okay is like, yeah, pretty common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:22]** Rick just learned it 20 minutes or two days ago or whatever time frame that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:27]** It is the language used by the inhabitants of the planet Octurne in the Dominion of the Black.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** Octurne is a crazy place.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** You should definitely read the PacWorld's entry on Octurne.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** It is.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** There were some jokes about it a while back on Twitter.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** Octurne is not a vacation planet, that's for sure.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Kelly, what is the Dominion of the Black?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** What is the Dominion of Black?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Yeah, what's that?

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:51]** But while I'm clicking on it, I just remembered that they're like one of the organizations.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** I like this great word from the Starfinder wiki, or this great phrase.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:05]** It's an intergalactic coalition of obscenely powerful aberrations based in the dark tapestry, the darkness between the stars.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** Its ultimate goals remain a dreadful mystery.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:14]** whispered to be the extermination of sentient life throughout the universe or its replacement.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** by something from another reality.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** That's ominous.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Awesome.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** Yeah, that is.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:24]** And the cults of the Elder Mythos declared war upon each other.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:31]** The Dominion of the Black and the cults of the Elder Mythos on Octurne declared war upon each other.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** So again, Octurne's not like, you know, you're not going to go stay on a resort on Octurne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:42]** It's funny because Eox is a planet of undead, but Octurne is like a planet of just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:58]** evil it feels like well like there's a thought that is the planet itself part of the whole right like like the planet itself might have something to do with all of it it's pretty cool it's a pretty cool place so you do know with this culture check though since you speak at clow

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:05]** That you get the gist of the messages from words that are the same in common in ACLO.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:13]** Like it seems to â€“ like there's no idiom or special meaning that is in ACLO that is a particular reason why it's in ACLO.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** But yeah, so you're standing there.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yeah.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** You're standing there.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** I'm going to clear that for me.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:22]** Rick is in the corner of the room.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Bernice is in the room.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Chad, the door is closed.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** I believe he closed it.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** Is Chad chilling outside?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Here's.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** That's a good.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Yeah.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Just surfing in the hallways.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Just surfing in the hallways.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** And Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:40]** And here's are standing at this brightly colored Avidar core standard console and

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:45]** And you are hearing the sound that is occasionally coming through on the sirenscape.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:59]** You're still hearing that ping, but as you check the messages now, it seems like this ping has been because there are comms messages coming into this console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:00]** Here's.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:12]** Here's wants to figure out if we do respond, because this is a sort of telepathic communication thing, if any greys might be alerted to our response.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:18]** So it is not a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a standard Avidar core com console.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:23]** So it's not the gray telepathic one.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Got it.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** So it's, yeah, so it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** So it's like the gray stole Avidar core technology and made a whole room based on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** But there are these pings that are put throughout the ship whenever a message is received by it.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:38]** So they sort of modified it to like communicate with them that way.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Cause only I could only hear it.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:48]** Yeah, you were getting this ping, but now that you've been in the room, you know, Brick19 and Dr.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:55]** O.K., you can see that this is the flashing blue, red, and purple lights are coinciding with this ping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** You said there were two panels, though, right?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** And we only did something to the one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:07]** Yeah, so you saw that the console has two portions.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** One is the com, right?

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** It's the system-wide com, right?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:17]** The other is a camera monitoring portion of where you're at, but it's suffered catastrophic damage.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:26]** So there's no way to boot that up, see what was going on, but that probably would have controlled any cameras that were in this place.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Okay.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:38]** Doctor, I was going to say, I think we should try to contact the stewards and tell them what we've been experiencing.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** Perhaps they can give us some guidance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** I concur.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** The stewards are definitely a good organization to reach out to.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** They can help us and maybe save us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Agreed.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** Do you think...

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** Yeah, I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** Okay.

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:01]** Do I have to roll to operate this thing, or can I just freewheel it?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** You can freewheel it.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** Yeah.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** This is Dr. Okay, Dr. Contuocatus.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** We are being...

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:24]** We are prisoners seeking to escape this horrifying, illicit laboratory of experiments.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Please help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** You close the channel.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:52]** you've you've closed the comms right so nothing is is coming up on that blue screen yet you're supposed to say over over finish as soon as you say over no i'm just kidding there's nothing coming through on that blue hot like hollow projector you wait maybe 10 seconds nothing comes in 20 seconds

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:05]** 30 seconds later, the image, as it does on our landing page, coalesces into this same face.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** You see the symbol of Waden.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** You see the Starfinder logo on the neck.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:16]** And you see a look of, for a brief second, a surprise.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** And then the face composes.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** And that same voice comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Well...

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** My name is Steward Ops Special Agent Nali Yalamis.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** What are you doing at this station?

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:41]** I'm surprised to have received a response from Dr. Contuocatus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:48]** Yes, we were kidnapped and we were, uh, I don't know, shanghaied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** I'm sorry.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** That term evades me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** We were kidnapped under false pretenses.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:13]** We were expected to travel to Absalom Station, and we find ourselves in this maze of horror and demonic experimentation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:17]** Is there anyone else there with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** Yes.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Several of us.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Some have died.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:26]** And, well, we're in dire straits.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** We need exfiltration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:41]** You can understand my surprise and slight apprehension at... Well, as I'm sure you've heard the message that we sent through to whoever is here.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:55]** But I'm surprised to receive a response and I'm sorry to hear that you have apparently been kidnapped or that some of your crew has been killed.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** It's horrible, but...

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** I, again, I am a Stewards Ops special agent in charge here.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:05]** We are here to investigate this space that you're in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:12]** This might just be like a semantics question, but is she now speaking common or are we still talking in Aklo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** Well, Dr. O'Kay, I presume, came in in common, so she's responding to you in common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Okay.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Yeah.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** Because like, yeah, she was hailing in Aklo, you said, right?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:41]** As she finishes saying, reiterating who she is and a bit of why she's here, you don't need any sort of sense motive or perception to understand that she is actively adapting to a situation that she was not prepared for.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:48]** But as a professional, she is weary but warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:54]** Well, I think she said she made a comment about, like, we won't do any more damage or you won't be harmed any further.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:05]** So she is a part of this, like, you know, invading group that is bombarding the ship slash base or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Do we even know we're on a ship?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** We know we're on a ship.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Whatever we're on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** We don't?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Whatever we're on.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:14]** The reason it's falling apart and exploding is...

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:21]** The stewards, they were attacking this base slash ship slash planet slash star station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:27]** As I said, you are not the compliance that I was expecting on this frequency.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** But as it is, there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:42]** And as she's thinking of the next thing to say, then there is another of someone else coming into the communication.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** The greys are going to intercept.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:49]** You see this face that I'm going to show you on roll 20.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:56]** The face of a round... Sorry, the round face of a balding Damaya Lashunta man.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:08]** with military-cut black hair, slicked back where it might be long, trim black beard, appears also next to the face of Gnarly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Can I just get some clarification?

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:13]** Lashintas don't have male and female, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** I believe there's a Demaya Lashinta, and there's another, like...

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:47]** species of Lushinta but there is male there's male and there's female and I think there's an it's I think it's similar to Chiran and that there's like there's a host Chiran and there's another non-binary Lushinta but now I'm curious if you pull it up Kev that would be good well I'm trying to take notes too yeah this is a balding Damaya Lushinta man does the man say anything right so as soon as that face pops up he begins talking

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** Eulamus, we have a problem.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** Blast doors close behind us.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Station bulkhead quality.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** They cut off our retreat to the landing bay.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:03]** The computer here reads that the facility is on an emergency sanitation procedure.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** Two reactors, Eulamus.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** Two, both going critical within the next 12 hours or so.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:14]** There's an access tunnel that leads to both according to the schematics.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:24]** I'm already down one person and judging by what we've seen so far, I'd say it's iffy whether we get through this horror show to reach both reactors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** And then ask for clarification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Are those reactors on this laboratory?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** The man turns and presumably looks at what would be your face coming through on the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Interesting.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Identify yourself.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:44]** Shay, again, I am Narla Yalamis, the Steward's Ops Special Agent in charge.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** This is Shay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** He's my partner.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** He is on this station with you.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Really?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** So it is a station.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** We are unsure exactly what to call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:01]** Our, well... And then, for a second, she pauses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** We have our suspicions about what this is, but we're not sure.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:10]** I don't want to speculate at this point.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:15]** Shay and his team are supposed to find out the particulars during their mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:21]** Are you aware that this is a gray base and they are doing experiments on people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:26]** Shay cuts right in saying, Graze, yeah, we're dealing with Graze here.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:30]** There's something going on that is nefarious, and we're here to investigate it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** And you can see Gnarla is like, yeah.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:41]** You can tell that she's trying to be the responsible one who is both gauging who you are and not wanting to share too much information.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:46]** And he's just boots on the ground, figuring it out as he goes to accomplish the mission.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** We could try to convince them to reveal more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** And he asked me who I was?

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:54]** He did ask you who you were.

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:01]** This is Dr. Kuntu Okatus of Pabak and the University Planet.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:12]** My friends, we've banded together to fight these greys through their experimentation and demonic ends.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** We are looking to escape, but we...

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:23]** can possibly assist in your mission, should it be beneficial to us surviving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:29]** Shay jumps in and says, well, maybe we just got a break here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:35]** Listen, and starts to go into detail, and Gnarla says, Shay, one second.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** Dr. Okatis, could you please identify your companions?

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** I am Rick-19.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Rick-19.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:47]** I'm sorry, I cannot see who is talking, but hello, Rick19.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Is there anyone else there?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** I guess there's no one else there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:06]** My name is Hears, and I know you're going to look me up in a database, so you need to know that I have received pardons from your authorities.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** In case it's not there, you'll have to keep looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** He's got the paperwork checks out on our end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Gnarla.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Let me write that down.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** He's received pardons.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** Gnarla's face stays calm, but Shay smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:26]** Rick is going to jump in one more time and say, we had one more member.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** His name was Nico Orion, but we lost him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:34]** You can see Gnarla's face processes something and then goes back to Stoneface.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Shay jumps in at the pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:40]** Look, like I was saying, maybe we just caught a break here.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:50]** If you are who you say you are, and I think you are, based on your buddy here's here, but if your group...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:59]** We have two reactors, and if your group can reach one of them, my team can take the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Look, we shut them both down.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:10]** We can open these blast doors that are holding us in, locking us in, and maybe we'll all live through this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** after all.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:17]** And you can see Gnarla is trying to maybe jump in, but Shae's plan starts to make sense.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** You can see her stop trying to control the situation and be more approaching.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:27]** And she gives a pause to see if you say anything after Shae says that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** Our first official mission with this RPG.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Our quest giver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** If Nico was here, he'd ask how much they're going to pay us to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:44]** Look, is there something that you may need?

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Again, I do have your names.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Thank you for sending through your identities.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:55]** I think that you may be helpful to all of us surviving where we are now.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:59]** So I think it would be best if you are willing to help.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** It may be your only option as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:09]** Give us some direction and we will seek to try and both escape and survive this hellhole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** Shade jumps back in.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** Look, the scum here locked down their base.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** They set it to sanitize.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** The reactors are going to go boom in a few hours.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** I want to be out here before that happens.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:28]** Okay, the blast doors are cutting us off from our ship outside the void crier.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:34]** Okay, we got to shut down the main power in order to reboot and get those doors open.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:41]** And seeing as the reactors are already on an emergency sanitation procedure to win-win.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:46]** All right, so here one strong team goes to each reactor.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:56]** If the schematics are as I think they are on our side, assuming your sector is similar, you're going to look for a shaft going down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** That shaft should have a bypass tunnel.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** If need be, you can get to us.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:06]** But if you follow that shaft down, you will get to the reactor sector.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Are there any questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:14]** Would you happen to know where that shaft is located in relation to where we are currently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:20]** Can we establish a comm link with them intermittently, perhaps?

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** Are you on the same frequency, or... Gnarla jumps in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** Yes, if you would like to contact us on this frequency...

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:38]** Please transmit it to your comm units and we can work through or talk with you at any time that you might need, provided that there is nothing else interfering.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:43]** This is a dangerous place that both Shay, his team, and you are in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** We are aware of the dangers here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** So you're saying that our regular comm units that we use to talk to each other can now communicate with them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** Right, because this is the first comm unit that is not dependent on any sort of telepathic communication.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Dope.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** I don't know where your shaft is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:05]** Likely, if you're in some sort of a comm room, it's likely north or northeast of where you are.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** But it's hard to be sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:11]** Kevin rolls out the full map and...

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Is that you pinging?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** That's me.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:26]** So for the listener, we're down in the bottom left corner of this large map, and there's just a ping in the dark blackness to the northeast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:32]** Hey, if you guys took my advice and just read the AP, you would know where to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** I don't know why you don't do that.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** I tell you every year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Because then it wouldn't be fun.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Here's just going to say, like,

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:58]** uh so here's the thing we're probably gonna encounter some more enemies you should know i'm out of spells i'm completely tapped out we don't have enough time to rest so i'm not gonna be very helpful in combat most likely but i'll help however i can uh that's that you're telling shay i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** I mean, I tell you to this.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** I toss Kelly the elder card.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Toss.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Here's the elder card.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** I'm here.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Oh, that'll do.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Hey, thanks.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** I take it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** What are the limits on that?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Thanks, man.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Is that a once per day or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** No, there's five gems.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Yeah, there's spell gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** But you burn the gem completely when you use it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Yeah, unfortunately.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** No, there's like five uses per gem, I thought.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Two.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** Or four.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Oh, that could be, actually.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:33]** I thought it had like limited charge per gem, but I could be wrong.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** I thought I recall that, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** Narla jumps in as you all are trying to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:42]** If there's nothing else, then time is of the essence here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** Are you aware of an armory on this level?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** What's his name again?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** Shay.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** I haven't found one, but I've been more focused on trying to get to the reactor.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** If we do, I will let you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Sweet.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** It would help us in our...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:28]** quest to get out of here and shut down that reactor but armor upgrades would also be helpful oh that would be great i'll talk to the gm and see what i can do so rick turns out too and he says this sounds like we should get moving fast yes let's go i agree narla jumps back in there is one thing that my scans are indicating uh you should be aware there there could be radiation

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** And that could melt down from the reactors.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:39]** I have to say, too, I'm not quite sure where you are in this station, but it could be coming from several levels.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:43]** So keep your meters tuned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Oh, do I have a Geiger counter on me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Do we have to have a Geiger counter?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:53]** Don't we have basic protections from our environmental armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:56]** Radiation's a different thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:03]** So I'm pretty sure detecting radiation in Starfinder is explicitly you have to have a device that does that.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** So there might be something that does that.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** With that, Shay... What about my micro lab?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** That's a really good question.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Let me look on that.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** Shay turns back and says, look, contact me if you need anything.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:19]** He seems to be having like muted and then was talking to other people in the background.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Look, contact me if you need anything.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** We can get out of here together.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** This just might be the way to do it.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Let me know.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Over.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Goes off.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Gnarla looks and says nothing.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** I don't know if it's been a pleasure.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:43]** These aren't the circumstances that I would have liked to meet you, but again, if you need help, we are stewards, and we are here.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Good luck.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Cuts out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Cool.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** I got tingles.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:57]** It says that the microcord one has radiation protection against low levels, and then you can... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** But this might be higher than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Right.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** So the way radiation works is that they're, I think, low, medium, and high levels.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Your armor has protections against certain amounts.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:16]** Devices that detect radiation, I want to say that I looked up Dr. K to see whether your microcord...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:26]** Gains plus four circumstance bonus to engineering mysticism or physical science checks to identify an unknown drug, medicinal poison, or other chemical substance.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Yeah, it wouldn't be.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** I mean, a chemical substance, though, I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** No, don't try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:40]** I will probably defer a little in case Kev's going to have the, like, into the real world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** It says radiation is a poison effect, but I don't, it's not a poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** I see here.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** Yeah, so detecting radiation requires the right tool or magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Cast a spell, detect radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** I bet that's... I mean, there's probably a spell.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** Yeah, so there is a detect radiation spell.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Yep, there is.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:08]** And there's also a detect... Yeah, that's the spell.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:15]** Rick, give me a... Well, Rick and... Actually, yeah, Rick, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Damn it, man.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** Two different dice in a row, actually.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** A natural one, but my perception is a plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** So, seven.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Seven.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:33]** Dr. O'Kate, I would say give me an aid roll.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** If you successfully aid, then I think... What am I aiding in?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Just made it.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Alright, nice.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:49]** Rick, as you're walking away from these pillories that are in the northeast corner of the room...

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:56]** You realize that one of the hooks that would normally hold somebody, right, that are at the bottom, it's not a hook.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** You thought it was.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:12]** You look and you pick up this device that looks like maybe an airplane pillow, but it's made out of metal and cushion and has all these nice pastel lights that seem to just low power hum.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:17]** But you didn't quite pick it up because the pillory itself has like purple lights coming down.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:25]** And you realize this is a pretty new device called a relax you or a relax you.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:30]** Depends on whether you're a marketing rep or a somebody just buying it, right?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** An engineer.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** An engineer, yeah.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** It is a portable self-care device.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:46]** It has a padded collar that loosely covers the shoulders and lower neck, designed for busy professionals and distant explorers.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:57]** It monitors a range of biometric data, which it uses to provide automated massages, aromatherapy, soft-spoken encouragement, or guided meditation.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:08]** When using a Relax U while resting 10 minutes to recover stamina points, you also regain 1d4 hit points.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:27]** every 10 minutes you rest while using a relax you is treated as one hour of rest for the purpose of recovery and exhausted with fatigue condition that's amazing so it's you already have the only means of healing right now is as rest right now i think are you have some mark one couple med kits and i can do a first aid

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** You got Markman serums appealing, first aid.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:39]** Now you have this relax you where one of you can wear this next time you do a 10 minute rest and you can regain some hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Whose hit points?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** My hit points are about half right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** I'm less than half.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** I'm fine, so go for it.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** I could use it.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:59]** And also, I want to tell Bernice, I think I did this previously, but if I hadn't, I want to ditch the survival knife on the transmutation matrix.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** You don't have to ditch it.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Just let me finish my sentence.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Okay.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** I want to... Bernice is going to spend 10 minutes and switch it to the vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** Ah, okay.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Because she can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** It's not just semantics on it.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** It's not ditching because it's saved in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Right.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** I'm switching its function.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Okay.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Relax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Relax.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:29]** It's literally the word relax and then you... It's actually from the... It's from the... What's the most recent book?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** Not Galactic Magic when this comes out, but...

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Tech Revolution?

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Tech Revolution.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** It's from Tech Revolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** So it's not going to show up on our Hero Lab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** It should because I bought Tech Revolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Is it a magic item or just a regular item?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** That's a great question.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** Well, it would be a tech item because most of the stuff in Tech Revolution is tech.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** It's under gear though, right?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Not armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Yeah.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** No, no.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** It's not armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** There's like a pair of headphones with it too.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** I found tech gear finally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** So what do I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:08]** Hit 10-minute rest and then... As you're looking over that, all of your comms come through because I'm assuming that you've all aligned it to that frequency.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Yeah.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** Comms comes through.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Shade's voice comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:23]** Hey, just some more information that I thought you might need to know, which is just that there should be a lot of computer workstations wherever this drop shaft is.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:27]** Thought you might...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** Oh, God, is he okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Sorry, this voice is really hard.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** I really have a really... Yeah, sorry.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** That was me.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Okay, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:40]** Look, again, some sort of control room with lots of computer workstations.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** Let me know when you find this shaft.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Shut down that reactor.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** We'll meet in the landing bay.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Talk soon.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Over and out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:52]** We're going to take a 10-minute rest, guys.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:57]** Hey, do you mind if I try this thing out and get back to normal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Or sort of more normal?

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Didn't we already take a 10-minute rest?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Because my stamina is at full after that fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** Yeah, but I just want to try and get some hit points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** Does it work on 10 minutes or is that every hour?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:18]** No, it's every... It counts as an hour for exhausted or fatigued, but you use it when you do a 10-minute rest.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** And it gives you 1d4 hit points.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** That's the whole thing.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** It can turn your short rest into a way to regain hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:29]** So now I just can roll 1d4 and I can get hit points back.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Let's roll big!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** What should we do with Nico's body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Still laying in the hole.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** We talked about taxidermy several episodes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** We'll take a lock of his hair or something.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** We could clone him potentially.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Take a lock of his hair.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Why not?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Does he have dog tags or any personal items?

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:56]** Maybe we can give it to his family who haven't disowned him.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** His family hates him.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** His friends, I don't know.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** Maybe somebody cares about him.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** All right, here's is going to take a lock of hair off of Nico.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Nico's raven-haired head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:16]** All right, well, then Rick will punch open the door, and he's going to scan the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Here's, move your palm back to where you guys are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Oh, okay.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Yeah.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** I'm just going to rest in this room for 10 minutes, and I got two pay points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:44]** okay and uh before you leave the room uh personally yes yeah okay uh they could be the whole i think this is i think i'm just gonna sit here you guys go ahead uh um but don't get into any trouble without me because uh i just need to i'm gonna just try this thing out you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:44 - 00:49:13]** we will stay close Rick's just gonna stand like right outside the door with his gun up and just like just in case anything pops up cause those damn dinosaurs can still appear out of nowhere true there's one left I think at least yeah so Rick in here as you walk out Chad's hanging out there eating another burrito here as you turn and look down at the flickering lights that are flickering over Nico's body Rick you step right into the middle of the hall

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:20]** Dr. O'Keefe, you put on this relax you and you put on headphones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:51]** I picture it's just one of those like it's like a you like a flying like an airplane pillow but it's got like little massagers on there and that's enough to like heal your hip points and it's just like whispering encouraging words you're the best I feel so I feel great somebody's terrible mech-y grand project yeah

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** I see you there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** I see you there, crushing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** So as you step into the hall, Rick adheres.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** Rick, maybe you also are looking down.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:25]** at Nico's body and the flashing lights reveal again a tall ceiling you can see pipes and ducks running up above you and then something catches your eye Rick as the light to your left appears to be growing brighter and brighter

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:39]** Like, left down the hallway, or... Left down... I'm looking towards Nico, and I... Left down the hallway, and you turn and look, and here's... I don't know if you see this, but you do see something in between you and Nico's body.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:47]** Oh, mother... And it appears to be another set of green...

**[00:50:47 - 00:51:17]** as once again it seems that space and time are shifting and this green portal begins to open up and then this snout comes through and this creature that is slowly about the size of a wolf and it starts to step through one paw the portal at a time

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Just f*** off.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Wait, there's two of them?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** There's one on each side of us?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** There's one on each side of you.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:27]** And the mouth, the snout, the lips pull back, revealing these fangs.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Pfft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:36]** And the creature itself is almost dazzling.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:44]** As you can see that its fur seems to be made of some sort of shards of blue and white.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:48]** And the eyes seem to glisten.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:56]** And any light that hits it reflects and leaves all this weird reflection on the walls around it as it steps through.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** I know what this is.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:07]** And it's funny because as it comes through, it seems like the light was green from the portal, but the hind part of the creature is blue like this flash.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** And then it materializes into hind legs.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** And you all need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Get a picture?

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Get a picture for us?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** I don't even know how to react anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** What is Dr. Okay?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:26]** Is he, like, just in his... He's got his noise-canceling bows.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** God dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** He's just, like, banging his little head.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** I guess Bernice is kind of... Bernice would let you know.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** But Bernice is inside with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** Right.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:43]** This is why I was asking, are you guys going to go at the same time, or do you wait?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** That's why you were asking that.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Of course I'm going to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** We need to roll for perception every single time we exit a door, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I'm sorry, guys.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** They just appear out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** Wait, John, isn't this that thing that we fought in that one shot?

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** I don't think you guys have fought this before.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** I thought that I remember something like this, the way you describe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** I don't remember anything in the one shot that we played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Oh, that one shot a while back.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Yeah.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** Let me make sure.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** I think it's in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** That was like we were in a snow field or something.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I think the one with Sarah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** I thought that we fought something like this.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** It's all clean and beautiful and made of crystals.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I remember the setting more than anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:36]** So as it steps out, too, I just want to say one awesome detail that I forgot is that in its chest, you see that this flash of red, angry orange sometimes just...

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:42]** As it snarls and pulls its fearsome fangs out, it seems like its chest grows a little bit brighter.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:48]** And I'm going to show you here what it looks like on the map.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** We have fought this job.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** We have not.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** We have not.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Unless you played this adventure.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** You looking ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** No.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Alright, it's an adventure-specific wolf beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:03]** It was more like a gorilla, I think, in the one shot.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** I remember a glass-like gorilla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Alright, well maybe it's from the same planet where crystal creatures exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** So this thing looks like a jackal with really sharp razor fangs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** It's like a wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:22]** It's got a glowing orange chest piece in its throat, kind of.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** And the rest of it is just like crystallized

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** It is crystallized hair.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** It is a pretty cool creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** Rick's just going to start shooting at anything that glows green from this point on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:41]** Alright, let's go around, and I'm going to start with the person across from me.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Dr. K, what did you get on your initiative?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Oh, so I get to roll?

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Yeah.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Oh, well, that's right.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** I feel like Bernice is going to probably do it, but...

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** How do we want to do this?

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:57]** Because I was not thinking of you putting that on and be wearing noise-canceling headphones as this starts.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Make them roll a disadvantage.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** I think that's a really good rule, actually.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Okay.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Take the lower of the two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:30]** still better than mine though what'd you get uh hold on i'm looking at my initiative uh five five all right oh yeah yeah wow okay all right uh here's what you get all right um i got a five as well you got a five as well here's what is what is your dexterity bonus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** My dex bonus is zero.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** And Dr. K, what's your dex bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** I'm sorry?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** What's your dex bonus?

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** Plus one.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Okay.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** So Dr. K will go before here.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Wow.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** All right.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** And Rick19, what did you get?

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** God.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Because Rick's too busy.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** He's shouting out hears to get back as soon as he sees the first glow.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:00]** And then he turns to yell at Dr. Okay, and he sees the other glow.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:03]** And he's just like, as prepared as he is, he's still just in a panic.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:06]** And so he's just waving at Dr. Okay, trying to get his attention.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** And so, yeah, that's why he's a little slow.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** Wow, wow, wow.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** This couldn't have gone any better.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** All right.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:18]** So the creature that is looking and is closest to Rick.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** Oh, God.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** There's two of them.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:28]** The one that is in the north just takes a paw, steps it forward.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** There's this creature.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:42]** There's this light that seems to be running like down a conduit, down the creature's body.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:53]** It grows brighter and then brighter and then brighter until it just flares with this intense flash of light.

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:01]** And all creatures within 60 feet, except I think Dr. OK, need to give me a fortitude save.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:20]** because i'm in a different i think because you're in a different room and you're literally like you are in because you're wearing this like like your eyes are closed you're not trying to you know like be in the combat like i'm i'm did i get the benefits of my 10 minute

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** As a person, I want to say yes.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** But since they went out during the middle of it, I don't think you did yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I didn't finish my.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** You didn't finish.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** Okay.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** So I'm going to be down.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Do Bernice and Chad need to make fortitude rolls?

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Do they have a fortitude save?

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** What's the effect?

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** I don't know.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Yeah.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** I mean, there is a fortitude save.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:45]** But, I mean, Bernice is in the room with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:48]** Yeah, but Bernice, I think, was just more aware and was at the edge of the room.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** That was kind of my thought.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** I think Bernice is more aware.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** That was my thought.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** That was the contingent thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** It's all real for Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Is this an area attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** This is an area effect.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** This also might not apply to Bernice.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:09]** What happens if Bernice fails?

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** 16.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Bernice got a 16.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** What did Rick19 get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:17]** I rolled a 17 with a plus, I believe, 4.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** Dang, so 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Plus 5.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Dang.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Here's.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Oh, I got a 16.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Here's got a 16.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Okay.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Yeah.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** Okay.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** Chad gets no saving throws against attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Okay.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:34]** Is Chad... Are Chad or Bernice sightless?

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Because they both have sight.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** They both can see, right?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** If it takes damage... Maybe it just knows.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:47]** It says Chad takes... If Chad takes 600 more damage from an area... Yeah, then he... Area attacks.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** It gets no saving throws against it.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Okay.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** And he just dissipates.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Okay, correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:51 - 00:59:10]** Well, tell me if this would apply to Bernice and to Chad, but this will definitely apply to Hears and Rick19, that the Fortitude save was for this effect called Bristle Flash, which essentially allows the creature to do this huge flash of light.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** So because you succeeded, you are fine.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:18]** You would have been dazzled for 1D4 rounds, but you're not because you succeeded.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** So you're fine.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:24]** You're good to go for now.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** That's comforting.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Yeah.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:30]** But if you weren't, you would have been dazzled for 1D4 rounds, which would have been.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** That would have been sick.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** That would have been real bad.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:40]** And so what this creature is going to do is it's going to actually... It's actually going to take one step towards you, actually, Rick.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:46]** One cautious, calm step towards you.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:49]** And it is the creature near hears.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** It is its turn.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:59]** And it is going to... You see, as it snarls at you, hears, you see that...

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:04]** It is going to... The center of its chest begins to pulse.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:16]** Pulse just like the body until this focused ray of light seems to travel from the center of its chest.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:26]** You can watch it move up its throat and then out of its mouth as it shoots this light beam at you just like a laser pistol.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:30]** And I'm going to roll to see if I hit you.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:36]** That is a 25 against EAC.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** Yeah, it hits, obviously.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:46]** As this beam just arcs across and lightens up this whole space.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** And you take a bow.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** 68 points of damage.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** Six points of damage.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** You're right with the first number.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** There.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** As it hits you.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]** And then it also takes one damage.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:10]** This is some serious stuff.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** You covered your eyes successfully against this bristle flash.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Rick is going to tell Hughes...

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Get back in the room.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:27]** And he's going to just set his artillery laser down.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** On the floor?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Take a step.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** Well, he just drops it over his shoulder strap.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:32]** Okay.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Because it's how I'm playing this one.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** Yeah.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:42]** And he's going to just whip out his axe and take a step forward towards his dog.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:49]** And then I'm going to roll survival check and try to tame it.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:55]** Wait, is it possible to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** It's always worked out so well for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:07]** Do you want to try to... As a move action, you can use a survival to improve your attitude of an animal with intelligent score of one or two.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:12]** This functions just like diplomacy check to change a person's initial attitude.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:19]** So he takes his axe out and he kind of puts his hand out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Into android voice.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** Tries to calm it.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Would this waste my action though?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Is this my standard action is to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:33]** I feel like if you're actively trying to tame this creature, then yeah, it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** Can I ask, what is the intelligence score on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** I thought it was a move action.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:37]** It had to be.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]** But I guess you would double move, right?

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Well, you already took a step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:47]** You had the sheet that says whether or not it's an action or not, right?

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Somebody on Reddit had put together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Yeah, I lost that, actually.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** Dang it.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** As I changed some bookmarks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Yeah, I know.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:56]** It's up to the discretion of the GM, I think, is what the book says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** I'll say it's a move action.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** If you're trying to say something, it's fine.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** But you already took a move action by stepping towards it.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** And you switched weapons.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:06]** Well, the switching weapons is a part of the action.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** Yeah, that's right.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** Okay.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** So you could switch weapons as part of this move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** I'm going to swing my axe and hit it.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** I'll try to tame the other one.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** Okay.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** Let me just switch over to my axe real quick on Hero Lab.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Thank you, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:37]** So these creatures have moved from this green portal that you've seen before into the hallway and seem to be trying to isolate each of you and attack each of you using this massive flash of light.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:45]** And then by literally shooting a laser beam out of their mouth like a freaking laser wolf and hitting hears.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** And now, Rick...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:13]** What does that look like as you go ahead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:20]** I mean, he just like he steps forward and just takes his axe and does this wide swing kind of across towards its neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:25]** Towards where you know that it could shoot another laser at you.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:31]** Because that's what it just wants to do all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** It gets a reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** Every time it's hit, it gets to laser shoot you.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** It gets to just laser shoot you.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** Yeah.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:41]** As you swing up to hit, the axe comes across.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** And that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:44]** No!

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** We need like a sticker or something.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** We need a laser wolf sticker.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** Yeah.
