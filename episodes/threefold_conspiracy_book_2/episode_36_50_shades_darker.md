## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:12]** Last time, on We'll Save, Xtioomi, Xtioomi, Xtioomi, were the words that sounded in the mind of Nico Ryan, but what does it mean?

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:21]** The rest of the group struggled with their own mental manipulations before our mad grey scientist attacked our companions.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:29]** During the battle, the Grey didn't stop with his mental assault, making it clear that this Grey wasn't going down without a fight.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:31]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:37]** fell victim to a shocking turn of events as the Grey used a shocking mechanism in his glove.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:43]** Now our group attempts to make sense of this mad scientist's lair and the brains floating in the room.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** What will they find?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll See.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Somebody hit their mic.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** I did.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Do you want to do this again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Nah, it's cool.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** I like it.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** It's going to be a big transient when I go to clip it.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:52]** Hey, so I don't know who has watched the show 30 Rock.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:55]** I don't know if I can say that name on the podcast.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:59]** I don't know.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:18]** Kind of.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** Maybe I can find them.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** I don't know.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** I'm not sure.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** Do you all ever do that?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** Do you meet somebody and you're like, can I find them?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** Or just have weird thoughts that you're just like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** I don't know why I had that thought, but it's important to me.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** And I'm going to keep doing it.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** John, did you do the crusher handshake?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** Because some people do that where they just kind of crush you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Oh, no, that's so weird.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Like, hey, what's up?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** I hate the crusher.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** You have to do it scientifically.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:49]** You start off soft and slowly crank it up and see where that threshold is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** So then as soon as they realize what's happening, their hand is gone.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** It's gone.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** It's too late.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** It's gone.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Mangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Crushed to nothing.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** To dust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Crushed to nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** I did...

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:29]** i went through a phase where i was playing way too much grand theft auto we'll just leave that at that i had thoughts especially like like a great thought of like the way you could drive around and like just do stupid things and i'm like i mean i should just drive through this parking lot instead of like taking this or you know there is a name for that just like what if you just like pull into oncoming traffic what if you just like totally just you know knock down all the oreos off the shelf yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Things like that.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Like rage.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Cause rampant destruction.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Yeah.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** Throw yourself into the... Rampage.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Rampage.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I would definitely never do it, though.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Because then, like, my super ego is like, no, that's bad.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Stop that.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Stop that.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** You're so lawful good, Kev.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** I know.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Yeah.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It's impressive.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** But here's another thought with that same thing.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** Like, you know, like criminals, they don't have that same, like...

**[00:03:51 - 00:04:16]** preventative thought process when it comes especially like let's say somebody gets to do a car chase right i fun fact i have an addiction to watching car cop chases um but if you're watching a cop chase they will break all the rules right they're they're speeding they're swerving endangering people endangering people running red lights whatever the rules don't apply to these people anymore but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:44]** like subconsciously they'll always go back to a lane watch that it's just something that's ingrained into us like they don't they'll swerve all over the lanes but like they'll always settle in a lane instead of like just driving through the middle of the lanes like well you know well i mean you could also argue that the the road wears to a point where you want to settle in a lane anyway because then you're like hitting that i don't think that's what they're thinking well no you can like straddle the lines you'll be fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:52]** I'm envisioning you watching a car chase, and you're just kind of keeping track of where they're at.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:55]** Like, ump, should have got off on Wilshire.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** It depends on where you drive, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** That was rightly a mistake that they got off near USC.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:06]** They're going to hit that light and the cops are going to catch them at that light right near the Philly cheesesteak spot.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** Which is a good Philly cheesesteak spot if you're near USC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** The last one I watched, the guy turned on to a cul-de-sac.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Not smart.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Not smart.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Sorry.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Okay.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:25]** Not saying I'm ever going to get into a car chase, but if I got into a car chase, I would just take my phone and I would set it for like a destination that's way far out there.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:32]** That way it's always correcting me to get onto a lane that is going to take me away from dead ends and stuff.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** That makes sense.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** That is smart.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** If any criminals are listening to this podcast, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** Also, thank you for listening to Kevin Decker.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** That's Kevin Decker explaining...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:43 - 00:06:07]** how to kev remind me again what your address is uh it's in maryland on air so we so we can write yeah so all the fans can write into you yeah what my address is hold on i gotta look up john's how dare you it's not funny anymore you'll never find me it's fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Wait, what was your original question, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Could you repeat it?

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Do you guys have any intrusive or weird thoughts like that?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Nick?

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** John knows I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:26]** I don't know if I signed on for that intimate knowledge, but I guess I... No, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:31]** John, you and I have walked down to Ralph's years ago, down the street.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** This was back when I was kind of in a similar mode as Kevin.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:39]** I had done a little bit too much GTA, and I was having GTA thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** That's true.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** It's classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** I actually just robbed this liquor store.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:53]** After watching, like, Kill Bill or something, I thought, well, you know, if I could get a hand, a hold of, like, a sharp object, maybe I could take on, like, 50 people or something.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** I guess, like, movies do influence your perception.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Yeah, yeah, they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** When I watched Tenet...

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Have y'all seen tenant?

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** I haven't seen it yet.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:09]** I'm not going to say anything else, but I still feel like I can slip into the mindset of how the tenant world works.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** And it's so neat.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** It's so cool.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** It's a, it's a refreshing take on just watch it.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** And if you haven't seen it, listener, go watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:39]** it was great that's by uh that's the guy who did uh inception and stuff right same director yeah and interstellar yeah for no one yeah it's really good great acting very cool nice i'll check it out i hear check it out yeah i will i um i was thinking about your question and gta popped up again but i actually the great equalizer

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Yeah.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:49]** So I ride a motorcycle and I ride a motorcycle in California where you're allowed to like split lanes.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** True.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** True.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:57]** And so I've often thought like, you know, like GTA, you can like do that too.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:58]** With a car.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** Yeah, with a car, with all kinds of stuff.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:07]** So my, you know, especially when I'm driving.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Funny you mentioned it, Kev.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Oh, I love Grand Theft Auto.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Yeah.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** That's awesome.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:18]** I think about doing, like, riding, you know, driving my Prius the same way as I drive my motorcycle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** I would drive a tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** It's hard.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** In GTA, it's hard to ride it.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** You better... Yeah, it's dangerous riding a motorcycle in GTA for that reason.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** Like, you hit one thing and you're pretty fucked.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** But it's fun.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** And if you are trying to fly off...

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:47]** in in whatever gta game if you were transported into any of them and you wanted to like to do it it should be one or two because you have the top down view anything after that it's going to be it's hard to predict what's coming up so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:47 - 00:09:03]** i really like gta 1 was so amazing so cool yeah i was i was huge on gta 5 and gta online like that's what i really got into gta online is a classic it's addicting it's like skyrim it will never go away


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:27]** oh yeah that's uh uh what's the word i'm looking for there's an expression uh i was gonna say that's tall words but that's not correct tall words it's it's a it's a lot to live up to skyrim and the legendariness of it but i i kind of agree with you like uh everyone loves gta 5 so yeah well i mean speaking of skyrim they are re-releasing skyrim

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** They are.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** For the 20 billionth time.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** But not the next Elder Scrolls, apparently.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** Yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Yeah, that won't be released for a while.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Another five years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** I disagree on that.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** I mean, I guess it's to each his own on that, but I disagree.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:44]** I still think Skyrim holds the best of all time title.

**[00:09:44 - 00:10:02]** yeah over gta5 yeah for sure absolutely just because it's just it's got such like replayability yeah i've never like just i'm sure skyrim through all the way yeah i've only played somebody else's game like for like a few minutes at a time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I always just do side quests.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** I've never beaten the original.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** There's so many distractions.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I've actually never beaten it either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:16]** I've gotten pretty far, but I've never technically beat it and fought and took in.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** What's the name of the final boss, Nick?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** I think it's Alduin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:24]** It depends on which way you go, so you have a choice.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** But it could be Alduin.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:30]** But actually, there's a third option, dear listeners, where you can broker a piece between...

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:59]** the Empire and the Stormcloaks it's temporary now in that case yeah but for the rest of the game it never like resumes so then like in that case like you can but that is the that's a third official ending to the main story is that like you can you can not kill Alduin and not go against the blades basically so you get the best of both worlds you need to be everyone's friend sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too guys come on sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:03]** I remember for Fallout New Vegas, played the crap out of that game too.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** Oh, it's great.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** That's supposed to be amazing.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** But I saved it.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** As open and diverse as it can be, there's so many different paths you can take.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** There's only two major storylines, really.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:23]** And so I found that point where I could save the game and then make the decision to go to the dark side or make the decision to go the other way.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** I forget who the bad guys are in that one.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Oh man, my brain just shortened out.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:39]** There's the new California Republic and then there's the weird Centurion Roman Empire.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** I think they're just called the Empire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Caesar's Legion or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Legion?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Yeah.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Because they're in 4, too, I think.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Right?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:48]** Yeah.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** I played a lot of 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:54]** I've never really played Fallout, but I know New Vegas is incredible.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** I've seen, like, Let's Plays.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** It's amazing looking.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** Well, speaking of Let's Play, you guys want to play?

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Let's play some Starfinder.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Let's play.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Let's play.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Let's play.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:07]** Oh man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:24]** So let's just talk about last, last time and how much you all were lucky and did some awesome stuff and how much I was just, I was hoping for more spell action, but you guys moved in quickly.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:28]** So, you know, you all come into this room, you're dazed.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:35]** You have this conversation with this gray, where this gray is like, either you can submit peacefully to me using your brain for a projector for information or

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** or I can take it from you forcefully.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:45]** And you all didn't comply very quickly, and this creature had no patience and attacked.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:56]** And I just have to say, it had something called Deep Slumber, which I was very tempted to use, but it could have put you asleep for... Let me look.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:03]** That would have been... Two of you could have fallen asleep for at least...

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:31]** 40 minutes game time god the problem is that it is a round casting if the spell would have failed as soon as one of you hit and i knew that one of you were going to hit so i didn't use it so i was hoping to use other spells but then dr okay it's round casting it takes one full round it takes a full round so you cast at the start and the next time it's your turn it casts and because it's a spell yeah any hit especially from you here's would have totally just kaput the spell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Does it say like concentration one round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** Even with concentration, listener, if you know more about Deep Slumber, let me know.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Because if I would have used that, that would have been awesome.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** But it really seemed like it was not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** I'm not a spellcaster, so I haven't even looked into the rules of spellcasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** My understanding is that concentration in Starfinder is not really too much.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** If you get hit with a spell, the spell's gone.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** That's it.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** You can't really do anything.

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:01]** And you incur an attack of opportunity if you're anywhere near them with casting a spell.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** Yeah.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** So that was most of your rounds because you guys were right there.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:09]** But you all did some pretty badass moves and had some good tactics.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** But then you got hit by that console.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** You didn't roll well on the reflex saves.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** It was tough.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** You weren't expecting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:23]** I rolled terribly for most of that game, except for that final shot that always ends up being the kill shot because... Because you're a murder bot.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** No, because I do a lot of damage.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:30]** I'm very good at my job, which is... That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Which is what?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Killing?

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:53]** no uh doing damage yeah doing yeah which leads to death just like the last uh boss so congrats man another uh another notch in the old belt there another another belt none of the deaths none of the deaths on the on the chimeric count though because they're all they were all plants


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** Those are all fakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** I tried a combat maneuver that time.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** That was awesome.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** I failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:07]** You failed, but honestly, that's part of it, is that the dice work in mysterious ways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** I just pictured him grabbing by the shoulders and then picking up and moving them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:18]** And as soon as you picture that, I hoped that you would have gotten it, but then would have failed the 20% chance.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:24]** So as you grab them, you're like, and you lean forward and your hands go through the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:30]** And then he phases back and my hands are stuck in the middle of him.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** I can feel his heart as it beats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:54]** none of you stayed far away either because uh there was well i guess here's did but he didn't he didn't really have a line of sight what and then nico was just like sneaking around in the dark nico was sneaking around in the back but but see the thing is that the gray pulled out the gun which was a numbing thing right because he was going to subdue you and then as soon as you guys were like now we're going to take you out he's like all right i'm just going to kill y'all

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:01]** But one thing that would have been really cool was I wanted him to lean forward through the console to shoot you and then lean back.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** Cause he can phase in and then phase out, but none of you all came in.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** So I'm just going to knock you guys away.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Get away from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** I was actually really concerned that he was going to like push a button and then like a mech warrior was going to come out of the ground.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** That would have been super dope.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:23]** He was just like sitting in the, this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** No, but, I mean, to be fair, this was your first encounter with a gray.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** This was your first time really going up against him.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** Sorry, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** That was a doozy.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** I was almost at, like, full health, basically, to start, and now I'm, like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:41 - 00:17:11]** down to my bear bear three stamina yeah and i mean picture if you hadn't gotten that save against the whole person picture if you didn't get those shots off rick if you had missed those and you know and i got lucky you got lucky my first hit can it sure can it last i mean this is like what i said last time this is a dangerous place where you guys are at and i mean the troll paul up a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** I mean, I'm still pretty close.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** I got like 4 HP left plus like 18 stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:23]** Don't y'all... Well, the stamina helps, but don't y'all have some serums of healing?

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** I didn't use one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** You've got some.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** I don't know.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** I think some of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** I don't believe I have any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** I think you have a couple because you pulled from some, right?

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** One.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** I thought we pulled some, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** took all of them because they said.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Diorama.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** He's another mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** has them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:54]** And John mentioned, John, you mentioned that sleeping is not a good idea because this place is falling apart.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Falling apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** I mean, look, I don't want to say no.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:04]** I will say in general, I'm never going to have you guys be someplace where you can never do anything, right?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** You're always going to have something, one, just from a game perspective.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:20]** This isn't a crushing game, but there are times and there are books where it's going to be easy and you guys, easy in terms of health, and you guys can recoup and recuperate, and there are going to be times where it's not.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** And I think if you guys want to long rest, I came up with

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** a good solution for a way to do that?

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:29]** I was thinking 10 minute, but does a 10 minute rest do anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Yeah.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:37]** With one, when you burn one resolve point on the 10 minute rest, you can recover all your stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Oh, I'll do that.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** So, well, we could just do a long rest too, is what John's saying.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** We might want to save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:47]** Long rest you get, you recover one HP per character level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** I don't need that.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Yeah.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** Oh, you can't do it for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** I only need it for my biohacks.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** I just need to regain stamina points.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:03]** In Starfinder, you can gain back stamina pretty easily, but there's no real way to recuperate health.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:08]** You have to use healing potions or serums or spells to get your health back up.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Which kind of makes sense.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:25]** If you look at stamina as your endurance and your fatigue level, and your actual HP is your physical health, that if you were shot and stabbed to the point where your armor broke loose and you're all out of breath...

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** If you actually took bodily damage, it takes more than just sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** That makes a lot of sense.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** It does make a lot of sense.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** I think that's a good explanation.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** And I think we should rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** Okay.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** Well, let's move you guys to the map over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:52]** Right before you do that, I was looking at this title screen that you have, which there's now six red dots.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Those were there from the last episode.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** I'm assuming those are supposed to represent the information.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Yeah, the six holographic cylinders.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:06]** But there's also a little green speck above the T and there's a green speck on it.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** That's not intentional.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** I don't think.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** It's probably a glitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Are y'all on the screen?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** A real glitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** I don't see any different other than.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** What's there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** I mean, like I can zoom out and zoom back in and it stays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:25]** Are you on the landing screen or on the screen with the landing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** The landing screen.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Yeah.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Oh, well, ignore it.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:33]** So these information brains are significant enough that he put them on the landing page.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** Let's keep that in mind when we go into this level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** Well, these projector things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, the brains.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** We've got to pull them down and protect them.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Save them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** I don't think that... Yeah.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** I don't think the ten minutes will recharge spell slots, though.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I'm trying to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:54]** If a brain is already separated from a body, I'm going to go ahead and say that's firmly within the realm of a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** Oh my god.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:03]** Nick comes in with the one-liner pinning himself, accusing himself.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:10]** You all can think about, you know, yeah, these brains, maybe we want to use them.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:18]** Also consider that, you know, the creature he said that these brains were a way to repurpose and use data.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Rewind a little bit.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Why are brains considered liabilities?

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** They can't attack you.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** They can't hurt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:33]** Yeah, but you're also carrying around a brain with you with no specific purpose or function.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:36]** It's just kind of like, do you really want to be carrying a brain around?

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** What is it going to do for you?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** It's already dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** There is much to be studied, young man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:50]** And I don't know what your definition of dead is, but if the brain still has functions, then it's alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Alive.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Then it is alive.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** What is life?

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** I think life is the ability to choose for yourself.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** You don't think these brains could choose?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Let's ask them.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** We got to plug them into something to let them...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:21]** We're going to have, we should totally have this debate on the actual game where we just go up to one of the brain beams and we just like, so we have an ongoing debate going on between myself and number 19 here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:28]** And the brains are going to be like, just kill me, kill me.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:37]** Because, again, as this creature, as you killed it, Rick, it fell back.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:43]** The back of its head explodes from, again, something buried deep inside.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Explodes.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** The console goes dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:50]** As Rick knocked it unconscious, the back of its head exploded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Naturally.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Of course.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** No, you killed it.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** Killed it.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** It was brought to zero HP.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Yeah.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:07]** Here says like, I think we should gather intel, but I'm kind of like a little worn out if anyone wants to rest.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:14]** You know, I think it's probably wise and prudent given that we're dealing with a pretty powerful alien race we've never encountered before.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** It was obviously a tough battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** Well, I'm gonna take ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** Just to... I need a bit longer.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** I gotta say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:30]** I do have to point out that those rumbling and explosions are continuing to happen at increasing intervals.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** I'm not sure this place is stable enough for us to take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Someone should take watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** Someone should just take first watch.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** I volunteer to take watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** all right, I got to sleep first then.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Thanks guys.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** It'll help us out.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** So y'all are taking a long rest.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** I am taking a long rest.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** And here's some of us are.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** Yeah.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:03]** Well, if one person is taking a long rest, then for all intents and purposes, you guys are like, you are all waiting around for eight hours, right?

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** But I mean, isn't the definition of a long rest.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** You have to be resting.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** Like being on watch isn't restful.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:20]** Correct, but the people who are resting, part of what I'm thinking is that this place is... It's about to just die, and we have eight hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** We can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Well, you don't know.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** It could be in the next few hours.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** It could be in the next 24 or 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:38]** That's what we're saying is Rick's not going to take a rest, so if something starts to happen enough that he thinks the place is crumbling on us, he will wake them up, and they'll just not get their full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:50]** I actually think that because it's rumbling, what I was going to do is that you can rest your full eight hours, but either you're probably going to have a D4 of which you don't restore something, right?

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Because it's rumbling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** What if rumbling rocks them to sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:57]** A gentle cradle from wherever you are.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Cradles you to sleep.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Yeah.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** It's like a little massage chair or something.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:05]** No, I mean, so you all are... You would restore your stamina.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** You would restore your HP, right?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Which is one per level, right?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** As you rest.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** So you would all get three HP back, right?

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** And then you would get spells back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:14]** Yeah.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** That's the idea for sure.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Yeah.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** And then, Nico, you would get what back?

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Health.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Health.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Okay.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** I mean, I think...

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** This feels like the best way to do it for me.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** I'm going to roll something just to see, but let me just do that.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Let me just do a quick roll.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** So you all want to stay in this room for eight hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** I mean, I'd like to roll to see... I'd like to not be in this room.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:52]** Like, as an engineer and a computer, I don't know, like, expert as he is, he'd like to maybe see the state of the structure, like, see how risky it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:57]** Actually, I agree with Will.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** We should not sleep in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:07]** I think before we even talk about sleeping, maybe you should check this computer because this guy wasn't concerned about the room collapsing.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** No, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** And I will check first.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:15]** I just wanted to, before we got carried away, just say, hey, we should probably take you to YouTube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** So let's take a 10-minute rest for now.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** All right.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** I mean, we don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:27]** I don't want to use my resolve points if that's, I don't want to use a resolve point for that, to be honest.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** Okay.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** Personally.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** So if you guys want to like do a 10 minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:34]** Well, so let's talk about, so you're going to take a 10 minute rest right now.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** Or some of you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** I was going to check.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:41]** I didn't want to necessarily do it in this room.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** I wanted to check this room and then go.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Sure.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Okay.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:51]** So you guys are going to check the room, and then you'll figure out the rest situation, which is super compelling, and we'll keep all of it, and it'll be most of the episode.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** It's talking about rest.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** All right.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Indeed.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Yeah.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Yeah, indeed.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:59]** I was going to tell you guys what you get because you guys are looking around, right?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** You're trying to see what's going on?

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Okay.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** The creature, the gray, back of the head exploded.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:12]** Consoles must have been connected to that because the consoles are down.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Consoles cannot be accessed.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:27]** You do find as you're going around, you do see that in the podium, there is a compartment that is... You kind of depress your hand and it comes out from one of the consoles.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** It just mechanically comes out.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** There you find 500 UPBs.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** You find a hacking kit.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:42]** And you find an engineering toolkit for building maintenance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Nico's going to take the hacking kit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Okay.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Do you all search the gray?

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Yes.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** Here's one to search this gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** You find.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** I don't know.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** UPBs.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** That's like the stuff that you make things from, like that we found in the other starship upgrades.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Universal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** They're equal to like one credit.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:13]** So you could either buy things with credits or you could trade these little, I think it's like one by one by one cubes that essentially are the basic building blocks for so many things that they are a functional part of the economy.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** Universal polymer base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** Well, I'll take this toolkit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:21]** It takes a quarter of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Two quarters of the 500?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** No, one quarter.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:31]** He takes one quarter of those, and then he'll take the engineering thing that you mentioned.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Okay, the engineering thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:35]** I want it, but I don't need it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** But you're... Okay.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Well, let me know if you want it later.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** We can talk about it or something.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** I have it for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:48]** On the gray, the suit, the faded green with the gold rings, right?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Yeah.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** It functions as basic Lushunta temp weave.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** It's called a gray skin suit.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** But it functions as Lushunta temp weave.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:02]** Note that grays are small, so it's technically for a small creature.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** Also, the gun is an advanced numbing beam.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** Two batteries, 20 charges each.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** None were fired.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:18]** That thing is a... The thing that hit Dr. OK, the glove with the glow, is a static shock pad.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** One battery.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:25]** And that was used... It has some charges depleted because it was used against Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:31]** Is the numbing beam, is that a small arms or is that a rifle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Good question.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Don't know.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Let me look.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Had it up here.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** It is a...

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Armory, 35.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** It deals non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** It's a two-headed longarm.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Longarm.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** Okay.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** 1d8 damage.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** 50 foot of range.

**[00:29:54 - 00:30:00]** And last thing, as you guys are going through the skin suit, you feel something in the breast pocket.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Yeah.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:06]** And if you remember, you found something in the central hub that was like this.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:11]** You find what appears to be a gray security card, but it is damaged.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:19]** It could be repaired, but you think it could be damaged and repaired using the other one that you found.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:25]** Maybe using the two of those, you're able to repair that and get a working security key card.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:30]** Now, you all were just looking at the podium.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** You were looking at the gray.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Was there anything else you wanted to look at in the room in general?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Do you want to do a perception check on the room?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yes.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Okay.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Who is doing the perception check?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** I don't want to do perception.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** Okay.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** Got two.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Three.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Rick doesn't see me.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** I seem very distracted.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** I rolled a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** You rolled a two.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** Nico.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:58]** I rolled a, let's see here.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** I rolled an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** 18.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:07]** You think something looks familiar about the airlock door that's to the west, that's on the west side of the room?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** Can't quite tell what it is.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** It does look familiar.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:18]** Other than that, there doesn't seem to be anything else in the room except for the data in these things.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:23]** It does appear that they're still projecting, but sometimes they'll go off.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** And then they'll come back on.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** The data is moving slower.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Nothing's moving in the podium.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** The podium seems like it's powered down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I actually misread.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** I can't actually roll a 2.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** I got a 12.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** 12.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** That's fine.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** Looking at the brains on the roof, are they hard fastened in there?

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Or is it possible to take them down?

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** You could take them down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:46 - 00:32:11]** down you could destroy them you could do whatever you want they seem like they are like hardwired into something that is like holding them there and then and then like going through the brain to project the information down like they're a conduit for information for sorting information these brains belong to people who were probably taken from their homes and and experimented on i i think we should try to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:41]** remove them Niko wants John so Niko is going to roll to for the awareness and possible kind of perception that maybe these minds were simulations of what we saw in the chimera oh you think this is like that's that brain is losing when that brain is sneaky in the same spirit of that here's we'll try to get that console up and running to see if that's possible maybe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** You're pretty sure the console's not going to run.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:51]** It seems like whenever the gray died, the key card and the console both shut down.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** They locked down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:58]** Are they integrated into this mechanism somehow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:04]** Would it be possible to repair the key card and then connect to the system yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** I will try whatever.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** I certainly have the skills for that.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** I can assist in computers.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** If you and Nico could help out.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** That would be engineering or computers, would you say, for repairing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Wait, does Kelly say that?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Huh?

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Here sounds a lot like Kelly lately.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Okay.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** I'm sorry it wasn't in character enough.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** I want to repair the key card.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:29]** So anyone who's good at that, help me out.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I'm doing it.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** And I guess it's probably, I'm just going to say computers because I'm better at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** It's engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** It's engineering, which I'm less good at, but still good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** All right.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:44]** And Nico, give me a either life science or physical science check about your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** I can assist.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Sure.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** What was the thing that he was asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** Actually, I can't do that type of skill.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** I'm not trained in that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** You ask it out loud.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:03]** You ask it and what does Dr. K say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** Can I try a medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** Why don't you just ask me to look into it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Nico's just going to wonder aloud.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Nico's going to wonder aloud.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:19]** I wonder if these brains were part of the simulations powering whatever we saw in there.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** Because I can only assume that that's what we saw.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** It's the only thing that's even close to the truth here.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:34]** Is that these brains that are registering data were transmitting information.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** Because Lozu just dropped dead and this ship seems to be falling apart.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:42]** What if there's damage done to this room and one of the brains fell and it was Lozu's?

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:47]** And she just collapsed as a result of the information interruption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** That is an interesting theory.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:52]** I would have to concur with that if that's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Agreed.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:59]** Anybody know how to take a look at these brains anymore for any type of information?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** I have some ability and probably the doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** I can take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** If you guys handle that, I can handle the repair on the key card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:12]** Uh, well, uh, here's helps with the key card or P rolled a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** So, so it's an engineering check.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I'll assist.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Okay.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** So yeah, let's, let's go through this.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** So you're, what's your assist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:29]** Rick walks over and he points at the key card and says like, uh, if you connect that wire to that wire and he's right, it helps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Oh, so you ate as well?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** I got a 16 for my assist.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** So it's two eights.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** So it's plus four.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** So it's 18.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Yeah, you're putting it together.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:40]** You take a few minutes and you're like, I think I can get it to work.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:49]** And as you get everything set up, there's a little purple, you know, bar of light at the top that like comes on.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** So you were successful in repairing it.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** All right, we did it.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:00]** Now, the question that you have about your theory, Nico, you can roll life science or physical science.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** I'll also allow a computer's check for a different type of insight.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** So maybe Dr. O'K, you roll one.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Nico, you can roll another.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** I'll roll another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** Yeah, I rolled a 29 on the life science.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Here's assist on computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** 29 from Dr. O'K on the life science.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** 22 for Nico.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** 25.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** And here's your assisting.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** 25.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** So you assisted.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Cool.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** Yeah.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** You all are fairly certain of two things.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:38]** One, the computer in this room, this is what I was saying, Dr. Okay, where you did another, I think I told you, this room seems like it's the data foundry for the rooms that you guys found the files for.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** So there's nothing here.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:47]** It wouldn't make, it seems like whatever the chimera, whatever was going on there, whatever, like control window.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Not here.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** It is unrelated to here.

**[00:36:50 - 00:37:03]** As far as the brains go, you're fairly certain that that kind of a technology where the brains are part of what's going on on the Chimera, combined with the fact that you're like, I don't think these are related.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:07]** There's a lot of technology that you've seen here that is outlandish.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** I never thought this would even exist ever.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** It's probably not out of the realm of possibility, but it's probably not what happened here.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** It's likely not.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Yeah.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Okay.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:20]** That was probably used for funneling and thinking through information that's here and running calculations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:25]** But Dr. Okay, my next question is, are these brains still alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** I can do a medicine check on that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** I aid with that.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Would it be a medicine check?

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** I would also say that with your life science check, you rolled so high that I think you would know.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** They are not alive.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** They're not alive.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** They're processors.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** They are stimulated just enough to move through and think through information.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** Anything that has to do with emotion, memory, anything like that has been wiped out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** As I said, liabilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** You keep using that word.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** I'm not sure you know what it means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Oh, come on.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** You totally missed the opportunity for a Princess Bride reference there.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:11]** Accessing Webster's Dictionary liability is... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** I don't think that's what it means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** What do you think it means?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** You are at a position.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** You are thinking, maybe I'm going to rest.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Maybe I'm going to do a short rest.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:25]** Maybe I'm going to do some sort of a long rest, even though I don't know what will happen.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** There's a door here.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** There's also a door back in the central hub.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** You guys never went through the doors on the other side?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** Yes, I think we should go explore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:38]** Do you want to check to see what's on the other side of this room, this door here first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:47]** Nico's going to say as he takes one more look at the gray body, like, be great to interrogate one of these things, but they keep on blowing their own brains out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Exactly.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** It blew itself up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** You helped it, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** That's not what I saw, but I don't know.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** It is pretty jarring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** These things are very dangerous.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** They are.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:06]** And that is why I think we should rest for a little bit.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** I don't know.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** I don't want to die here.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:14]** So can I, like, find out how the state of this thing as an engineer?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Sure.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** All right.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** Just want to, like, see how this place is holding up.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** So the engineering check is a 16.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Can you help out, Nico?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Yes.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** Killbot.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** I can help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Thanks, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** I'm taking a look.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** That's a 23 for me on the assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Great.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** I got 11 passes, right?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** So it's just a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Yep.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Yep.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** So total plus two.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Plus two.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Oh, so total 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** This room, mostly unharmed.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:54]** You think it's probably due to a lot of the infrastructure that's allowing these brains to be here.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:59]** For some reason, and because maybe the door that's on the west, it seems like a pretty heavy door.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** It seems like this room is mostly unharmed.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:10]** Maybe a couple cracks here and there, but nothing like the other rooms that clearly are, you know, totally damaged.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Cracks everywhere, things falling down.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** You think...

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:20]** It's likely that the other rooms are cracked from whatever external thing is happening.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Why is this place rumbling?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Why is there an earthquake?

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Why are things falling down?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Why are the lights going out?

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** The lights haven't gone out in this room.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:36]** And then thinking about some of the other information that you have, you think maybe some of this damage was done in the other rooms.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:42]** It could be that not all of this damage was from whatever's happening externally.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** Sometimes there might be damage from things that have happened internally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:51]** I mean, it's a risk, but here's, it's going to press this point and see if the party agrees.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** What can we do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** We can find a way off of this heap.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Pronto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** Nico is saying, let's take a rest.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** But whatever we do, the next thing we need to be doing is we need to find some answers.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** We need to know where we are, what the hell is going on, and who's in charge now.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** We don't know the truth about anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** I'd rather have my life than the answers, frankly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** So would I, which is why I'm trying to do this.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** But I get where you're coming from.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** I totally do.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** This is a tough vote.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** It's tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** I want to look at this airlock.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Is there a window?

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** There's no window.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:51]** okay well could i i said suggest that we open the airlock see what's on the other side of it and then possibly secure this room or find another room that's more suitable for you to rest but i am willing to stay up the night to protect us all right let's do it great we all have environmental suits right yeah do we want to clear this out do that

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** Rick will move and kneel down with his laser rifle pointing at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** I'm assuming that... Pointing at what?

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:02]** Can we, like, figure out the controls for the airlock?

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** 23.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:14]** The reason why this door looks familiar to Nico... Nico, you were super close.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:20]** The reason why is because, Rick, you realize that...

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:26]** This door, like the other airlock doors, has a camera in it.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:30]** You would realize that the key card could work.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** The key card could open it.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** You could try and force it with the computers if you wanted to.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:39]** Or you could try and do something with the gray hand signals.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:44]** But it seems like the key card might be a ticket to opening it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Does somebody have that key card?

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** I have the key card.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** I have it.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Rick reaches out to get it from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** He walks up and presses it to the door.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** Sorry.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** What were you saying, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** I said Rick put his hand out to grab it from you as you walk past him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Whatever works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:10]** So Rick points his gun at the double doors and waits for Hears to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** Hears presses the card to the door.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Pachoo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** You go to open the... One second.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** I don't like pauses whenever we're opening doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:46]** It opens pretty easily, and much like when you were leaving the room that was kind of a decontamination chamber...

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:53]** There's just a small little vestibule that you all see.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** 10 by 10 room.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Leads to another door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** Shoot.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** There's nothing.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Is there windows or anything on that one that we clicked through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** If you all wanted to open that door, you could open that door.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Seems like it goes on to somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** Nico's going to be curious and he's going to start to step over to that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:22]** We're all prepared for decomp, right?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** Like decompression.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** We all have our environmentals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** I am always prepared for that.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:35]** Let's do so with caution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** So metagaming, this is like the end of the map.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** This door is like up against the edge of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** So we're going to decompress the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:46 - 00:45:16]** no no I just I don't know where it leads it could be a dead end or John has another whole map to take us to which means it would be like the end of this level we're moving forward I'm just saying what do you guys want to do Rick keeps his gun trained on those doors and he looks at the others for confirmation okay here's just shrugs Nico is at the ready with everybody else now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:42]** can't really see much on the map i'm going to it's just a small chamber uh i will do this are you guys who was opening the door nico sorry no rick's here no no it's not me i'm not opening that door i think the people that want to press on and i think they should be taking so inquiring rick will walk up to the door and push the button


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:46]** Rick walks open to the door and pushes the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Did we do our 10 minutes or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Did you get your 10 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** I'm not going to do 10 minutes because it's not worth it for me because the result points thing.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** The door opens slowly.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** One side kind of tilts, leans to the other side.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** I'm going to move you guys to the next map.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** Told you.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** Dust hangs thick in the air in this roughly octagonal room.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:35]** Cracks run through the smooth stone ceiling and floor, as well as the wall to your right, which has all this dull metal paneling on it.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:49]** Resting along the wall is this hollow frame of gold and silver wires running from floor to ceiling, just like thick wires wrapped around.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:56]** They're all twisting in intricate patterns, form these several hollow hemispheres along the length.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:03]** There's a machine made of these shards of smoky crystal that anchors the wires.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** This is all along that northern wall, right?

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** And it forms these small hemispheres that are hollow along the length.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** And each crystal fits into this tight pattern.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:20]** So just picture this complex machinery of silver, gold wires, crystals, things holding it all in place.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:30]** There are these blue lights that form in the crystals and then move through the wires as if information seems to be going through.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** But then at some point they stop.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** It seems like it could be broken completely.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:41]** But when they do go through, they go into holes in the wall or the floor and they loop back into this crystal machine.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:48]** Southwest corner, a chair and a desk and a computer workstation smashed.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** There's debris and rubble all throughout the area.

**[00:47:52 - 00:48:00]** And there seems to be some sort of a humanoid form along the rubble where the workstation was.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** So what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:07]** So is there another door or is this just a closed chamber?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** There's a door on the other side of the room.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Okay.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Directly across.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** It's a single door.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** There's no.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:14]** Yeah.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Single door.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** So do you guys want to stay in the room?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Do you want to keep going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** Is it still shaking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Like, do we sense that we've.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Yep.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** The shaking has continued.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** It seems like whatever is plaguing that area is also plaguing this area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Rick will step into the room cautiously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Okay.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Can I roll perception for like.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Sure.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** To see what happened here or is there like, is this like trapped?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** I agree.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** I'm going to roll perception as well.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Okay.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** So you guys are going to roll perception.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Sorry.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** No, no, no.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:54]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Hold on.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I forgot to add my modifier.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:58]** 22.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** 15 was the natural roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** 22.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** 26.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Right?

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Was that right, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Yes.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Okay.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Rick, you step in.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** You can just barely make out and see what's going on here in me.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** The light is still mostly good from the ceiling.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** It's not dim light.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Flickers occasionally, but you're fine.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:39]** But you step in, and Rick, because you speak Aklo, you understand this, but in your brain, you just hear this noise.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:57]** angry vicious noise of like what did you do with them you do not belong and this creature that looks like a gray but is on all fours and has this sharp set of teeth that are

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:09]** filled with blood and a tail with a stinger on it, leaps out from over behind the wreckage and runs over to attack you.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** Rick, roll for initiative.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Just Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** All of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Crap.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** Oh, that's a natural one for me.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** So I got four total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** All right.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Let's give me one second.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:30]** Let me pull up the classic Don John initiative tracker.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Nico, you said you got a 4.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:36]** Anybody else get in the 5 to 10 category?

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Or the less than 10 category?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** I got 8.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** 8 from Rick.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** 9 from Piers.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** 9 from Piers.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Save us.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** 17.

**[00:50:49 - 00:51:14]** 17 17 okay so dr okay standing right there because you didn't come in this this you didn't like hear any of this in your head but rick it makes sense that you rolled so low because you're just like what like i thought we were going to be decompressed and now we're in this room now this creature's charging at me and it's crazy and we are going to go into round one it is the creature's turn so where is it on the map

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** Oh, let me turn it away from the GM layer.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** Oh, it's so nice.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** There we go.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:30]** It is across the way, and it is going to move very swiftly.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:35]** Give me un momento por favor.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Yes.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** It runs rapidly.

**[00:51:41 - 00:52:02]** mentally shouting you do not belong you do not belong in your head rick runs over to you and right before it leaps as if it's charging you like literally using the mechanic charging you but it just comes up to attack you and these teeth come at you and try and grab onto your leg

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** That is a 31 to hit.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:16]** And these gnarled, gross teeth come in, grab onto your leg for 11 points of damage.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And I'm going to need you to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:54]** shouldn't have done this yeah I don't think so either my will is a 12 I have a bad feeling about this a 12 something about the voice and the bite and everything just gets in your brain and you are shaken for three rounds because this thing is just sorry how much damage did you say I took 11 points of damage from the first attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** And there's another attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Great.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:03]** So you're shaken, minus two to attack roll, saving throw, skill checks, ability checks for three rounds.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:14]** The second attack, as it bites you and just grabs into your android body, it's also going to have its tail come up from behind it and come stab into your other leg.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:19]** That is a 16 against Casey.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Is that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** That does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** All right.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:28]** That is another 11 points of damage to you.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** You're shaken for three rounds.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** That was from last time.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:38]** Technically, I think you would have the psychic terror again, but I think it's fine.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Should we run?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** You guys can run.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** That was the creature's turn.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** It is Dr. K's turn.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:53]** I want to get the heck out of here because I'm like not in the... I can't fight, man.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** I got nothing.

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:01]** I could burn a med pack if I had one, I think, but I don't think I have one.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** I thought you do.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Unless we had one from earlier.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** I thought you do have some Stimpaks.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Unless I just did not Stimpaks.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:26]** uh add it to my equipment on here i'm pretty sure we did because at the end of the didn't you grab some in professor uh ben yeah that's possible i think you grabbed like four if i can do that then i can hit them with a pharmacological and i can get back in this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** I mean, Rick's about to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** Dude, it's no joke.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** How effective would a run be?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** I mean, can it just, like, come after us?

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Or is there a way to totally disengage in Diagra?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** We could try to shut the door.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:42]** Also, could we, like, go back into the airlock and just lock it?

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** You could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** I'm confused.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:49]** Like, why would that gray lock this door on us knowing, oh, I guess maybe he didn't know this thing was here.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Or they didn't know this thing was here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** Or maybe he did and they just didn't play it nicely together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Maybe.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Do you want to roll a wisdom check and I can give you another thought?

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Is it Will's turn?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Okay.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Whose turn is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Who's rolling?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** It's Dr. O'K's turn.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Oh, okay.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Oh, I can roll that.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Okay.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** You wanted wisdom?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Yeah.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:14]** I got a 15 on my wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** 15.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** I'll say this.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:20]** The reason why this door was locked could be tied to the creature.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:27]** Could also just be tied to the fact that maybe this grade didn't want you to leave that room to get to where you are now.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** What are you going to do?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Are you going to use it?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** Again, I'm pretty sure you have four Mark I healing serums.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** Oh wait, Rick, what did you roll?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** For what?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** For your will save?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** 12?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** 13?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** No, you rolled a 12.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** 12?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Yeah.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** But it's a mind affecting emotion and fear effect.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Don't you get a plus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** It's a mind affecting.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** I get a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:54]** You're not shaken, but not shaken, but I'm still dying.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** You're fine.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:59]** So both times with both hits, the pressure in your mind, again, you just felt it with the gray.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:03]** Now you feel it with this gray carnivorous creature.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:12]** Like the pressure almost overwhelms you, but you're just able to push through and focus on maybe like the pain that you're feeling or something real and

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:16]** to steal yourself from being shaken, even though you're about to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:22]** Yeah, Rick is still super calm, but he's going to say, like, retreat, get back, shut these doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:31]** Okay, John, can I, like, do I know if I can, like, sort of engineer a door to stay shut?

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** Like, if we're on the other side of it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** Sure, you could try and do that.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Also, Dr. K, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:41]** Also, other thing... My bad, I'm talking out of turn, I just realized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:45]** I want to use the healing serum, but I don't know how to use it because I don't have it in my equipment checklist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** Restores hit points when administered.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** It's 1d8 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** Oh, but no stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** No.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** But you can get stamina with 10 minutes.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** You can't get hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Right.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:01]** There's no way for me to burn a resolve point now and get stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** I don't think so.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Not during combat.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Unless you were to, like, go down or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:06]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** You could just knock yourself out and go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:38]** no uh i guess i'm gonna push up and try to attack him with the syringe spear without any just just to stab at him not doing any other property but you want to fight this thing i thought we're gonna try to retreat you can also heal retreating okay i could or do a retreat check on rick yep or that for sure whatever you want to do on your turn

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Now let's retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Okay.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** So do you run back into the room, Pierce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Or Dr. K?

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Can I, like, pull Rick out?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Give him a, like, boost?

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:53 - 00:58:00]** Hey, sorry, just so everybody knows, magic, sorry, serum of healing is under magic gear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** It's magic gear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Yeah.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Yeah.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** It's a magic item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Okay.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** So you could pull Rick.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:11]** I think if you do, this thing will get an attack opportunity to Rick not moving away in a disengaging fashion.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Guard and step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:22]** So I'm going to just level my weapon and ready if... I mean, I'll take that mark one if you want to stab me with it.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** I would like to be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** I'll take it.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** I'll take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:36]** I'll stab him then with the Mark I. You stab him with a Mark I. I think the person who stabs rolls the hit points.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** That could apply.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** So 1d8?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** Yep, 1d8.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** So Dr. K, roll 1d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Oh, Dr. K rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Yeah, because he stabbed.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Whoever does it, he only gets to roll.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Come on, big money.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Come on, big money.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:50]** Eight.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Eight.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Eight.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Yes.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Nice.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Full hit points.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Well done.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** Awesome.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Awesome.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** Awesome.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** Awesome.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** Awesome.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** This is some tough stuff.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** Now it is.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Here's your turn.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Rick, do you need help getting out of here?

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** We're going to try to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I will be able to get myself out.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Just focus on shutting that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** All right.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Come on.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** Gears opens the door.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:02]** Oh, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Yeah.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Good question.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** That's exactly what I'm trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** Okay.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Because I'm trying to make it clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Rick, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Rick is going to take a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Boom.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** So now he's in this room.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Okay.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:23]** And then he's also going to, at that same time, he drops his artillery laser behind him.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** Yeah.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** And then he pulls out his great axe.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Actually, I changed my mind.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:35]** I'm not going to do that because I'm now outside of his range, so I won't take an attack of opportunity.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:41]** So Rick, as he steps back and he lifts his gun and he's just going to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** And he shouts, get this door shut.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]** Oh, that's a 17 plus 8 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** 17 plus 8 to hit.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** That is going to be a hit against KAC or EAC?

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** EAC.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** All right.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Boom.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:06]** And that's a D10, which is this one.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** When can I do a swift action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Say again?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** You can always do a swift action, but I apologize if I didn't ask if you want to do anything else on your turn.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Because you moved past your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]** Well, I want to slime this now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** I would normally say yes, but now we're two people past your turn.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** So I think we're going to leave hands off the chess piece on that.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** So it's five points of damage.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:35]** Five points of damage as this thing gets hit.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:41]** And as it gets hit, you hear the scream in your mind of pain from it.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:45]** Nico, unless you want to do anything else with your turn.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** That's all I can do.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** That's all you can do.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** Okay.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Nico, what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:58]** So Niko, with his blaster, he is going to do a combat expertise shot.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Okay.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** So this was something I forgot I had.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:14]** And what it does is, so long as I have a resolve point, it doesn't cost a resolve point, so long as I have a resolve point, as a standard action, I can make an expertise attack as an attack action.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:21]** Prior to my attack, I can attempt a skill check using the chosen skill with a DC equal to 15 plus...

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:24]** One half your target CR.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** Okay.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:34]** If you succeed at the check and your attack hits, you roll your expertise die and add the result to your damage roll, and the target is shaken for one round.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Okay.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** I like it.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:37]** I like it.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:37]** I like it.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:44]** So I'm using a bluff combat expertise attack here.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** Okay.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:50]** First, I think I roll my bluff check first, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:50]** Yep.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:50]** Yep.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** It's going to be DC 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** DC 16?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:55]** Yep.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** Well, that was a 13 natural plus 9.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** You got it.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** That's 22.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Okay.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:27]** i like it uh 14 plus 4 that's 18 to hit 14 plus 4 18 to hit that is it does have does have soft cover though right it does have soft cover also i realized that uh it has the same phase ability so technically rick you should have rolled a 20 chance we already passed it it's it's fine you're fine

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:31]** So that was an 18 to hit with a soft cover, which is plus two.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** I think that would still be a hit.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]** What was your D100 roll, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** I'm making it right now.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:42]** So for D100, it's the 100 die and then the D10 die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** Correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** Yep.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** That's a 71.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:49]** 71.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** All right.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** You're good.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** That attack does hit.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** So nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:56]** Now I roll my D4 plus a D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:20]** four oh four plus three four plus three seven points of damage to this thing yeah hold on four plus one sorry five plus three sorry because i forgot to add my um combat specialization with small arms into it okay uh does hero lab already add that in though

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** It has the 1d4 plus 1.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** I forgot to add the plus 1.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** Got it, got it.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:30]** It was a 4 on the die roll, plus 1, plus the 3 on the expertise.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:30]** Nice.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** A total of 8 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:43]** The 8 over Rick's shoulder, hitting the other shoulder of the creature, and now Rick and Nico, you hear this scream from, you do not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:43 - 01:05:04]** belong in your heads that hurts my voice in your heads as this pressure goes through I got something for my bluff check though so Nico as he takes the shot he's gonna say hello there and he's gonna take the shot and he shoots now the creature is shaken for one round two


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:07]** The creature is shaken for one round.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:10]** Ooh, taste of its own medicine.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:13]** Minus two to attack, roll a saving throw, skill checks, ability checks.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:14]** Love it.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** Cool.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** I'm going to add that in right now.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** Okay.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:22]** It is the top of round two.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Guess whose turn it is.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** The horrible alien creature.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]** This beautiful specimen.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]** It's like a gray xenomorph.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** Yeah, it's like a friggin' feral gray.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** It is.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:38]** It is awesome.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Is it called a feral gray?

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:40]** No.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:45]** But you could do a life science check to kind of put together stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Rick cannot do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:48]** There are types.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:48]** Dr.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:51]** O.K., you leveled your weapon at it.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** I don't think that you hit.

**[01:05:52 - 01:06:00]** I think the only person who really hit, and it can't get to Nico, so I think, unfortunately, it's going to attack Rick again.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** That's the only thing.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** It's the only person.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** Sorry, I didn't mean to call you a thing, Rick.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** The only person that you can get to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:10]** It is shaken, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** Yeah, so it gets minus two to its attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** So there's a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** There is a chance.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:26]** But it runs up, shakes its head like its tail whips back and forth, and it steps up and goes to bite you again.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** Come on, roll low, roll low, roll low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** That is a 20 with a minus 2.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** Get your KSC.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Oh, yeah, that hurts.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:39]** So, Rick, are you frozen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** No, no, I'm just... I just fear for my life.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** What?

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** I just fear for Rick's life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Yeah, we're all fearing.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** I also fear for Rick's life.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:51]** Come on now, Rick.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** All right.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:55]** That's 10 more points of damage as the bite comes in.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:58]** I am on the verge of death.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** On the verge of death.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:02]** Dr.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:05]** O.K., what are you doing on your turn?

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:06]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:27]** i don't know what i want what we can do we're trying to retreat uh i can attempt to attack him and draw some of his ire but i won't last much longer than rick here's in the room behind you okay john what's the state on this thing is it pretty beat up

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:28]** No.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** I don't think so.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** Yeah.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** I mean, you've dealt some good damage for sure.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** Is it beat up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:38]** Is Rick able to move?

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** Yes.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:42]** You would have to do a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** So would you, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** Okay, so I'm going to await.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:56]** I'm going to hold an action for when Kev moves back from his guarded step.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:59]** I'm also going to move back.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:12]** But at the same time, I'm going to excrete two more blocks of slime, creating a barrier between us and said gray.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** Isn't Nico behind you?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** He didn't leave the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** Yeah, Nico didn't leave.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:24]** Also, you're going to delay your... If you're going to delay... Sorry, here's... I moved you in case... Oh, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:24]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:29]** Yeah, just in case one of them wanted to move into the previous square.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:46]** so because if you delay is that a standard action or is that like can you do anything else if you delay well it's not it's a swift action so it's actually just slime yeah okay i mean you do they have to be adjacent squares or can you just do two adjacent squares empty

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:50]** And if you move without a guarded step, it's going to get an attack opportunity on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Against myself?

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:56]** Yeah, because you are in a threat square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:59]** So, basically, I want to do it, like, one after another.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:01]** Where?

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** To, like, one step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:06]** Wait, Nico, did you use a full turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:10]** It's a standard action.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** That was my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:14]** Well, a standard action is not a full turn, so you still have a move action.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Did you want to move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** Are we retreating?

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** Like, is that really?

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** Yes, we're retreating.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** Yes, we're going to die.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** All right.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** So, yeah, Nico's going to move back into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** Okay.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** So you moved back.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** I'll put you right here.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** Here's I'll put you right here.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** You guys are just on the other side.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:30]** Okay.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:33]** So, Dr. K, you want to move and slime?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:48]** but I'm going to delay the slime I'm going to take a guarded step back and I'm going to hold an action I guess to slime when Rick moves out of this occupied square


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:50]** You still have a standard action, right?

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** It's a swift action.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:54]** Can you do a swift action and delay?

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:01]** I want you to do this, but I don't know that you can ready or delay and then also do an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** No, he's delaying his action.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** So he's doing his move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:06]** I'm doing my move action now.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:09]** I'm doing the swift action on a delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:10]** I think that's different.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:13]** So it's either you can delay your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]** Right, that's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** Or you can delay just the action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:19]** So you're readying an action because your trigger is Rick moving?

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Yes.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** Got it.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:23]** So you're readying an action.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:27]** So the question is, can you use a swift action and ready an action?

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:30]** I think you can by using a standard action.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:32]** Well, you decide on a standard move or swift action.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:35]** The slime is a swift action, right?

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** To use the slime?

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:36]** Okay.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:45]** So you essentially use your action to ready an action of a swift action, and the trigger is Rick moving.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:46]** Sure.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:50]** And I would say it is purely defensive.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** Well...

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:52]** This is important.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** Is the slime, is you using the slime purely defensive?

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:56]** I think it is.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:57]** Yes.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:58]** Yeah.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:58]** Yeah.

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:01]** So it would happen before the event that triggers it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:03]** Well, his trigger is going to be me backing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:04]** Okay.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Does that matter?

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** Because it needs to be empty.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:09]** But it does say, it says it's a standard action to ready an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** Yeah.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:13]** So you would use your standard action, ready an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** To ready his swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:15]** Yeah.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:20]** And you would use your move action to move back and you would be readying your swift action to happen on the trigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:23]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]** I totally agree, but I'm not going to lie.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:27]** We need to get it right.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:38]** We need to get it right because if you guys die, there needs to be no question that the steps that happened before one of you went down were all by what we feel like was right.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:38]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:41]** I mean, like, I don't even think this slime's really going to help anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:43]** It'll slow them down.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** So, yeah.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:51]** I think he moved, and then he used his standard action to ready his swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:51]** Yep.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** And your move action was the guarded step back.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** Okay.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:54]** Cool.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:57]** Is it Ryan's turn now?

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** Get the hell out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** Run.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** Yeah.

**[01:11:59 - 01:11:59]** Here's.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** It's your turn.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:00]** What do you do?

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:01]** Oh, okay.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:06]** Well, here's wants to remember who's probably going to move next, the gray or Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:08]** Well, can you shut this door?

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:09]** Shut this door.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:09]** In front of you?

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:16]** The one that's between me and the- It's going to be here, and then Rick, and then Nico, and then round three.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:17]** The top round three.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:20]** There's a door right here, is what Kev's saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:21]** Yeah, there's a door right there.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:24]** Okay, so close it.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** So, hold on a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:27]** Rick or Dr. Okay could have closed that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** Oh, the buttons are near us?

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:32]** The buttons are not on the other side to close the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:36]** Dr. Okay, use your standard action to shut the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:39]** All right, so Rick goes before the alien will.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** Okay, all right, the gray.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** We're all aliens.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:51]** All right, so Heroes goes up, and if he's not going to be attacked, because he's trying to remember how this freaking works right now, but if he's not going to be attacked by the alien, he'll close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** Wait, what?

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** He's going to walk back?

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** Come back in, you're like, no.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:58]** Oh, shit, the controls are over there.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** Don't do that.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** I don't get it.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:02]** Hold on.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** We forgot this button is right next to us.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** Close it.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** I'll close it on my turn.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:15]** Just delay your turn until after my turn and I'll close the door and then you try to close the other door when we all get out.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** Just delay your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** But then I'll just lose an entire turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:25]** No, you just get moved back in initiative order to behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:29]** Okay, so I can go sooner than I otherwise would if I were to just... Okay, cool.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:31]** I'll delay my turn.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** Okay, so you delay your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:39]** Okay, so what kind of action does it take to shut the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:41]** I would say that it would be like a move action.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** Pretty sure a used item is move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** I'm going to push the button.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** Door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:49]** Door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:54]** And then... Fuck, because now Dr. Okay can't move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** What do you mean?

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:58]** Are we still in initiative?

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** You are still in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:07]** Because if it breaks through the door or is able to open the door itself, Rick's going to hold his position.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** Okay.

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:13]** No, Rick will do a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:15]** Well, you would need to, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Well, Dr. O.K.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** can now slime.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** You can also just move back.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:22]** You're right.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** Without a guarded step.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** I wanted to do a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:24]** All right.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:26]** Just want to make sure you knew that.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:29]** So, Dr. K. I drop prone and crawl back.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** I only move in prone now.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:44]** Dr. K., it jumps to your turn, and you now slime the floor.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:46]** Yeah, you're right.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:50]** That's too good.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:54]** That's good.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:54]** All right.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** So you slime that there.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** The door shuts.

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:04]** I'm going to move Dr. K down to right after Rick and Nico.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:11]** Nico is going to pull out his dueling sword and just point his pistol at the door in case anybody comes in.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:15]** And then he's going to move back further into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:18]** Okay, so you step back into the room.

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:19]** Okay.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** Tough.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:32]** On the other side of the door, top of round three, you hear... I can say without having to roll a life science check, these things are cunning.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:38]** It's got some tricks up its sleeve, but I'm going to give it a certain amount of time to decide if it wants to pursue you.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:41]** It doesn't want you where you were.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:43]** I'm going to roll a percent to see what it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:46]** My heart is thumping here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:47]** I should have just shut that.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** I should have fused that door together.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:50]** That's what I should have done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:55]** I think we should get out of this area pronto.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:59]** So can we do like a tactical retreat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** Shoulda, woulda, coulda.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:02]** Shoulda, woulda, coulda.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** Doesn't come through in the six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:33]** i delayed my turn so now it's my turn is that right it it is now your turn if you didn't do anything with your delay it comes back to you then yeah you get to do whatever you want to do right okay well here's tells the everyone like all right get on the other side of this door we're gonna try to fuse it shut and if uh you know nico you can help me with that that'd be awesome and um i think what else the hell can i think that might be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:36]** That's a successful assist.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** That's a seven on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:41]** We're not doing it yet, though, because they're... You're also still an initiator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:44]** I mean, you could just, like, spend your last turn and wait for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** We just go... Yeah, I'll do that.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** You just go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:48]** Okay.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:48]** You go in.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Rick, it's your turn.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Does Dr. O.K.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** go before me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** No, Dr. O.K.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** moved because of the ready action.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:58]** You mean like completely... That's what happens when you're ready in action.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:01]** Sorry.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** It's fine.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:08]** Were you saying like delay my turn again or just like just not... Yeah, but we're still in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:11]** I thought you could shut this door from remotely.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** That's why I was saying that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:12]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:15]** But you can only shut the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]** So I'm just going to exhaust my turn if I do nothing though.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]** I'm not like delaying it strategically or anything like that.

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:42]** yeah you're you're just exhausted that's fine because we're just trying to put space between us sure uh but there is something that maybe i can try to help us out um can i like i have this cantrip where i can create sounds for distraction or like you know pulling like some creature away from us potentially um but i don't know if i can do it through doors that's the thing

**[01:17:42 - 01:18:10]** what is what is this it's called um ghost sound um you create a volume sound that rises falls recedes approaches etc um it can produce as much noise as 20 normal humans you can do shouting singing talking marching running blah blah blah you can do different creatures with the roar of an alien the range is 25 plus five per each second for each two levels so i guess like it's like 30 feet because i'm like level three


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:10]** I don't know.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:13]** Part of me wants to say that you would have to be able to see where you're casting it.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:17]** But I have been there in that room.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:21]** I kind of want to let the dice aside and say that if you want to cast it, that's fine.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** But you would roll a percent chance to see whether it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** Okay.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:27]** So 5, 10, 15, 20, 21.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:30]** It'll kind of hit where that desk is.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** So I don't know.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:32]** We'll see if this works.

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:34]** Might as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:36]** So you're picturing the desk.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** You're picturing what you remember of it.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:40]** What kind of sound are you trying to make?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:43]** I can't do a specific thing.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:47]** So it's going to be like, yeah, I'll do the roar of an alien predator.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** That sounds pretty good.

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:49]** So then like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:49]** Okay.

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:50]** Of predator.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** Yeah, it's literally predator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** So he's like, I forget what sound he makes.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:57]** It's like a clicking sound, right?

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:00]** I can't.

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:01]** There you go.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]** But it's like, it's, it needs to be, it's loud as hell though.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:05]** It's loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:07]** So you might be able to hear it.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:30]** that's how you would know if it worked or not it's a it's a dc of 15 it's a cantrip so i don't i don't think i roll or dc 15 for what that's what i roll that's what i would roll right it's will disbelief it's a yeah so roll so you so you cast it roll to see whether it works if it does work i'll roll we'll save it's to see whether it happens yeah 16

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:33]** Oh, you were trying to... That's what you rolled on a D100?

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** Oh, it's a D100?

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** Yeah, because it's a chance.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:38]** Oh, okay.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** All right, cool.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:40]** I'll do that right now.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:44]** Above 50 would be that it worked.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:45]** Below 50 would be that it doesn't.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:45]** It's 44.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:46]** It didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:49]** This is another one of those hard arguments on wording.

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:51]** It just says within 25 feet.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:53]** It doesn't say within visual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:53]** Yeah.

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:56]** I think it makes sense that you're trying to picture it.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** It might work.

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:58]** It might not because you're not sure.

**[01:19:59 - 01:19:59]** It doesn't work.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:00]** You don't hear anything.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:05]** You felt like you were so sure that you pictured it right and the dice were not in your favor.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:13]** Maybe just the pressure of the situation, the psychic things that you maybe felt because you're telepathic.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:22]** I'm sure you picked up on some sort of an echo of its anger and ferocity and you just weren't able to pull out the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:26]** I could actually try to do it again with something, but I don't think it's worth it.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:27]** I'd rather save that for something else.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Yeah.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Okay.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:29]** It's not that much of a thing.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** So, all right, cool.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:31]** I'm done.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]** Thank you for trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:34]** Yeah.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:37]** That's a sweet, that's a sweet creative solution.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:39]** That's what's awesome.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:41]** Uh, so that was your turn.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:41]** Rick 19.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:42]** It's your turn.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:42]** What do you do?

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:45]** Get out, get the store shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:25]** To wherever it was.

**[01:21:58 - 01:22:03]** And he's going to hold a combat expertise attack in case that thing comes to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:04]** Okay.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:10]** Rick19, because without going too far into it, I'm going to say that you came back, you readied until Dr. Okay.

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:15]** I think it's fair to say that you would ready using the key card to lock the door.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:28]** Got it.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:30]** So it would have to be on here's his turn.

**[01:22:31 - 01:22:31]** The door shut.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:34]** It needs to be on here's his turn that you lock the door.

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:36]** We're at the top of round four.

**[01:22:37 - 01:22:40]** Is the creature going to get through the first door?

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:49]** You all hear and feel in your mind this like, but it becomes muffled as that door shuts.

**[01:22:50 - 01:23:04]** and you don't hear anything else you don't feel any psychic pressure from this creature and you are out of initiative order and you're safe for now and that's our game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:12]** Rick turns to Hears and he's like, I'm so sorry.

**[01:23:55 - 01:24:02]** Tactical retreat or not, I hope we're just getting ready to sit down and plot how we can blow this thing back to wherever it came from.

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:07]** Now, as it pertains to where we're at, I have no idea.

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:12]** We came from this really hectic place, and now we're in a place that we can't make heads or tails.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:17]** And on top of that, I'm hearing ex-DL me.
