**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:14]** Our heroes heed the call of our steward friends after a harangue from Shay to get back to the business of disabling the reactor about to blow our blundering battlers into oblivion.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:31]** Safely reaching the bottom of the shaft, the crew stumbles upon a trail of carnage tinged with the telltale signs of troll blood along with a small but unmistakable trace of an Akeshti dispersed among the exsanguinated gray corpses and debris strewn throughout the mirrored corridors before them.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:43]** As Rick trepidatiously treads further, dread fills our hero's hearts when a voice fills the room objecting to being put back in the shackles it once occupied.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:46]** Are our heroes about to be greeted as gracious liberators?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:53]** Or is this creature in the corner about to liberate our band of brothers' bodies from the burden of breathing?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:57]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** All right.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:54]** Well, on this episode 60, I got a little story.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** Got something that I want to say.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** It's a little.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Okay.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:05]** It's a little, you know, I'm probably overhyping it, but I'm just going to tell you.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** No, never.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:07]** No, never.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:14]** I'm going to tell you the question that I want you to think about, and then I will tell you my answer first.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:19]** And the question is, what do...

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:24]** Or who do your characters revile?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** And I'm going to tell you what I revile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Sorry.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Revile means like hate, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** I know.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** My vocabulary is very weak.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** No, it's good.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** We should have a Starfinder Storytime that's like a dictionary edition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Starfinder Dictionary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Starfinder Dictionary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** So revile, just like hate and repulsed by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** And I'll tell you what I revile.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Revile.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Personally or... Personally.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:55]** Not as all the characters in the... Every character in the... One by one.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Professor Benjamin.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:59]** Hello, super... One by one.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** This might take a while.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:28]** uh so space lice this is a bit of a roundabout story i am uh i go out and i'm having dinner with my partner and we're enjoying it and it's great and then we're about to get into the car and this place happened to have a valet and we were like this valet it's right here so i go and i get in the car and i reach over and you know the car's running because the valet is always like

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** They leave the car running.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** You tip them.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** You're like, thanks.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** And you get in and you drive off.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:37]** And I go in and I... It's like a slogan for one of the ballet companies, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** We'll leave the car running.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** Are they our sponsor yet?


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Random ballet company.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** They should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** Or like... Random ballet company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** We'll leave the car running for you.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Or is that a hotel chain?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** A hotel chain.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Motel 6.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** We'll leave the lights on.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** I'm sorry.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Bad joke.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Got too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** He's...

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** It was good, but bad, but good.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** And I laughed.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** We all laughed.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** We all laughed.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** So I reach over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** He's a dad now.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:10]** And the keys were just the car key.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** Wait, they took all your other keys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Yeah.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** And I didn't know where they were.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** And I was like, wait, where are the car keys?

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** They won't notice.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** I looked and they were in the center console.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:26]** And I was like, how and why did they take the car key off the rest of my car keys?

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** I've never had that happen.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:33]** And then it made me realize I hate key rings.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** Because I tried to put it back on waiting there in the valet line while other cars are coming in to like pull over.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** And I'm like flossing with it and trying to pull open the key thing.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It is so frustrating.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** And then it like hurts your nails.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** And then you're trying to like fingers hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** You use another key.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** Yeah.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:52]** But what if you're like, it doesn't work that way.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:55]** You know, like sometimes the geometry from somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Hey, you need to upgrade your key binding technology is the problem.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** I think I do.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** I think I need to do clips.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** There's ways now.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Yeah, we're in 2022.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Carabiners.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** Yeah, there's a little hook thing you can use.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** Anyway, I also share that hatred, John.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:11]** I totally get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:18]** But to be fair, for valet companies, you're supposed to give them just the car key because they don't want to be responsible for anything else.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:23]** So they probably took it off, shoved it in the things, and were like, not my problem.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Which is funny, they just didn't tell you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Yeah, I've just never had that happen before.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** But you know what?

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** But it's cool.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** They'll leave the car running for you.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** They'll leave the car running for you.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Yeah.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** All right.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** So tell me.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** Good point, John.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** You've had time to think.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** What do your characters revile?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** What do they hate?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Alright, no one... Calm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:48]** No one... I'll go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** This is kind of a bleed over.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:58]** A lot of times your characters in roleplay are just a projection of who you are in some form.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** This is one of the ones where it's just like a direct line between me and Rick.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** But I and Rick just like petty crime.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Like...

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:17]** The idea of somebody just, like, robbing somebody else or, like, littering, like, that kind of, like, you know, not this, like, yeah, any crime that's just, like, that makes sense.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:25]** I'm sure, like, I don't, I'm not describing this better, but anything that you're just, like, overstepping somebody else's boundaries for no real apparent reason, like, it just bothers me.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** It bothers Rick a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Like, standing too close to you or petty crime?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** Yeah, no, petty crimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** That is petty crime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Petty... Setting too close is a crime.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Pettiness.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** In general.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Yeah, pettiness in general.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** Yeah.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Yeah.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:42]** Like taking somebody's key ring off and putting it in their glove box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** Like deflating somebody's tires with tiny pebbles.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Yeah, Cash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Under the cab.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** That was deserved.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** That's different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Wait a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** It's not a crime.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** You've done so many things.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** You're so petty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** I'm petty, but they're not crimes.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** That's the difference.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** Petty crimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** It's a compound word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Moving on.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** Who's next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:17]** I detest both as a character and as a person

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:45]** the intellectual slavery and enslavement of of of people so i'm for the liberation of knowledge and uh as a as a character that's valid i love that so like the fees that you have to pay for like to read scholarly articles yes the bureaucracy the political sluggishness of academia yeah yeah all of that that's that's where i draw the line um

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Okay.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** I love it.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Awesome.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** Dr.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** O.K.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** 's a zealot.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** He's an academic zealot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Academic zealot.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Academic zealot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** It's a new phrase.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:59]** I always, playing StarCraft for a long time, thought it was zealot.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** But zealot is also a cool term.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** Pierce.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** Great zealot.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Great zealot.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:24]** Here's because of some of his history does not like trading of like human trafficking and things or I should say the trafficking of individuals or the indentured servitude of them and things like this.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** It's a specific issue with him.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** He also doesn't like cruelty to small animals, but who doesn't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:34]** Oh man, is this like insight onto like why Heroes is no longer a free captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** That's an interesting idea that you're positing, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** Someone perhaps kicked a young skittermander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Yeah.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** What the heck?

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Kicked a baby.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Punted a baby off of like a starship.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** That's terrible.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** It's horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** This is Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:53 - 00:09:11]** i'm gonna kick this baby now what's that scene with uh in in like anchorman with jack black in the and will ferrell's dog didn't you like throw the dog off like a bridge yeah oh man i forgot about that wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** What a classic movie.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Terrible.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:14]** Very much so.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** I'm sure no animals were harmed.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** No, definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** I don't recall seeing that at the end of that movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** I don't remember Jack Black being in it, but that's cool.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Maybe it was a different movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** I do recall the dog going over the bridge, though.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Definitely.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** All right.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:32]** I got, unless you guys want to talk about anything else.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Okay.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Cool.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** I'm going to change the music.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Let's cue it up.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Starfinder Storytime?

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** Starfinder Storytime?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** My favorite part of the show.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** It's so nice.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** It's so helpful.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** It puts me in the mood for some storytelling.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Everyone gather around, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Gather around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Get your hot cocoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Make sure you're with your buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Today.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:16]** We're going to be talking about Omas, or as they're better called, Space Whales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** The thing that's about to kill us?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** No.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** No.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Oh, man, that would be intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** You did encounter an Oma.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:44]** that was kind of the name of an area where you saw the monitor right and they're these giant space whales that can project electromagnetic magnetic fields right so they they they have this electrical occurrence in and around them but what i love is that they are colossal beasts

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:52]** that most of the time travel alone, but there are pods of them that migrate together across space.

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:09]** And so it's been known that sometimes they will like cause these light shows because they are migrating from place to place and their energy fields all intermingle and they light up all the gases in the area and cause this huge multicolored spectacle.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:13]** A little bit like what is going on behind Will on our test stream.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:36]** right now that maybe one day you'll see soon it looks so beautiful thank you what i but what i like about omas is that as they say the most commonly known and least understood feature is their star song a haunting telepathic melody that can be perceived thousands of miles away even across the void of space

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:45]** And like linguistic experts think that they are telling a story about the complete oral history of the universe.

**[00:11:46 - 00:12:02]** But I like this line here that goes, whatever the content of the songs, even the saltiest of space fairs can become tearily nostalgic when they recall their first experience hearing the haunting sound in the silence between worlds.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** So cool.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Just so neat.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** They're just giant space whales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** They're giant space whales, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:15]** They're giant space whales that sing and that are telling stories and might be part of some sort of culture that we don't understand or that we just don't get yet.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** It's beautiful.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:32]** I will say that there is just a section when you look them up in Packed Worlds and online that just says, Oma as starships, which would be a really interesting concept to have an Oma be

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** A starship.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yeah.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:39]** And they're called Omas because a lot of times when people hear or see them, they say, Oma.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Oma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Hey.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Kevin Decker.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** This is his last episode.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** He'll be here.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:56]** It's only been one year, listeners, since he's been a dad and already he's become like a connoisseur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** That actually was really funny.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** Oh, one last thing.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:10]** Barathus apparently used to once use Omas as living starships because their stomachs, the stomach of an Oma, is surprisingly habitable.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** That's cool.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** What's a Barathu again?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** I forget.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:18]** Barathu are the inhabitants of Bretheda or Bretheda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** We haven't encountered one yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** No, no.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** They're like giant floating beings.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Why do I have a feeling we're about to encounter one?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** They're really cool.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** I like Baratheons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** I don't want to fight an Oma either, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** By the way, Baratheons.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Here's that creature at the end of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Yeah.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Robert Baratheon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Robert Baratheon.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** Robert Baratheon.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Game of Thrones reference for anybody out there?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** Oma Greyjoy.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** All right.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Should we play?

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Yeah.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Let's play?

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Yeah.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** That was such an enthusiastic yeah from Will.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** That was great.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Yeah.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Yeah.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** That was good.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Yeah.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** It's like a... What was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** I forget the name of it.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** A dude who ran for president.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:07]** Oh, Dean Cain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** So great.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:15]** That was a thing that my friends and I said for a while when that happened.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** We would just do that in line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:22]** Completely unrelated to politics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Wow.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Great stuff.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Oh, God.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** Great stuff.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** That was pretty good.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** When politics was simple.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** That's all it was.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** That lost him the presidency.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** It really did.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** Was he eating pizza backwards with a fork or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Those were the days.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Yeah.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** All right.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** Those were the days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Moving on.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:49]** So the longer that you all have been fighting for your life and searching for a way out, the more efficient...

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:53]** You have become at identifying threats and avoiding obstacles.

**[00:14:54 - 00:15:00]** Case in point, down the shaft to the reactor area, you found an unmarked bypass tunnel.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Cautiously searched it.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** You find this unknown access door that was unlocked from the control room above by Dr. O'Key slash Bernice.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:14]** Dr. O'Key, you notice that on the other side are motion sensors.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Curious.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Yes.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:20]** You reach out to the stewards, to Shay.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** He tells you they're there to protect them.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** And where you're going leads to the area that they're in.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:38]** And worse yet, you find out that he's locked in the reactor room and the connection with him is just barely coming through, probably from the effects of the reactors nearing their breaking point.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** And so you guys say, you know what?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I'm going to make a calculated decision here.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** I'm going to go back for now.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:50]** So you go back down the shaft and you discover several shielded rooms.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:59]** One has several busted doors and three dead greys, apparently rended, dismembered.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:10]** There's another one that's a dimly lit lab where there are strange bodies lying amongst the wreckage of four test tubes.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** I'm bringing you guys over on the map here.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:19]** And in the middle of that room, there's a silhouette of a strange, thin figure standing perfectly still.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** So, again, calculated decision.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Hashtag, it's okay to walk away.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** Right, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** That's right.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Hashtag, it's okay to walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** Even though there might be things in there that are important?

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Who knows?

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Nope.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Not worth it.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** So you leave.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:41]** But the other side of that room appears to be an observation area with a two-way mirror into the room that you guys skipped out on.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:48]** So it's empty except for another smashed door on the other side.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:57]** So Rick, Hears, and Bernice, you begin to investigate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:14]** Before we go any further, John always does an excellent landing page for us where he puts in some kind of, I don't know, object or introduces some kind of key point from the last episode or upcoming episode.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** And this time...

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:30]** It flashes to a dirty mechanical hallway, and then there's a silhouette of a vicious-looking lizard, crocodile, uplifted crocodile thing.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:35]** Every time it flashes, I just see a little bit more of it, and it's just got these giant jaws.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** I'm really afraid of what's going to happen right now.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** I'm scared, too.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** But it was a really nice landing page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Yeah, great work, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Thanks.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** With maximum effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** It's beautiful, but you freak me out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Trying to up my game every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** So Rick's just going to turn around and walk away?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:52]** Nope.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** Hashtag, it's okay to walk away?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** All right.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** See how that works.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** I'm just going to go back to that pod thing.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Fall asleep.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Guess I'm going down with the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Just like, you go, man, you go.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** See ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** Gotta take care of your mental health.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Guys, I need to take a mental health day.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** You call the stewards.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** You're like, I need some time for my mental health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** You guys just clear out all these monsters for us and then we'll help you with the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** No jokes on mental health.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** So here's... Rick and Bernice, you walk into the room.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:27]** And as you do, you hear this voice that's like...

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** No, no, no, I will not go back in that cage.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** And then there's a slam on the ground.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:39]** And then, Rick, as you hear this, you realize that you heard that voice.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** Those words were in Akatonian, but you understood what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I think Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** also speaks Akatonian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Yes.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** I checked and you didn't.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** So if you do, you should change that on Hero Lab.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** I also thought you did.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** I know Rick does.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** I checked on Hero Lab and didn't see that you did.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** So if you do, change it.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Totally down with it.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Because you all hear that.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:17]** And then out of the darkness steps this hulking, large, red-scaled creature with arms that are as thick as Rick's torso.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:25]** And there's a long jaw with two massive horns coming down, almost like tusks from where its ears would be.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** And there are these sagittal horns.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** along the crest of its head, moving down its back.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:39]** They get bigger and bigger, and there's a long red tail, and it's wearing nothing but a cloth around its waist.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:44]** And as it walks out, its arms are rubbing its eyes.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:53]** Its eyes are shut, and it steps out blearily, and then one hand hits the side of its head.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** Hits the side of his head.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** And then abruptly and aggressively hits its head with both hands.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** And then it opens its eyes.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:15]** And you're just arrested by this sharp, red, completely red eye that sees you.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Oh, great.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** Bright red.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** It's almost glowing.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** And I'm going to reveal here on the map what you see.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Because it sees you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** And it goes, No.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Who are you now?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** You can't put me back in that cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:37]** And you all need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Oh, no.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Dang it.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** All right.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** What is that thing?

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Yeah.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:47]** All right.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** I rolled a one.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** I got to look at my bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:55]** Let's go around the horn here once I pull up the initiative tracker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:18]** he's a big boy big and scaly it's a big boy yeah big boy is uh kelly described for us he he's just kind of looks like a dragon that walks around he's like a dragon without like a long abdomen a dragon that walks on his two feet like a human i guess human or dragon personally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:25]** No wings, just big muscular arms, but clear scales, and then spikes down its back.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** It's got horns like... Oh, what creature is that?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:33]** The thing that the Mandalorians fought way back in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Oh, the thing...

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Oh, actually, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** That's what their symbol is based on, is the horns from the... Anyways.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** Yeah.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** And it's just got this big lizard face.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Oh!

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** It's gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** His mouth is glowing bright red as well.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** It appears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** It's eyes and his mouth.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** That's... I don't know if that's just an illusion.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** I don't know if that's just an illusion.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Dr. Okay, what'd you get?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Dr. OK rolled a 10.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** A 10.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** All right.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** But you're at the back of the room.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Maybe you're like, what?

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Okay.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Rick, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:11]** I rolled a one with four bonus for a total of five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Five.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:18]** You're also just shocked at the hulking figure that comes out of the darkness behind it.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Here's what you get.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Eight.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** Okay.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** You're also shocked.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Yeah.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:37]** Though, before we go any further, Rick wants to... Did you get a full round of everybody's initiatives?

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:44]** Rick wants to roll a culture check, I guess, would probably be... Why don't we do that on your turn during round one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:47]** I think that makes more sense just because we'll start going in order.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** There's not a surprise round, obviously, because it stepped out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:54]** I know, and I would wait till my turn, except for my turn's, like, super last because I rolled so low.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** I don't know.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** But I just... Rick recognizes this creature, is all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Dr. K might do it, too.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:04]** But it is this creature's turn, and again... Mm-hmm.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** As it says, no, I won't go back in that cage.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:13]** It reaches down and near the door that is on the floor in front of it.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:23]** It grabs this huge chunk of rock and it takes that rock and it just hurls it right at Rick.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:28]** Just overhand throws this rock at Rick.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** And I'm going to roll to see if it hits.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:31]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:52]** yeah that hits they got a 30 oh yeah of course wait how'd you get oh my god you got a 30 without a natural 20 what the okay that is going to be 48 points of damage 13 points of damage as this rock slams into you and this is just why we run away from everything that's all i'm saying

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:59]** I definitely think doing culture and all that stuff is definitely necessary.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:05]** But I will just say that as it picked up the rock, you could just tell that it seems so fluid.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** It's trained to do so.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** I'll just give you that for free.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:12]** It just seems like it is very easy for it to pick up a rock.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:17]** It almost didn't even look or hesitate and just hits Rick square in the chest.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** We're in the middle of round one.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:23]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:32]** Dr. OK is going to say, well, hey, friend, we don't want to put you in a cage.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** We're trying to get out of here.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:38]** Do you want to help wreck a reactor with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** I'd love it.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Diplomacy, I guess?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:54]** Give me a diplomacy check, and I will say that if anybody wants to help during this turn, you need to give me one line.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** So,

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:06]** As a role player, Rick or here's, you need to give me like a line, like give me something that you would say in addition to you just rolling, because this is a little out of turn.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Sure.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** Well, here's successfully assists or at least the role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:14]** And he says, yeah, we could totally get revenge on those guys who did that to you.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** We'll help you just relax.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Let's work it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Okay, Rick?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** I rolled a 10 plus whatever, so I passed.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Okay.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:30]** And he's going to just look this thing in the eye and be like, I can get you back to Akitan.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** I, too, am trying to get there.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** And so that's a plus four.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** Those were great statements.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Obviously, good rolls.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** It's a plus four to your roll, Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** What did you get?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** I rolled a 17 plus four.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** Plus my base is one, right?

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:49]** Or no.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** So five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** So 22.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** 22.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** Okay.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** All right.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:01]** You do see that some of the anger in the creature seems to just subside a little bit.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** I don't know.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** You don't know what that means yet, but it does seem like the creature heard you.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** So something might happen.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** What else do you want to do with your turn, Doctor?

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** I'm just going to...

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** I need to look up if there's a combat feat.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Combat feat or like us?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Like a total defense type of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Total defense gives you like a plus four AC or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** Yeah, where you don't take any aggressive actions.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** You just get a bonus.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Total defense.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Yep.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** You defend yourself.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Plus four to armor class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:34 - 00:27:01]** little little metagame i don't think this thing's gonna come after you since you're so far away so just for the listener it's like here's and rick are in the middle of this room the creature is like at the other end of that room and dr okay is all the way back at the other door yep so that's that's equivalent of you just like stepping out and be like i'll be back later guys to be fair here's is always trying to stay away so here's yeah here's is always trying to stay away

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:24]** yeah uh okay leave it to rick uh total defense you can defend yourself as a standard action starting at the beginning of this action you get a plus four bonus to your armor class until the start of your next turn you can't combine total defense with other actions that increase your ac nor can you make attacks of opportunity while doing total defense


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Okay.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** It's pretty straightforward.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** But you can still move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** It's the standard action.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** So you can move into total defense or vice versa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** I do not wish to be aggressive.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:40]** So I'm going to just take, you know, a five foot step into the room.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** Just barely with my hands up.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** Just to be like, indicate to the creature like, mean you no harm.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Okay.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** So you took total defense.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** You stepped in.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** Long mental battle don't yeah, you don't do anything.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** It seems like the creature heard you and

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** And it doesn't seem like they're going to pause yet, but it's only the top of round one.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** I like the initiative and the thought.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Here's what he's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:12]** Here's is going to... Actually, this is probably the time where it's useful.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Delay in action.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:19]** Or delay until after the creature has his move.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Okay.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Because I don't want to do something... Actually, no.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** That.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:23]** Hold on.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Actually, yes.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Do that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:53]** i don't want to attack it if it's gonna like stand down okay i just think it's gonna charge and kill us all i'm not sure if i'm using this the right way i've never done this before but i'm trying so wait so so what are you doing all right so i've never done this i'm not sure if this is the reason why but i feel like it might be wise to here's have something in mind to do if we need to kill this thing or whatever he wants there's two options wait you can you can delay your turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Right.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** I'm trying to find it in the book, too, so I don't get the quotes wrong.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** Or you can do a ready in action.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:04]** But readying in action takes a standard action.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** So you...

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** But both of them move you in initiative order.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:17]** So you're basically giving up this turn and moving back to whatever level or initiative order you're asking.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** So delay.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:26]** If you aren't sure what to do when it's your turn, you can delay taking an action until another character has taken their turn.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:33]** So you can wait until the creature's next turn, but then the creature's next turn is the first in order, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Or was that a surprise round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** There was no surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** So it definitely went before you.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** So delaying would just put you back to the end of our initiative order?

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Because then the creature goes again at the first round.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** So you don't have a turn to determine what this creature is going to do, if that makes sense.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** All right, thank you.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** But you could ready an action, which would do a trigger.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** So if the creature was to attack, you could then respond.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Yeah, got it.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** Okay, well, that's... Yeah, I know that.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** I'll do that, too.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:08]** Well, no, I did want to do the thing that Kevin was describing with the lane, but you're right because of the way that we're ordered, it doesn't make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:30]** But you could also take an action like total defense, or there's a couple other ones that you could do where it gives you a bonus AC or you distract from somebody or whatever the case is, and that would be your standard action that is not necessarily an aggressive movement, if that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:48]** okay so total action gives you plus four so yeah so what's it gonna be okay so if i if i um ready in action then that's all i can do basically i can't even do checks right like you can move and then ready in action writing action is a standard action yeah so i can't do like life science


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** I think we said license would be a standard action, right?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I can't remember.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** Was that a free action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** No, because Dr. Oki's been doing it for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Sorry.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Sorry, we need to put it on our list.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** So, yeah, you could still do a license check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Only your list, John.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** The rest of us know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Okay, great.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** I'm happy to put it on my list next to all the other things that I have to remember, Kev.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** I'm just going to do two things.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** He's going to roll life science, which he did, and he got a 27 for that.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Okay.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:21]** And then he's going to, if this creature attacks, he will supercharge Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Or becomes aggressive and supercharge Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** Question, would that be considered a purely defensive move?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:38]** Yeah, I don't know if you can... Just because in this case of ready to action, if your ready to action is purely defensive, such as choosing total defense, then you go before the triggered event.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** If it's not purely defensive, then it goes after the triggering event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Yeah, I feel like that's not defensive.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** To charge Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** I'm just... Debatable.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** He didn't actually, like... He wasn't aggressive.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** It's like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Yeah.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** I guess he's not purely defensive.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Yeah.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Technically.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Yeah.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** The gun is the aggressor here.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Arguably, it could be defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** It's defensive for Kelly.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Yes.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:07]** Like, here's defending himself by charging Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** Well, the best defense is an offense, right?

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Right.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** So there we go.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** That's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** You're totally right.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:19]** No, so I would say if you're going to ready an action, doing that will not put you before the creature's trigger.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:19]** That's fine.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:27]** Okay, so you're ready in action to supercharge your weapon after the trigger if the creature attacks.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** Otherwise, you're going to do... And you're also doing a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Yes, yes, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Yes, yes, yes.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** 27 on the life science check.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** You are very confident...

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:46]** That this is a Ekeshti, and it's an Ekeshti Rivener.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Rivener.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Yeah.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:52]** So, again, little update if you don't recall.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** I think we talked about it before.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:58]** The Ekeshti are a hardy lizard folk race native to the deserts and hills of Akiton.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:02]** And when they are born, they are these, like, ravenous animals.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:07]** Creatures that just are barely learning the rudiments of like speech and skills and social skills.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** And then they're taught by these creatures called broodminders.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:17]** And then from about five to 20 years of age, they are living their life, learning, doing everything.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** And then they enter a period where they like die.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:47]** kind of devolve or go into a rut and until they mate then they are in a state of like aggression and violence and they're like feral they're feral acestus yeah yeah and like pretty single-minded they have to mate and what i love that i don't think i mentioned last time was when they find a willing partner they mate they lay and fertilize eggs then the two mates fight each other to the death if

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:53]** If the male survives, the male becomes a broodminder who then would look after other young Akesti.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:57]** If the female is victorious, she becomes a congregant.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** And the thing is that riveners occur when the Akesti don't find a mate.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:08]** And they stay in this very feral state pretty much for the rest of their lives.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** So it's weird.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** And this is what you notice.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:16]** It's weird that it's an Akeshi Rivener, but it can speak so well.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:21]** And it's so fluid in its movements and seems like so well-trained.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Kind of odd.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** What else do you want to know besides that in terms of mechanics?

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:29]** You're looking for, like, weaknesses or immunities?

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** Weaknesses.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Yeah.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Okay.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** I'm just going to tell you right now, there are none of either.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:36]** No weaknesses?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** Yeah, no weaknesses, but also no immunities or damage resistance or anything like that.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** I will say that... It's an all-out fight.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:52]** ...that, again, the words that it said to... Originally, we're an Akatonian that Dr. K and Rick understood.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:57]** When it opened its eyes and saw you, it spoke in common.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:04]** Again, odd, because Riveners shouldn't... Technically, they don't have that level of intelligence...

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:30]** like according to evolution and biologically that doesn't make sense got you thank you that was i i tried to give you the whole kit and caboodle because you yeah you did rolled really high with life science so that was very generous here's uh we'll just shout that to uh to the group let them know the whole thing hey guys real quick hey guys like here's three things yeah um and he tells them basically


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Okay.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** So, yeah, it's kind of weird that it's so intelligent.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** It can speak.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** They're not supposed to be that way.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** He's not weak to anything.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** He's not buffed against anything.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** So keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** And you are readying in action in case it attacks.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** End of round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:52 - 00:36:11]** So Rick is standing side by side with Hears, and he kind of sees his hand glowing with the supercharge, but he's convinced that we can talk this thing down, so he's going to take a step forward to put himself between Hears and this Rivener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:17]** I'm going to do total defense to give myself a plus four to AC.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** Okay.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** And then I'm going to try a diplomacy check.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Okay.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** My diplomacy is not very high.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** I will assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Yeah.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:30]** Whoever's going to assist, give me your roll and also give me the phrase that you're going to say.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** And you can all assist.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** It's totally fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Come on.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** Roll a crit.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Let this dice roll high.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Fifteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Fifteen.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** Okay, so let's go with first, Dr. Okay, you rolled a 15.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** What do you say?

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:53]** As you see Rick just kind of summon all of his resolve, step towards this hulking creature, and you realize Rick's about to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Be like, hey, listen to us.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:01]** My friend Rick over here, he's been experimented on, too.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** We all have.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** It's okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** He rolled a 17, and he says, dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** I've met some of Keshti.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:17]** I feel really sorry for what you all have to go through.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** I'm sorry you had to do this.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** We're here to help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** I love it.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Technically, that's a lie, so you might have to bluff as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Oh, are you?

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** You've never met a Keshi?

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Because I was about to ask.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Wait, when did you meet him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** You haven't met a Keshi?

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:37]** That feels like a bluff check, so give me a quick bluff and don't totally fail it.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Don't totally fail it, because if you do, that would be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** I didn't totally fail it.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** What'd you get?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I got a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:45 - 00:38:10]** total oh yeah total is five but it's not a total fail right uh all right so i'm gonna say it's a plus one instead of a plus two from kelly because uh from here's it's a feral so their their buff is under like or their perception or whatever but again weird that it's so it's so intelligent yeah it's so coherent all right so rick what do you say

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** And what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:14]** I rolled a 15, which is actually pretty good for me most of the time.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Yep.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** And I have a plus three to diplomacy.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Okay.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** So then you can add the pluses from the other guys.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** That's a 21.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Okay.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** But again, he's stepping forward.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** His gun is lowered.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** And he's going to look this thing in the face.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:33]** And in Akatonian, tell him, I long for our home planet as well.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** I can help you get back there.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** And we can find you a mate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Nice.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** And we're giving him everything.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Dang.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Dang.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** You want to do anything else for your turn, Rick?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** So you took total offense and then you say this?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Yeah, that's my fault.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** That's my fault.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Actually, no.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** You could do a culture check if you wanted to try and surmise more in addition to life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Sure.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** So Rick is actually from Akaton, and so he knows these.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** Also, Kevin knows these a little bit from doing some research of his own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Some research of his own, a.k.a.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** reading the book, as you should do.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** You should all do it.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:34]** uh i rolled an 11 for culture with a plus 2 so 13 13 yeah i mean you don't you don't know anything else or you know the same thing as pretty much what uh uh here's had said although as as here's we're talking you're like that's right i do recall some of these things you do remember that i'll say that for instance that a catch the uh riveners are often like sometimes hunted

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:46]** Because they're kind of seen as like a bane on their own society, like an embarrassment because they can cause so much damage and act so mindlessly.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:55]** So again, this creature is clearly like hitting itself, has something going on, but then also is able to speak with you and talk to you.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** So odd.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** So you don't know too much, but you remember a little more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, that's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** Okay.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** It's the top of round two.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** And you see, as each of you... Bernice move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** What does Bernice do?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:18]** Bernice is completely still trying to be an inanimate object.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** I'm just a briefcase.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** You're normally slightly shivering.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Why is that briefcase shaking?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:28]** There's a little fluid leaks out of the bottom of Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Amazing.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** I love Bernice.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Bernice is a fan favorite.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** And by fan, I mean just all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:43]** I just want to point out, we corrected you and said you couldn't have a nanobot cloud, but Bernice is so much more fun than a nanobot cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Bernice is a briefcase.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** It's so great.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** It's so great.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:54]** All right, so it's the top of round two, and it is this Akeshji's turn.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:57]** And first it was Dr. O'K and Rick and here supporting.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:13]** And then it was Rick and Dr. O'K and here's supporting with these awesome diplomacy checks and these statements of, of, of help and finding help and being there and supporting and taking out the people who did this to you, as here said.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:19]** And you can see a sense of like confusion across the Keshi's face.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** And then, uh,

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:46]** hits itself on the head with one hand and hits itself on the other side with this other head and then it it Steps up to Rick moving faster than you would think a creature of that size should and it reaches its arm out Oh my god Rick and then it it freezes like right in front of your chest and the arm is shaking and then There's just pause


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** And it says, how do I know?

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** How do I know that I can trust you?

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:03]** How do I know that I can trust you and that you're not going to put me back in that cage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** And like its claws are like inches from your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** Are we still in initiative order?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:15]** I'm going to say for right now that you are, and I changed the music, but it depends on what Rick says.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** It depends on how this goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** We, too, are stuck in cages.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** We are reaching for an escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:33]** This whole place is full of cages for people and creatures like you and I. The creature looks at Dr. Okay, like focuses in.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:39]** We must break free of this place together if we ever want to see the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Were you in pain?

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:48]** Or where did you experience the pain of being in that cage?

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** Dr. O'Keefe, you start walking closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** In a sense.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** We've all been given different cages.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** Here.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Different kinds.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** We have been.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:07]** I can think of many torturous things we've, and horrors we've experienced, but we must get out of here.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** We must put an end to this madness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** They've been playing with us.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** They've been tricking us and trapping us in various places.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** We understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Hits itself.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** And then just the claw drops out from in front of Rick's face.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** And it's not going to attack you.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** And it just falls to the ground.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:36]** And there's a vibration as everything that's on the ground almost comes up a little bit.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:40]** Because this huge creature leaves more cracks in the floor.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:44]** And it just... I just want it to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Just kill me.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Just do it.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Just make it stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** Doctor, can you do anything to help him?

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:01]** Can I do a medicine check and see if he's under any particular afflictions?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:09]** And I would ask for his permission, like, can I help alleviate some of this, perhaps?

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** May I take a look at you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:30]** rick puts a hand on his shoulder and says it's okay to walk away here's the arm like it like like pushes you and you stumble a few feet back from the shoulder because it's just the shoulder is like the size of your chest you know it's just this huge creature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** I'm kidding.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** Rick did not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:39]** You still stumble back just from the idea of doing that and the terror that would happen if it moved back.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** What does here's do?

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:49]** Here's is going to close his eyes and put his hand up and going to try to detect any magical afflictions or traps on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Things like that.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** Hears you don't detect anything, but the creature looks at you, and Dr.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:01]** O.K., it sees he's casting something, and then... What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** And then turns to Dr. O.K.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Stay back.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** I don't.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** I don't.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:17]** If you don't consent, I won't examine you, but I can, you know, can I just do, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:21]** Like an observation kind of check?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Yeah.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Or like a quick scan?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Yeah, sure, of course.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Yeah, yeah, of course.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** Kind of without the creature knowing, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Yeah.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** Not without violating his, like, personal space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** Yeah, which is enlarged.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Or his HIPAA rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** I can't give you that information for HIPAA purposes.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** That's what it says.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** What is your role, Dr. King?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** Please, uh...

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Hold on.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:48]** I dropped my die, and I've been looking for it, and I can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Yeah, find it.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Give me one second.

**[00:45:50 - 00:46:04]** As you're finding it, I will tell you that as you're kind of maybe fumbling around for your equipment, because you're thinking, all right, I'm going to kind of stealthily do this, the creature says, there's no way to cure this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** No way to cure this.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:12]** What I am, and I didn't think I'd be this way.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** I didn't think so.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:22]** I knew that I'd pass the age to be a Riveter, and I'm damned.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:27]** My fate is sealed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** What'd you roll?

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Yeah, so I rolled... What am I rolling?

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Medicine?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Yeah.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** Okay, I'll roll to assist.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** Maybe you just look over at Dr. Zakai's readings.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** I rolled a 25.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** Roll 13 on the die, plus 12.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** And I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** Okay.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** I'm not trained, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:51]** I will say that you know that...

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:57]** Again, he is definitely, or they are definitely a Rivener.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:05]** They don't seem to have anything, like, going on from, you know, uh...

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** They don't seem to have any, like, ailments.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** They just seem like all their biology points to the fact that they're an Achilles' heel ribboner.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:21]** You rolled so high that you do notice that there's probably a possible cortex bomb or something in the back of their head.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** They don't know this.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** They aren't scratching or doing anything.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:30]** And again, it does seem like you would need to do a little bit more.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:34]** But you think that something about them must have been altered.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** And you would need to get their blood or get something to know more about it.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:43]** But it doesn't make sense that the Rivener... Yeah, I assume they've been, like, engineered.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Yeah, like, just changed somehow.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:54]** Not sure how, but, like, a Rivener shouldn't be able to talk this coherently and sit down and express their emotions and their fate and their despair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Maybe it's some sort of chimera.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** It's just still, like, just sitting.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** Hits itself occasionally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Take a second and understand.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:15]** You know that you should be a Rivener, but you are more aware than that, which makes you different, and that is okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** You have been altered.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:24]** I was a gladiator, and I was damn good at it, too.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:29]** I used to crush beings into one.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:37]** I used to rip apart my enemies, throw their bodies at other enemies because I was damn good at it.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** So why am I a Rivener?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** I was not a Rivener before.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** So why am I a Rivener now?

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:52]** I'm hideous.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Just kill me.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** Did the greys, did the greys do this to you?

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** No, don't say their name.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:07]** And you can tell that they're having like a flashback of pain.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:19]** He's remembering that he has, he's ready to supercharge a weapon in the back of his head with all this going on.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** And knowing about this history of this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:26]** If I can examine you, perhaps I can end this misery you are in.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** Let us help you as much as we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** And then just this massive arm just, like, comes in front of you.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** It, like, easily covers the distance between Dr. Okay and Rick.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** And you're able to, I guess, draw a sample.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Yeah?

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Yeah.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Take his blood pressure.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** Take his vitals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Yep.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:59]** I would like also to take a look at his genetic makeup.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** That's what I was thinking.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Yeah.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** Give me another roll.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:11]** Which I have a scholarly granted option in genetics.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Nice.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** So I should have a reduced DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:20]** On Hero Lab, that should be in the top right hand under your special abilities, I believe.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Under a theme knowledge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** PhD in genetics, life science.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** Thank you, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** What'd you roll?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:36]** I rolled a 16 plus... What are we doing?

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** Life science or medicine?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:42]** Whichever one you want to do.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Let's do life science.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Plus 13.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** Rick will attempt to assist you.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Uh, a cyst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:56]** Okay, so Rick, maybe you point out a marker and Dr. K is like, I just point out where the vein is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** He has a cyst also.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** It's like right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Okay, so 31.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:06]** It does seem like this creature has always been a Rivener.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:12]** So it's weird that this creature has a memory of not being a Rivener.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** It's brain's been like swapped.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** The genetics would indicate that it's always been a Rivener

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:40]** But clearly there are foreign parts of the genetic makeup that must have been injected or added in later to try and adjust change that might explain why this creature has such a cognitive ability that even though they're a Rivener, they can speak so well and move so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** By Aureus, you've changed.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** What is your name?

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Do you have one?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** Yes, my name is Frank.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** You are the first of your kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** You're amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** You're so special and smart and strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:11]** Yes, you've been irrevocably changed inside and altered.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Give me a culture check.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** Ten on the die plus ten is twenty.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** 19.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** That's 21.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Kev, do you assist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** I feel like you would automatically because you know Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:34]** Well, that and Rick is just going to tell him like, I completely understand what it means to feel like you are in the wrong body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** You recall that frog...

**[00:52:39 - 00:53:01]** is the name of a gladiator and a kesty gladiator who was on a minor show sorry hey they were a minor star in this popular akitonian hollow series that was called akiton's arena warriors

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:08]** And Rick, you already know this, but I'm sure Dr. K in here is like, Akiton is the place to go for gladiatorial combat.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:12]** It is part of the culture for thousands and thousands of years.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** So it makes sense that there's a TV show that involves gladiators.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:21]** The weird thing, though, is that Hrog disappeared about four years ago.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:31]** In an incident that some people, tabloids, just labeled as related to maybe organized crime, some insider gambling.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:35]** They were no longer on the show after a mid-season break.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** So, weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Are you...

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** I know your name.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** I remember watching you on my television as a child.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** You know me?

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** You are the great gladiator, Harag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:52 - 00:54:06]** Yeah, that's right, but all I was... The eyes kind of look up, and it's such a total difference from when they first opened, and there was so much anger and fear and confusion, and now it's sitting on the ground, which is pretty much eye-height for you all.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** And there's just such confusion, but also like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:27]** compassion suddenly and then a little bit of like hope talking to you yeah that's me i'm rogue i was the best and then now i'm here now i'm now i'm cursed riven up

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:34]** I understand I might be special, but I don't deserve it.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** You know what happens to Riven is right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** I have been told.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** I have heard the stories.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** It is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** I'm cursed.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** I'm cursed.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:54]** I don't know why you're here, but just leave me.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** We should all leave together.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Maybe we can help each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** Sorry, I don't want to break all the roleplay.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** This is fantastic, but it just reminds me of Fallout.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** The deathclaws.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:16]** That's a great... And if anybody's ever played, I think it was Fallout 2, you can actually befriend a deathclaw that wears...

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:36]** because it's a death claw like people are afraid of them so he would just like wear a cloak and so it just looked like a hunchback that's funny but it was underneath whenever you got to a fight it would drop its robes and then just like claw the thing yeah so yeah we're let's just hand this thing a cloak why don't we just yeah we should carry the knife fiber neck i'm sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:39]** He could carry Bernice around when she doesn't want to walk on her own feet.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:47]** Hrog, why don't you stay here?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** And if we can find a way out, I can promise we will come back for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:54]** No, you can help us fight our way out of here and avenge you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:54 - 00:56:20]** that too but i'm afraid to like have this thing behind us glory of your gladiatorial days you could be a new new creation should have been to fight all the stewards here's here's wants to know if we can maybe a sense motive to rely rely if we can rely on him not like turning again it's a it's not high it's a seven but if anyone else wants to roll you're welcome to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** I'll try to roll to assist, maybe?

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** What is this, Sense Motors?

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Sense Motors.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Yeah, I got a minus one.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** I automatic.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Ooh, I help.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Sorry.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Yeah, I totally assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** What's the total?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Okay, so 11 points then.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** Jesus.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** You rolled an 11?

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** I have no idea.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Seven plus their assist, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** It's not that great.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** You are... They are unstable.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Frog is unstable, for sure.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Frog definitely...

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** could probably be relied on.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** As if this is actually Harad?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Seems like it.

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:01]** You were able to talk them down with some really targeted, compassionate phrases.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** OK, cool.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:06]** How much they'll follow through, I don't know, because they are unstable.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** So their decisions could change in an instant.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:17]** Are they going to turn against you now that you've talked to them and they've let you do a medicine check and everything?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Probably not.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** Will they help you?

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** You'll have to find out.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Will they stay in the fight or leave?

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** That's the question.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** That's what you don't know with your sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:48]** cool anything else here's here's is going to uh is gonna like kind of like look at him and like smile a nice grin and he's gonna be like you want to rip some other arms off and come with us let's take them out and get you out of here with us i do like ripping arms off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:55]** Rick's going to try another diplomacy check, because diplomacy works on a ladder scale, right?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Yeah, true.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** And I'm looking through... Change of attitude, basically.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Yeah.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:05]** Initial attitude, and then there's a hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:12]** So the more diplomacy checks we can pass on this creature, the more likely they are to at least stay friendly to us.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** So Rick is going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** Yeah, within reason.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** It's not going to be like you just keep talking and talking and it'll totally happen.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** No, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Keep talking and talking, John.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Stop it.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Just make rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:23]** Yeah.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** All right.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Roll over and over again.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Make your roll and say what you say.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** We can get back into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** I rolled a 19 and I have a plus three, so that's a 22.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** What do you say?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** And Rick is very calm and he almost whispers it to him in Akatonian.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** You were my father's favorite gladiator ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Really?

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Yes.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** I'm going to go and watch some reruns of your fights.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** After this.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** I've got a good playlist I can give to you.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Oh, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Bernice, pull it up on the projector.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** The smell of popcorn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** A popcorn machine that is also a projector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:08]** The rest of the adventure is just the four of us sitting in this room watching the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** Rip his arms off.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** So good to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Munch, munch, munch.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** You asked me if I wanted to fight?

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Yes.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:24]** I could fight.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** What's in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** What's in there?

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Do you know?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** And Hrog points to the left to the room down here.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** There are strange bugs in there.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:42]** They reminded me of the swarm, whatever they were doing in there.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:46]** Trying to change the outcome of the swarm.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** But I heard their screams and their pain.

**[00:59:53 - 01:00:01]** The same pain that no one should have to have that pain again.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]** So I can end their suffering.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** I can do that.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** I can fight for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** There's also this worm thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Do you say something else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** I think Rick almost feels compassion for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:25]** We've got to get to the reactor before we're all just become slaves to these greys.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:32]** But Rick will tell him, like, if you think that is the right thing to do, we are not going to stop you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** I want to end it for them.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** And I'll help you.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** But if you're going to the reactor...

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]** There is something down there.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]** And like, there's just a gravity in their voice.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** There's a creature.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** There's a beast.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:00]** There's an infernal beast that moves without walking.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:08]** And I have literally ripped Riveners in half and crushed them with one hand.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:14]** But that creature, that beast is unlike anything I've fought before.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** I fought it.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Would you?

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** He smashed me through that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:23]** He points to the door behind you and the door that he's like sitting on right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:28]** He smashed me through both of those doors and death comes for every gladiator.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** And I thought, today is my day.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:38]** But as soon as that door came down, that thing sniffed.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** And then it moved without walking.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** And I heard something over there.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:48]** And it points to the right, to the north of where you are.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** I heard some metal rip.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** And there was a silence.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** And it was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:23]** troll with his two heads and arms that thing could kill me i can't i can't fight that thing but together we can tame it or destroy it that infernal creature we're pretty strong we can help we can together defeat it and we can get you out of here so you can be free


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:27]** And Rick puts his hand out and is like, let's do this together.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Give me another diplomacy check.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]** I mean, like, put his hand out for, like, everybody put their hands on top of his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** We just need a small beagle with us.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** I got a natural 20 on my diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** I will assist with an 11.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** Here's assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:49]** Okay, so 24 total, right?

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** We're so good.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** Yeah.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Are we?

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** 25, aren't we?

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** We are.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** We're good at this.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** Oh, 25 with Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** Yep.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** All right.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Maybe.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** Maybe.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:04]** But if I help you, we got to help them.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** Those bugs.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** Because they shouldn't suffer.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:12]** Not like I have.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Okay.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:15]** That's the only way that I'll help.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** I agree.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Let's do it.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:18]** I think so.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** He looks at the end of the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:24]** So just so we're clear, we're killing these bugs or are we helping these bugs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** Oh, I think those bugs are long past.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** I don't think they have what I have.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:33]** I don't think they can talk.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** They're too far gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** You didn't say there were bugs.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** You said it was a figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** There's a figure in there also, is there?

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:41]** That's what I said when you guys were in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:44]** So these bugs are like swarming into the shape of something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:50]** When you all first went in there, I said there was a figure.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:54]** Now, the frog has said they were doing something in there.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]** There are strange bugs in there that reminded me of the swarm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** I don't like this at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:07]** That they were clearly experimenting on them because they're experimenting on Hrog and they're experimenting on the bugs.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** That's the only way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:18]** Otherwise, maybe if we live, if we survive, then I'll join you and we can get out.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** How many are there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** I don't know.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:25]** There were four in there, but I can't remember.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** It's all blurry.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** I don't know what happened to them.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]** Maybe one, maybe two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Maybe one or two left.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Are they strong?

**[01:04:38 - 01:05:08]** and when you all went in there you only saw one figure it was dimly lit and you did see that there were other test tubes but you saw maybe like other figures that like you couldn't really tell like they probably weren't moving so it's like there's probably only one I don't know if they're strong if they've lived through what I've lived through then maybe they're stronger but yes we will support you in this combat let us prepare I will take a stance at that other door and we can get them from multiple sides okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** And I'm going to slamming its head.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** No offense to this creature, but I don't even know if he can fit through those doors.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** So he's a large creature.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** Smash down that giant two way glass.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** That's what you should do.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:28]** Are you ready?

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** Is everyone ready?

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Give me a second.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:39]** And Rick starts walking or he charges back to the other doors and he's going to take a stance at this door here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** You want to flank him?

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:46]** He's just going to wait for a loud noise to kick the door open and start shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:50]** Here's is going to go to the other door on there and flank them.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:53]** So we're all three doors now surrounding them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:53]** Yeah.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** Dr. Oki, you hang out near the giant lizard thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:59]** This is my briefcase, Bernice.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:02]** Is that cool if I just hang out with Bernice here?

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** Not gonna bother you.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** You're cool with robots, right?

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Cool, man.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** Hey, do you need something to relax?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** Just give him to relax you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** How do you feel, dude?

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** You're the best gladiator ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** It's like a crown.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** I'm fine.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:27]** I'm dead with wrist and this and them f***ing rings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** Alright, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:28]** I know what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** I believe it.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** I'm a slug.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** We're gonna have fun.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Here's shouts around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** Stay alive, guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** This is like the old times.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** This is like the ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:44]** Are we going to count down to reach or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** Yeah.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** Let's count down.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** Ready?

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Three, two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:56]** And then just rips the door open and just starts running in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:58]** Amazing.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Oh, Jesus, what just happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:03]** And as it runs in, you hear... You guys open the doors?

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** Yeah.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** We all do, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:11]** He didn't wait for us to... And then just opens the door and runs in.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** And I will tell you two things.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:27]** And one is that in the center of the room is this creature that looks like they are part of the swarm and they have these giant clawed fingers as well as this insectoid head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** What are you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:52]** doing but their body looks like they are half cybernetic and as soon as her all goes in maybe Rick you were like you would just had the door peaked you see the creature look and turn it from a from a state of complete stasis turns and looks at frog and then frog just shouts let's kill them and that's our game

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** That's the best ending ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:59]** That was the most intense conversation I have ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:03]** I'm so happy we're helping fulfill this guy's dream, by the way.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:06]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:11]** This monster was going to tear us apart, and now it's going to tear our next monster apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** Our fans hate us.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:15]** He's like, you guys never fight anything.
