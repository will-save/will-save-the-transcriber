## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously, on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:12]** Having handled the Toshitari, our heroes hasten down the hallway in search of a way down to the reactor, but not before taking a long rest, of course.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:27]** While moving through the hallway, the doctor noticed some anomalous levels of radiation from a door our heroes valiantly avoid, only to stop in a long hallway lined with alcoves containing boxes full of personal effects and small objects.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:28]** for our crew to scavenge through.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:34]** Among them, a curious binder clip looking item, an olfactory nose.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:43]** So curious, in fact, that without a second thought, the doctor places the foreign object on his own nose.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:47]** Will our crew be able to sniff out the reactor in time?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:52]** Or are they about to find out what happens when you stick your nose where it doesn't belong?

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:47 - 00:02:00]** Now, I might be showing my age with this one, but I have realized lately the benefit of a certain article of clothing.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** And before I tell you what, I'm going to tell you a little story.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:11]** I'm at your local, friendly neighborhood bookstore.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:15]** Let's call it Karns and Roble.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Not the last bookstore?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:23]** Not the last bookstore, which would have been great to go to, but we were out in Agura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:27]** I thought that you preferred Quarters or that one bookstore instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Oh, Quarters?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Yeah.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Didn't Quarters go out of business?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Yeah.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** All bookstores are going out of business.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:38]** Luxe A Billion, the one that rhymes with Luxe A Billion, they also went out of business.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** Ah, man, I used to spend so much money at that place.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Me too.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:45]** I went there for all the Pokemon games on Saturday and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** I was just dumb.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:51]** I was like, I'm going to read all these books, and I would buy literally ten books, and then I'd only ever read one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** But now you're on your crusade to take that back.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** That's right, and I still have all those books.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** Kev is taking his literacy back.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** He's very well read these days.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Yeah.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:13]** Okay, so I'm in Carnes and Roble, and I'm standing in an aisle, perusing the shelves, and I hear these two dudes walking by, and they're like...

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Right.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** And then as they pass me, I hear what they're saying.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:29]** And this one dude so emphatically and like with such a disappointed tone in his voice, he's like, and he didn't even have socks on.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** And then they pass the shelf.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Wait.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** And I was like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** Why didn't... What's wrong with not having socks on?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** This is a deep conversation, man.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** I don't know if we're ready for it.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:45]** First of all, socks with sandals is wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** I don't know if he was wearing sandals, but I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:52]** Unless, and there's, like, few occasions where it's okay.

**[00:03:52 - 00:04:08]** Like, if you're a soccer player or some other, you know, kind of thing where you have to wear cleats, then it's okay to have, like, you know, the, like, one strap sandal because you can, like, take your cleats off and put those on and walk off the field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** But other than that, if you're wearing socks and sandals, you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Or if you live in Germany.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** I would call those a slipper, personally.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** A slipper is good.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** A slipper could be worn with socks.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** But would you wear a slipper outside?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** There are people that do that.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Typically, no.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** I'm not that kind of gentleman, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** Could you call such a person a gentleman?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:44]** But we're talking about the whole opposite side of the spectrum where people are wearing no socks, I'm assuming, and just shoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Oh, but that's the thing, though.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:51]** Like loafers with the hem of your pants rolled up, no socks.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** I've done that.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:57]** Why did he say and he didn't have socks on?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** What was the situation?

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** We'll never know.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** So that's what you overheard.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** That's what I overheard.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** And he didn't have socks on.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:10]** And then it just got me thinking like how great socks are to society and how much I love wearing them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Do you guys want to posit some ideas as to what he was talking about?

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Sure.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** I mean, like maybe it was a business meeting and then the guy didn't have socks or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Well, if he's wearing loafers, according to John, it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** Well, I agree.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Sort of.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** If you're in a Mediterranean climate, perhaps.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** If you came from your yacht.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** Maybe I have an idea what it might have been.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** What's your idea?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:54]** A lot of open houses these days, they want you to take off your shoes and walk through with paper booties, but sometimes people are like, I'm wearing these booties because I'm too manly.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** You'll never catch me in these booties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** I'd rather take my shoes off than put the little booties over my shoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** I actually am a shoes-off house, personally.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Yeah, so are we.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:30]** i don't think like another this is sort of related but like you realize when you wear shoes in your house like all the you stepped on throughout your entire day is everywhere all over your floor yeah taking your shoes off in the front door is a good thing yeah yeah i don't have like house slippers though i've never been able to get into that yeah it's because i have bedtime slippers those sound like that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** Just going around like Ebenezer Scrooge at night with like a fucking candle.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Do you also wear a candle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** Do you have like a little candle light as you walk down the hall?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:43]** As soon as we leave Will's house, he's just like... And then just like crumbles to death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Yeah.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** It's great.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** Grayson has a pair of house slippers.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** They have a Velcro strap, but it's a little fox on it because his grandma bought them for him.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** He'll bring them to us and we'll put them on his feet and then he takes them right off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** That defeats the purpose of wearing them.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** You know what you could wear?

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** Socks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** He also wears socks.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** He doesn't like socks as well.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** I'll pull those off too.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:33]** children they just don't understand socks are important socks are very important dry feet taking care of your feet and self-care is important yeah i'll admit though i yeah i was definitely especially when i lived in california like i was a flip-flop person for the most part especially in the summers so like most of my life they were definitely like like weeks at a time that i did not wear any socks at all yeah i mean i've never gotten into flip-flops


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:50]** where now it's the opposite i'm always wearing socks yeah because we live in a place that snows it's cold it's cold it's cold i mean i think the space between my my big toe and my second toe is bigger because i just grew up in florida wait did you say your toes and mine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Yeah, well, it's your heart and mine.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Isn't that Dave Matthews or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** I think it's better with your toes and mine.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** I don't know what that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:04]** I picture two feet, like, people putting their... Two feet closing a heart for Valentine's Day.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** Yeah, happy Valentine's Day, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** I feel like a lot of listeners right now are really grossed out because we were talking about feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:14]** And now is where John's going to get into how bad Kevin hates holidays in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Oh, no, that's next week.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** It's fine.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Oh, okay.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Yeah, don't worry.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** You've got a week to prepare your response about how Kevin doesn't like holidays.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Really?

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yeah, he doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** But I just don't care about holidays.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** Hold that for next week.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Hold that for next week.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I have burning questions.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** Find out next time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** On We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:36]** Your whole intro is like, Kevin's going to complain about holidays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Let's hear Kevin complain about holidays.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** You're going to go last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Do you hate holidays?

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** Find out now how much Kevin is right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** I do enjoy Kevin's rants.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** I feel like you should.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** They're real good.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** I want to hear it go off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:55]** Alright, should we play?

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Yeah.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** Here we go.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** I want to know what happens to Dr. O.K.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** Us play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:08]** I'm curious what this olfactory substance olfactory is.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Is that what it is?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** What was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** It's old factory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** No, it's old factory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:16]** It's called the olfactory nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Super smell!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:21]** Us go to

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** A recap.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Lights down.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** The pressure is on.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:55]** As the three of you realize that your path forward has become clear, disrupt the sanitation process of the reactors in order to unlock the doors to the only way off of whatever this may be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** Screw it!

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** There's only one reactor?

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** No, there's two.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** But remember, Shay's team is going to the other one.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** You're going to the... Okay, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:13]** I know I just derailed everything, but I have to bring this up.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:18]** This guy knocked on our door and he was trying to sell us some kind of like... No, I don't know.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:26]** He was trying to tell us some kind of like solar farm subscription or something.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** Okay.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:31]** I didn't get to hear his whole speech, but at some point he was like, we're trying to reduce fossil fuels and nuclear power.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** And I was like, wait a minute.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** Shut the door.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Well, I was about to argue with him and then Lauren shut the door.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** Say that one more time.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Say what?

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Nuclear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Do you hate nuclear power?

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** Find out why you're wrong next week.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Oh, I will tell you why you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** That poor guy didn't get to hear a Kevin Rantz.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** I almost went and hunted him down.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** I'll put on my jacket.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Cut.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** Cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Wait a minute.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** Let's go back to the recap before Kevin goes on.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I'm not freaking Bill Wood.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** There's two more hands.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** There's two more hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:12]** And C, repeat what you were saying about two reactors versus one.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** One team, Shay's team, is going to one reactor.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** You're going to the other one.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:24]** Let me take a sip.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** So you guys take a rest.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** And you begin looking for the way out.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:44]** to the reactor, down one of two corridors yet unexplored, only to discover the resting quarters of the gray staff.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:56]** And now there are small white pearly pods with this energy, and you think maybe that's where they could regenerate, kind of like rejuvenate, rest.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:06]** There are these broken devices that you surmise are likely some sort of transport, teleport device.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:14]** And there are also these floating colorful boxes that I put on our landing page that all hold...

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:20]** of strange assortment of knickknacks and paraphernalia.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:33]** You find a couple of interesting things, starting with this gambling tool that looks like maybe a spindle with seven sides that Rick recognizes immediately.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** I have the Yosuke numbers written on them.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:46]** There is a small, thick, seamless metal disc that Rick feels urged to touch.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:54]** And there is a coil of flexible and iridescent silk string, all 50 feet long.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:05]** And I'm just going to tell you right now, that thing has AC 11, hardness 1, 10 damage to cut or break, and it's immune to cold, acid, and electricity.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** Pretty random knick-knack.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** But then among that, you also find weird little things like earrings and a ring.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Maybe lotion.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:24]** Strange things that seem like they're personal belongings from all over the packed worlds near space and beyond.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Then...

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Dr.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:32]** O.K., you discover this clip that says the olfactory knows.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Ye old factory.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** The old factory.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Ye old factory.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** The olfactory.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** The olfactory knows.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** Olfactory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Olfactory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** You...

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:57]** It looks like it's meant to attach or connect to some sort of smell, maybe a taste organ, something, wherever that might be.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** I'm not sure what it does.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:09]** But as soon as you clip this on to what I would imagine would be maybe like some part of your face, I looked.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:13]** I don't know that Osiris have pronounced nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** It's near my micro lab equipment near my neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Okay.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** Your mind is flooded with sensations in your olfactory system.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** And there's this immediate...

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:50]** smell that just sinks into your head into your senses of flimflone and it reminds you of your time in university

**[00:14:52 - 00:15:01]** Snacking, walking around campus, discussing xenobiological principles, cutting-edge research.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** No, I just said join the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:19]** For about a minute, it's so true and real to life that you kind of instinctively look up and you're thinking, where are these sugary polyps?

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** It has to be right near you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Maybe it's in your bag.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Sugary-filled polyp.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Sex with juiciness.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Protein goo.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Stop making me hungry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** But as you turn your head...

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** that smell quickly.

**[00:15:41 - 00:16:09]** fowls becoming sterile and medicinal and every part of your brain screams telling you to take it off and I think without thinking you push it off and it clatters to the floor roll a fortitude save what are you thinking doctor okay so is that like memory now burned in my mind is like medicinal and like what do I I feel like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** I don't know.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** How do I feel?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:23]** I guess I would feel some sort of headache or some sort of uncomfortableness and I would try to analyze it with the micro lab.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** Probably should have done that before I tried it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** You go and you pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** I don't know if I did or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** You didn't.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** I don't think you did.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** No, you didn't analyze it with the micro lab.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** That's fine.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** But maybe you go and you pick it up right now.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Clatters off the floor.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** Again, the lights here are

**[00:16:40 - 00:17:07]** dim sometimes dark and so as it clatters you can hear just the you get an aural sense of the hallway that you're in it's a long hallway and when you grab it and pick it up put it into your micro lab maybe try and analyze it it does seem like it brings up a memory of something pleasant and great

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:12]** And if you put it on like a tasting organ, then you taste whatever it was.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** It doesn't seem like it's meant to go sour.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** That's not intended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:23]** Is it in disrepair or has it been modified in any way?

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** 17.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** You're fairly confident that it's fine.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:35]** That was nice for a moment, but something lingered.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** I don't know about this.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Some lingering aftertaste.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** Do you tell the other?

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yeah.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** I tell him about, I experienced the...

**[00:17:48 - 00:18:10]** the sensation of my home world some of my favorite treats uh to eat you know some of my fondest memories and now it's not like permanently tainted in my memory no you still think back but for some reason it's like whatever the technology was met something

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:20]** And it sampled part of me, and it recollected that... I recall that stimulus to my brain from this device.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I don't know if I like it.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:28]** I'd be careful, but... I mean, it appears no harm, no lasting harm.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:34]** Just this funky aftertaste of my... Well, my offalacteries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** Can I do a culture check on this thing?

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Sure.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Sure.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Oh, as I drop my dice.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** Hold on just a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:50]** I got a 12 plus 2 for a 14.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** A 14.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:55]** One sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:20]** oh he was not prepared for this culture check question i was not oh wait i think i have i'll try to aid in a culture check now i'll start looking at it as well i don't have i do get a minus five dc but i'm not currently tracking anybody um that's that's for my i aid here's a or i rolled a 27

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:44]** same okay so 18 right yes oh wait sorry sorry i do i do get a when attempting a culture check to recall knowledge about a location you're trying to lie low in i get a reduced dc but this doesn't apply to that right so i got 14 plus and you guys both both aided so a total of 18


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** I mean, you could roll.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** It's up to you.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** What you want to do?

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** I just got a 26 culture for myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** I think between Dr. OK and Rick.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:04]** Dr. OK, maybe you realize you're like, I know there's biotech companies that make stuff like this.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** This is very consumer friendly.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** It's really nice.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:16]** It doesn't seem like it has any purpose other than providing nice memories and senses.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:32]** And you think, the only company, the only place that I know that does this a lot, that is the main industry of this planet, is Brethina.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** Bretheda is very well known for... Also spoken, Bretheda?

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Bretheda, Bretheda.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** I prefer Bretheda, but also I prefer Bretheda.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Let's say Bretheda.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:55]** Biotech is a huge industry here, as well a bit as Leovara, which is the neighboring planet, like the neighboring little sibling.

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:01]** And one of the firms that you remember, there's a firm called Life Innovations,

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:11]** That you recall is one of the leading firms, but they are often an umbrella company to smaller companies.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:17]** And you remember one called LifeJoy, which you think that's probably where this came from.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** It's a subsidiary of Life Innovations.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:27]** They specifically make devices that are meant to elicit or bring forth innovation.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:49]** moments of pleasure or relaxing solitude fascinating you think it's probably from protheta likely from this life joy company as you think about that you realize the olfactory nose is just a pun on the nose nose oh okay

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** What a funny joke.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Life joy, where you find joy.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** That's what you do.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** All right.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** Does anyone else want to put this on?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** Nope.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** Anyone else want to see what they remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** I think we should continue.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** Yeah, here's what's finally going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** Man, the way you say that, dang it.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:14]** So, Rick, can I do, I don't know, is there like a license?

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Like, Dr. OK feels OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Yes.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** I feel fine.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Maybe it's been a minute or two.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:25]** There have been no symptoms other than for a minute you kind of had like a bad aftertaste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:33]** Do you want to experience some old factory smells?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** Well, I feel like Rick isn't talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Old olfactory smells.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Sorry, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** He's not talking about this.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:50]** And so I don't want to roll against another player, but I kind of want to roll a life science check just to see if Dr. O.K.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** was affected without even asking him openly.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Maybe that's insight.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** I don't have insight, do I?

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** I don't have insight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:20]** you don't like it's not a skill it's not sure it is sorry apologies was thinking of 5e um perception yeah and a sense motive maybe sense motive because i feel like for sense motive you can like kind of just get a sense of how people are doing

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** I'd say you can do either one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** Sense a mental effect.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:28]** You can use sense motive to ascertain whether another creature within 30 feet is affected by a mental effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:33]** If I'm under the influence of this olfactory factory thing.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Olfactory factory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** The problem is I have a negative one in sense motives.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** Might as well roll it.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** And I got a three on the dice.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** He seems fine.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** So Rick will reach down and pick it up.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Okay.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** And clip it to his nose.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:53]** Okay.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** I just want to try it.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** That's what they all say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:20]** carefully android oh rick you clip it onto your nose and once again your mind is flooded with sensation feels like you're being a little overloaded not sure why but if you had to compare you're just a stronger feeling

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:28]** And it's the first feeling you have is of the scent of spice.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:42]** And then with it becomes this delicious, scrumptious smell of like home cooking made only by those who love you and care about you.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:47]** And you're lost in this flood of memories of

**[00:24:47 - 00:25:09]** red sun bright light and you think for a second maybe you hear laughing around you before all at once the scent assaults you overloads you and forces you to kind of gag and you push it off your nose and it clatters to the ground uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:23]** I mean, after coughing and choking, Rick kind of rubs his face just a little bit because those sensations are almost otherworldly at this point in his life.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Yeah.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** And he's almost on the verge of whatever kind of tears androids have.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Wow.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:36]** But that thing is not right.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** I think we should destroy it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** Here's can't contain his curiosity, though.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** And he puts it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:53]** One day, when we stream some of these episodes, you can see the smile that came over my face.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Here's.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** You clip this.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Sheerans have noses, right?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** I feel like I looked a while back, and they definitely do.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** But now I'm going to open my thing.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:11]** Oh, by the way, I got the pocket core rulebook.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Nice.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:12]** Thanks to my sister.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** I love the pocket core rulebooks.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** They're just so handy.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Yeah, they're really handy.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Pretty sure Sheerans have.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** It looks like there's nostrils on their faces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** That's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Okay.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Yeah.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** Plus, we could breathe through our carapace, I suppose.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** That's true.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Worst case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:34]** So you put it there and you clip it onto your nostril.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Again, same thing.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:46]** Your mind flooded with sensation comes up your spine into your shoulders, through your neck and into your head.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** And you're met with a strong smell of

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:57]** Something tasty, some sort of maybe like cooked protein.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:01]** It's on the tip of your tongue.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** You're like, what is that?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** And then you realize it's castravelian water eggs.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:19]** And there's this familiar sensation of warmth and care that comes over you, comforting you for a minute.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:26]** As what I can imagine, it's comforting your on-edge psyche.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:37]** And as soon as you sink into that place as if you were practicing mindfulness, as soon as you become lost, the smell turns rotten, like rotten eggs.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:44]** And every part of your brain and your body screams you to rip it off and you throw it on the ground.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** Again, clattering to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** Hmm.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** He has just breathed a little heavily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:05]** After that happens, Rick wants to do, I don't know, can I do an engineering check on it to see if the greys had messed with this?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:13]** Because we know now that this comes from a sense of joy, that it's manufactured to be a pleasant device.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:27]** But we've already seen them with the, uh, Abador core guardian with our technology to, to enact some sort of, uh, actually I'm, I'm Rick is going to actually ask Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Like Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:35]** Do you think that the grays may have modified this device to cause unpleasant trees?

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Uh, I can roll, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Did I already roll that though?

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** You did.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:43]** And you did a good job with that engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** And they didn't show anything?

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Here's Roll.27's engineering.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Same deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:59]** Perhaps they took a sample of this and maybe they used it for some of their own later... I don't know.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:05]** They, like, borrowed from it and then learned about our olfactory and stuff.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:09]** It's not my expertise, Rick.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** I can just say that I do not trust the Greys one bit.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** I tend to agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** I guess Hears knows the same thing from his role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Yeah.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Hears knows it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:47]** love it i love it hilarious i don't think it's punishment worthy i want it to be rude yeah sorry so what do you want to do you're standing again in this hallway vibrations are occasionally coming up through the floor there are cracks that are appearing in the walls the light is dim occasionally flickering to complete darkness and then back to low light

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:53]** and you are standing in this hallway that's honestly maybe 120 feet almost.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** Three alcoves that you've explored on the east side so far.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:12]** It appears there's maybe another one up north, and there's also a large door that looks pretty heavily set at the end of the hallway, and you entered back in the southern part, and you're closer to the northern edge.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:21]** Say we explore below deck, try to find our way down.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** What do you say, guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:28]** The steward, Shay, told us it should be in the northeast direction.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** This could possibly be the way down.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** And Rick moves close enough.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** I'm going to roll perception to see if I can see any kind of indication of that ladder well.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** Okay.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** Okay.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:45]** I got a nine plus six for 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** 15.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** You don't see much indication of a ladder.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** Well, it doesn't seem like there is one because Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** You walked up further.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:21]** and you walked up to that door and let me tell you what you see at the door and then i'll reveal what you see to your right oh god let me pull all three books that i have on my lap off my lap so then i can get to where i want to go i'm not dead guys no in the meantime pierce picks up the the olfactory nose or whatever and takes it with him and follows amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:26]** Is that somewhere on the, could you add it to your inventory on Hero Lab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** I will make a note to do that.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** I've actually been trying to think about that because I want to find a way to give you guys equipment.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** And we have an equipment sheet, all you listeners.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:41]** That's a separate Google sheet, but it would be nice to have another one that was easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** John tried to implement and nobody else touches.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Yeah, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** It was more for you all just in case.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** I know.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** But I don't really care whether you guys use it or not.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:55]** I just thought it would be nice to have, like, an equipment, I don't know, sheet.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** Dr. O'Kays, you walk up.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:01]** Give me a, oh, man.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:05]** Give me an engineering check at this door as you and Bernice walk up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:10]** I Yahtzee 19 on the die.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** I Yahtzee 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** I Yahtzee 30.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** 30.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Okay.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:30]** You are fairly certain that this door is not only a heavy door, it is a security airlock door.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** And it seems like it has...

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** These mechanisms in it.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:42]** If you remember the doors when you first came in, after you fought the tiny toy Sheeran, right?

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:47]** Those doors there had those locking mechanisms on them.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:51]** These seem like they're similar, but more industrial grade.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** There are eight of them.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** Sorry, let's call them vault grade mechanisms.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Whoa.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Pretty difficult.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Fascinating.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Yeah.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Pretty difficult to unlock these.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** There's a panel in it.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:11]** And you couldn't see it when you were far away because it just looked like maybe it was part of the flickering light.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:22]** But there is a warning symbol in the middle of the panel that looks like three red lines in the form of a triangle.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** You got a 30.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:35]** You can tell that those three red lines indicate some sort of emergency seal on the door.

**[00:33:35 - 00:34:02]** you also know you realize this could be a door to a possible way out but this is clearly locked and indicating that it's sealed for an emergency only it would only open in an emergency or it's sealed by emergency like power or what yeah it's sealed by emergency power but

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:26]** unclear where you could go from here other than you could it would be very difficult to unlock each mechanism well we could give it a shot we are fairly okay at this typically done by a computer is typically how you do it is there any like porthole can i look out there's not a porthole these are pretty heavy doors


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:34]** But you're saying this is an exit from whatever... It's not necessarily... Well, we don't even know if we're on a spacecraft or we're on the planet still.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:37]** I retract what I said a few episodes ago.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** No, but we're looking for the way down to the reactor.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Yeah, true.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** And this is not that way, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Right, I think.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Don't you hand wave me.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:53]** Well, it'll take but a few seconds to try to open it, even if it doesn't work.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Here's who's going to try to open it.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** He rolls a... Oh, jeez.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** I have a huge computer bonus, but I only rolled a 15.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Does anyone want to help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I'll assist.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** Oh, wait.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Yeah, I assist.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Okay.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** 18.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** I can't fail at computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** Rick glances at it and has no idea what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:22]** So 17, yeah, it is way beyond what you would think be able to do.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** There is a DC for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** So this is a dead end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:31]** Again, it seems like the only way to get through this is the fastest way is to work through a computer.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:36]** That's likely where these doors at this size are operated from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** It is possible that this is not the way down.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** This is just a way out, which may also be very valuable later on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:48]** In the future, perhaps we could utilize this exit.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** Is there anything in the alcove here?

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** You haven't revealed it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Dr. O'Kane hears.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Thanks.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I was going to get there, Kev.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Dr. O'Kane hears.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** No, no.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** That was a genuine thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** We've all been standing here for like 20 minutes and you still can't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Dr. O'Kane hears.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** You guys are going to die right now.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** I'm trying a green orb.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** 21.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** 24.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Four.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Four.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** It looks like a slightly larger alcove.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** And there are three pods here.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** There's another one of those burned arches.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:36]** There are two more of these floating shelves.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:45]** And then there also just seems to be some sort of device in the corner that is likely... I don't think you guys asked about it before.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:55]** There appears to be some sort of a small device, maybe three feet, that looks like a mini fridge sitting right next to where you are.

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:02]** But the weird thing is that in the deep recess of the corner, there appears to be a...

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** Mimic.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Like, pile of bones.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** I'm going to reveal it.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:12]** It looks like some sort of gore.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Like, you see limbs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** I was going to say, it looks like a blood splatter to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:23]** Yeah, you see limbs and, like, it's mostly liquid, but also organs.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** That's disgusting.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** From various creatures.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** And you see pushing its way out of it.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Oh, my God.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** Is this...

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:54]** creature that you can barely make out in the dim light it's about the size of like maybe a foot long it's this disgusting invertebrate creature and the skin is semi-translucent

**[00:37:54 - 00:38:03]** And then its head comes up and tapers to a fine point and it slides out from inside the goo and then sits up.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:15]** So it's just sitting on its back tail and it looks at you and it slowly, as it rears its body up, it slowly unfolds.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:34]** five jaws each of them shaped like the petal of a flower and lined with row upon row of curved barb sharp razor teeth and it emits this noise that you all hear as like

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:46]** As it, like, spits at you, and you need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** A Quinta Demogorgon thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Can we just make it, like, one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Here we go.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** We got through one episode without a battle last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** I'm not a battle, though.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** I'm talking about, like, just a room.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Like, a full room without fighting something.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** A full room.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** This is all the same hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** It does seem like a video game, right?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** So, like we were saying earlier, that this is probably some game, but...

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** Yeah.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** Here we go.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** I need a roll initiative.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** Sorry.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Yeah.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** And you know what?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** I'm going to roll this giant one on the floor.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:22]** I usually pre-roll my initiatives, but this time I'm going to roll it on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** I'm never going to roll that giant one on the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:28]** I do find that giant dice typically don't roll the best.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** I do have to say.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** As much as I love them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** It bounced a little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** I have a seven.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Okay, let's go around.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Rick19 got a seven.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** 10.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Oh, man.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Here's... 19.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Wow.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Ooh.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** Great call.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** Okay.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:55]** So, it must be that, Dr. O'K, you were still looking at the panel in front of the door.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Yes.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** And even though you heard that noise, that...

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** As it like opens its jaws, here's turn saw and was like time for action.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** So top around one.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** Here's it is your turn.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** What are you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** We run for it.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Let's not worth.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** It's not worth the fight.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Uh, actually here's concurs with that.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** All right.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Bye.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Let's get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:25]** See you later.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Let's cover our retreat.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** We're just like, nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Okay.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** I look so disappointed right now.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Oh, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** I'm not disappointed at all, man.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:33]** I'm good.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** I was just reading something.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** All right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** All right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** So what do you do?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Here's just says, nope.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** And then starts walking down.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:47]** So for the listener, this is the last alcove in a long hallway.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** So there's this last alcove and this door that we can't open yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Looking at Bernice's movements.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** There's nowhere else to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** We're just walking away from this creature.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** It's not even worth getting involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Yeah, screw it.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** There's like a giant meatball and a snake face.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** A meatball of flesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** A snake-faced meatball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** It's like that thing from Doom coming out of the sand.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Would you paddle that?

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:37]** all right so here we'll just ride it yeah do you double move do you uh here's can move yeah here's his double moving also he can move like an extra 10 feet so double moving i can just move twice basically right so i can move 80 feet is your speed 40 feet yeah it is now okay wow there's also is it sprint or whatever i gotta look it up again damn i'm like all the way down here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Yeah, dude, you can run.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Yeah, run.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Okay, run.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** It's a full action to do that.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** You move four times your speed.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:46]** Well, fuck.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:52]** Yeah, so you could just sprint down this hallway and go four times your speed, but you have to go in a straight line and there can be no obstacles.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:52]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Yep.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** I think you're good for no obstacles.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Well, you were there.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Yeah, I don't think you can.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** I mean, I still can get pretty far.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** This is about as far as I can get still pretty far.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** Just doing double moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Pretty far is relative.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** We don't know how fast this thing can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** That's true.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** What are you thinking as you start running?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:39]** here's is concerned about his compatriot i'm sure that they'll he'll i'm sure that he's sure that they'll make it i don't know like he just doesn't he just doesn't want to deal with it that's great he'll help out if we need he just doesn't want to deal with this thing that looks like it's from dune or it does yeah so it's like a tiny version yeah he's just running scary it's size tiny yeah

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** He's just running, thinking, like, we gotta find the reactor.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** And he only knows one way forward, which is around the corner, so he's running that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:49]** I just want to, like, rules lawyer the run stuff real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Always welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** As a full action, you can run.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:58]** When you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight running.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** You gain flat-footed condition, first of all.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:08]** And you can't run if you must cross difficult terrain or you can't see where you're going.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** So you can't run around a corner.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:14]** And then I guess you can't run into fog of war either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Can you run into each other?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** No, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** Yeah, I guess you can run through each other because that's a free action.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Or free movement.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:29]** Running provokes attacks of opportunity and you can only run the number of rounds equal to your constitution score.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Just to keep that in mind.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:36]** So whatever our constitution scores are, that's how many times you can do a run action in a row.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** All right.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Good to know.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** I'll close the rules lawyer.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** I conclude.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** You take off your rules lawyer hat.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Thank you, rules lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Yeah, thanks, everyone.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** I rest my case.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** Case is rested.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Is that how that goes?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:50 - 00:44:00]** Yeah, that's what I'm pretty sure as two of the people here have significant others who are lawyers and are paralegals can confirm what is done.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Yeah, that's what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** I also haven't watched nearly enough Law and Order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** So, here's Runs Away.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Past Rick, past Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** No, yours took two movements.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:18]** Took two movements away, down the hallway, the sound of your boots echoing down the hallway away from you all.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** As this fearsome, tiny worm-like invertebrate stares you down.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** and Rick and Bernice, you see the creature start to sweat.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:42]** Start to move in a way that you didn't think that even though it's so tiny and you can't really tell where its body is because you can almost see through it.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:49]** It begins to shift and move almost like a cobra or a snake trying to pull your attention.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:56]** And Dr. OK and Bernice need to give me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** We'll save.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** We'll save.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** We'll save.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** We'll save.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:05]** We'll save.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** Rolled a 16 plus 3, so 19.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** 19 for you.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** For Bernice.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** For Bernice.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** What about for Dr. Okay?

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Okay.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** 19 on the die.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Dang.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I see it.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Our listeners can't see it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** No, 23.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** 23.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:32]** You're watching, and for a second you feel like, wow, this is pretty fascinating.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:43]** And your concentration on it is broken when you see that out of its mouth is this long proboscis that is moving out.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** It's almost the length of its body.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:52]** And you can tell that it's trying to hypnotize you and keep you fascinated.

**[00:45:52 - 00:46:00]** But both you and Bernice, because I didn't ask if Bernice can be subject to mind affecting effects, but it doesn't matter.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** Probably not.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:09]** Probably not, but for the purpose of this, both of you are fine, and you are not fascinated.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** Is Rick not in range?

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Rick is not in range.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:17]** So you see it happening, and you're able to keep your cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** This thing tries to hunt you with its thing that...

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** hangs from its face.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** Yeah.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** I'm opening my jaw and it just moves out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** If you Google proboscis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** I'm afraid to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** Like those things that flies have where they suck on your skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** Do you guys see this?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:47]** It's a pharyngeal proboscis where it moves out of their mouth because it's in their esophagus.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** It's pretty gross.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** But also... Do you have a picture of it?

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** I don't know.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Me?

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** I shared it earlier, I thought.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** I didn't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** It didn't pop up like this.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Wow, this thing is vicious looking.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** It's just a skeletal version of the dune worm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** Yeah, you can see it's like semi-translucent.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** With...

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:15]** translucent camouflage and a f***ing giant-ass spear coming out of its horned ass mouth.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Talk about tremors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Tremor nightmares coming back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Yeah, it's awesome.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Tremors.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** It's a great creature.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Kevin Bacon.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Kevin Bacon.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Kevin Bacon.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** What a series.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Underrated series.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Underrated.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Sci-fi Sunday classic.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** I feel like Tremors 2 is peak, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** No, Tremors 1 is the best one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:42]** Tremors 1 is amazing, and it is a masterpiece of B. Yeah.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** B plus cinema.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Sci-fi channel standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Followed closely by Tremors 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Oh, please, no.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** I think they did have a Tremors 5 recently, but that's for another time.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Dr. Okay, let's see whose turn it is.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** It is Dr. Okay.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Okay, so we're booking it.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Dr. Okay, run.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:17]** Yeah, I'm going to double move, but first I'm going to inject myself with a bit of a booster to give my movement a pep in my step.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** Is that a swift action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Is that a swift action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** Uh, no, it's just, uh, I believe it's a basic booster.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** So it'd be like applying like standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** So then you can only run once or what?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Or move once.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Move once.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** You're gonna move once.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:40]** If I call him Dr. Or is that a pun that's usable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** He has pep in his step.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** He's a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Dr. Pep.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** How about the delivery?

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** It was a delivery that failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** You should really appreciate that too.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** I just finished a bottle.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:58]** I think legally every time that we say Dr. Pepper, I have to bleep.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** So I'm just going to bleep.

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Is that true?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** You have to say registered trademark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** Dr. Pepper registered trademark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** You have to mumble it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** We're not sponsored by Dr. Not yet.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Yeah.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Please, please give us money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:16]** I drink enough Dr. They should sponsor us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** You should.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Dr. Okay, what are you doing?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** You going to run?

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:25]** Well, I'm going to just use my full movement to move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** You inject yourself and move out.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** I'm going to guess Bernice moves as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** Yeah.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:37]** So I'm willing to move 35 feet now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Dr. Oki could just pick Bernice up.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** She's a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** I'm late for work.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Just like Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:45 - 00:50:13]** me also did you realize that if you click and drag to a square and then press q it'll give you a little oh which is helpful i've done that yeah just because it gives you a what you can click and then do this and then do this oh look at that yeah i think you're still doing q just press q with the with the measure just hold hold q while you're moving your thing yeah so click drag press q when you want to change direction and then pick up and press q when you want to do it again

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:17]** So I think you're still good having moved there unless you want to move somewhere else.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** So Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:42]** runs 35 feet down the hall, carrying Bernice past Rick, who is left staring at this mini dune... And as a swift action, I'm going to give a little bit of slime between us, perhaps, in my, you know, flight, fight or flight...

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:47]** sort of response to situations like this, I get a little inky.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:52]** I get a little inky.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** I get too excited and it just oozes out of me and I don't know what to do about it.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** So there's going to be a little spot here on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** And that is a swift action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Yes.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** To just spot.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** I don't know why I rolled.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** Oh, I suppose I could roll to see how many times you can do it per day.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Oh, I rolled a four.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Okay.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Nice.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** You got three more inkies.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** So you drop some ink.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Do you want to put on the square?

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Slime.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Sorry.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Some slime.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** You want to put where you do it and grab Bernice as you run away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:34]** Rick, what do you want to do?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:38]** Do we know if this thing has an intelligence score of a one or a two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** You need to do a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** I'm terrible at life science checks, though.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** Let me go to my hero lab.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** My hero lab, but I was in something.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Life science.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** I don't even have... Oh, I do have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Twelve.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** More than meets your mind.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Alright.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Twelve total.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** You're not quite sure what this creature is.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** So you don't know whether it has an intelligence score of one or two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:13]** Rick kind of squints at it and tries to study it just a little bit as, as like Dr. Okay's running away.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** And then he's like, Nope.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** Um, and I forget how far, hold on one second.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Let me see how fast Rick can run.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** Okay.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:28]** Rick has a movement speed of 30, and I can fly 30 feet.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** I do have jump jets.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Are you going to fly?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Let me see.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** How do you do it?

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** So you click, pull, and then cue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:39]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:42]** Yeah, I'm going to jump jet to here.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Okay.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** I love it.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** I feel like... Nice.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:51]** Did you jump jet or did you just kind of run and use little boosts to push you over the slide?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Every step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Yeah.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Rad.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** Because you could fly, but why?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:22]** yeah all right top around two oh wait wait i can run twice but no i'm gonna i'm actually gonna but it's not straight i thought i thought life science is uh we've been we've been doing this just as a free action okay it probably still okay you can do the fraction yeah um but yeah rick is going to stay i don't i'm not going to say i'm going to like hold an action okay i'll still be here in case that thing comes

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Okay, you're staying right there.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Top of round two.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Here's what are you doing?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** You're way down the hall past them.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Another at least 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Here's just Shouts hoping to be audible.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** Let's go around the corner to the other place we haven't been to yet.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** And then just like start running around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Try to find the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Well, all right.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** So you start running again down the hall.

**[00:53:48 - 00:54:10]** oh yeah it is the creature's turn and you all wait for a minute you think maybe you hear that saying like sound again but then you don't hear anything and it doesn't seem to come around the corner and you all wait for a minute


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:39]** you don't hear anything and it doesn't seem to follow you so we're going to move out of combat oh dang that was easy we should do this more we should just run away from everything yeah just run away run away um the bounder didn't follow us nothing follows us it's fine it just comes out of the ground all right this is metagaming just a little bit but like looking at the map we were told to go to the northeast corner we ended up going down a hallway like he said north northeast

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** North, northeast, yeah.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:46]** But we went out of the room and went south and then east and then north.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** So I do think maybe we should check this region up here.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:55]** I'm pointing on the map, but I think we should have gone... You're talking about the one with the scrapes on the ground, right?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** Yeah, that's my issue with this, is there's giant scrape marks across the ground.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** This is probably the troll thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** I don't know.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Totally agree, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** But Rick and Dr. O.K.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** probably joined here in the hallway over here.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:14]** You guys walk back down the hallway past the door where you have seen on Dr.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** O.K.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:20]** 's chemilizer these ticks, spikes of radiation, erratic radiation.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** You walk down the long hallway.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** You begin walking north past the room where you first found out

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** and communicated with the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** We should roll a perception before turning the corner.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Kind of peeking heads around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:42]** Bernice, I think, peered around the corner before, and I told you, but I didn't reveal it.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:46]** So to your left is another... There's a giant door to a ladder well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** Bernice knew this the whole time, but didn't tell anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:57]** To your left, you see a set of double doors, not unlike the ones behind you on your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** To the comms room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Yes, but there's another room there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** It's closed.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:05]** To your right, the hallway extends maybe another 50 feet.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:16]** And you see that at the far end, the hallway closes in a V-shaped curve.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:21]** And on the north side, there are two doors.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** Both look like light doors, meaning, like, not heavy.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Not like the one that you saw before.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:32]** The one at the far end is intact.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:41]** The one that is right in front of you has been cut open in several places.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Crumpled.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** And partially melted.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:50]** The door frame is damaged severely.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:57]** And those scrapes that you see on the map as you're walking, you look down, here's at your boot.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:11]** You realize that they're smears of dark liquid running on the floor from inside of that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:39]** and that's our game oh damn it no you always stop at like the worst times classic hey it's Kevin yeah I just want to take this time to talk about retreating and how it's it's okay to retreat you don't need to fight everything I think that gives us a little bit of insight into our friendly neighborhood murder bot Rick's not just trying to shoot everything that moves

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** You know, it might appear that way because he's really good at shooting things.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** But in this case, it's okay to, like, not fight.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** It's okay to walk away.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:53]** We're not playing some kind of dungeon crawler where we need to squeeze experience out of every monster we find just to get down to the next level.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:59]** No, in this game, Dr. Okay, Hears, and Rick are just trying to survive.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** And maybe that worm was just trying to defend itself.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:07]** Maybe it had eggs and it was like a little mommy or daddy worm trying to protect its young.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** So in that sense, it's okay not to get into a fight.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** Hashtag it's okay to walk away.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** And that's not just like a game tip.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** That's a life lesson.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Sometimes you need to just back up and run.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:28]** It's okay to walk away, whether that's physically or mentally or emotionally and spiritually.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** And with that, happy Valentine's Day.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Thanks a lot for listening.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** We really appreciate it.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** We'll catch you again next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Kevin, out.
