## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously on We'll Save...

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:16]** Entering the room to investigate the ringing in here's ears revealed an Abadar defense droid whose modifications deal more death than defense, and who at the sight of our adventurers decided to move in and destroy.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:23]** Rick, in a daring move, went prone, hoping that the bot wasn't programmed with melee attacks in mind, while Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:31]** tried to remotely access the robot to disable the menacing mods with the help of his knife-wielding briefcase Bernice.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:39]** As Hears moved in to see how well this bot plays with injectable nanobots, the robot turned its gaze to meet Hears face to face.

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:43]** Can our cadre conquer this cross contender?

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:47]** Or is our crew, in the immortal words of Bender, totally boned?

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:51]** Find out this time on Will Sage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:53]** Let it be known that today, of all days, the day that we are recording episode 50, Will counted down our sync.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** What?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** I was upset because you wouldn't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** Well, because Will kept talking and then I was asking.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I was like, did you?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** And then you're like, I got an intro.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** And I'm like, do you want to talk about something with the intro?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I was just trying to give you the space.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** But instead, you did it.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** And you know what?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** I'm proud of you.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** That was good.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Because that's what we do on episode 50.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Smoothest countdown we've ever had, Will.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** It was good energy.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** It was good energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** It was BPE.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Big podcast energy.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** That's what that was.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Yeah.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Episode 50.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** Bring in the BPE into your life.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** That's why you listen to Will Save.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** Cool.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** No one has energy.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Wait, so it's episode 50.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Does that mean I have to get you guys gifts?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Yeah, what should we get each other for our episode 50 gifts?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Or should we stay for episode 52 gifts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** Yeah, well, episode 52 is like one year, so is that like a one-year anniversary?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** Yeah, I think that 52... It's like 42, but 10 more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** Or like 62 but 10 less, actually.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** The item for 50th anniversary is gold.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:07]** So should we get gold gifts for each other now and then go to paper next week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Why the f*** does it go to paper after gold?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, that's weird stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** Well, because 52 is back to the one year.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:20]** This is the 50th anniversary, weekly anniversary, but 52 would be our one year anniversary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:25]** I think we get, on 52, I think we get matching tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** That's what I think we do.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I'm down.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** You get tattoos all the time.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** I haven't gotten a tattoo in over a decade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** Until two weeks from today when we record episode 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Until two weeks from today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Will, Kelly, your thoughts?

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** On a gift?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** No, on attention.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:47]** Yeah, yeah, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** We'll save right next to my caution hot tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** And where is your caution hot tattoo?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Yeah, tell us.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Tell us.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Tell all of our listeners.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Kevin, it appears you're talking, but no sound is coming out.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** I can't hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Oh, was I muted?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** I said it.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, say it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I think you need to say it again, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** I think it was bleeped out.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** Private knowledge that we can't air on.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** It can't be aired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I have a tattoo.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** It is a little sign that says Caution Hot.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** It is one of several tattoos.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:36]** And it is located in a place that I would use that tattoo as an excuse to show that location in public.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:40]** So, we're not going to say what it is, but that's your clue.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** It's my butt.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** I'll say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Oh, come on.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** It's on my butt.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** They probably would have thought something worse than that.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** I know.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** That's what I was saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** As I was saying it, I was like, oh, gosh.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** It could have been taken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** They will think it's worse if you don't say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:58]** Kev, you do realize that that is... Kev, that was the mystery of the three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** That was going to be it.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Where's Kev's tattoo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** You...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** Messed it up.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It's on your butt.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** You do have a tattoo on your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** The little communications from the greys are just like, oh my god, really?

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** That's like their entire communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:15]** I am all for a Will Save tattoo, though.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** I'm for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** We should do it.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:22]** Can I just give a quick anecdote about your tattoo, Kev, or one of them, the one of the topic?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Wait, what was I going to say?

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** Which is just to say...

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:47]** oh well yeah nothing i said nothing oh see see that's what i thought at the top of the countdown and then will was like just go you're right and then he's three two one clap okay so here's the thing kev if you ask him we'll show you his tattoo i know this because when he first told me he showed me we were at a bar anytime that we've been at a bar he will show you or anywhere i can imagine it

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:55]** Yeah, so this means that if you need us, you could ask him, and hopefully you would do that, and then we would hopefully still be invited back to do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** If any listener asked me, I'll show you my butt if you ask.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** That's not a hard ask.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** That's not a hard ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Let it be known.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Let it be known.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** I wrote a four.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Okay, that passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** People are going to start walking up to you, Kev.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Odd times.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** You're literally in the hospital.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** I feel bad for my son.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:30]** All the way until he's grown and out of the house, random people are going to be like, I heard you have a tattoo on your... Yep, right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** You're a cool dad with a tattoo on his butt.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** But where are we going to get our Will Save tattoos?

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** Right over our hearts, where it's most important.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** Will.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Inside the arm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** I don't think Will and Kelly are down.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** I think it's only you and me, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Oh.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** No, I'm just thinking where it would be.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** I don't know.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Right across your forehead?

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Yeah, like a triangle.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:59]** A triangle outlines from the peak of your eyebrow down to each side of your cheek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** What are we actually getting?

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** What are we getting as a tattoo?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** I think the triangle is awesome.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Or unless you just want to get WS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** I want the full triangle with the pink glow.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** I want the full... What if you get whatever you want to get, but it's a will save thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Or should we all get the same one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Yeah, as long as it's will save related.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** You can get whatever design you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** Like Chad, for example, if you wanted to put some tattoos.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** Just Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** The little surfer with the AK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** With like an AK-47.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, that won't make any sense at all.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:36]** If you ever see that out somewhere, then you know.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** That's how you know that you're a listener.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** That's the deep cut tattoo that you have to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Aw, Chad.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Hey, bro.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Wait, Will, what are you thinking?

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** Will's safe tattoo or Will's scheming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** A briefcase.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** I'll think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** Just Bernice on your ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** Just the name Bernice on your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** Just the name Bernice on your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** It's perfect.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:04]** I could get Nike, which is Bernice's namesake.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** It's true.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** That's true.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** If that vibes with you, I think you should.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** No.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** Okay.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** I wouldn't get that.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** But maybe of that vein.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Wait, do you guys have tattoos?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Any of you?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** No, but I want one.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** No, not really.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** I'm the only one out of this group that has tattoos.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** If we're going over total tattoos, I think last time I counted, I have seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** What?

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** That's more than I even knew that you had.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** All of my tattoos, I kind of had a rule when I was getting them because I was in the Navy.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:37]** And my rule was like, all my tattoos wouldn't be visible if I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** They'll all be in interesting places and they'll all be interesting.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** That's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:46]** I have like a, I have like a quarter sleeve, you know, up around my shoulder that runs onto my chest.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** I have something that runs across my back and kind of over my, my other shoulder.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** I have caution hot as we talked about.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:59]** Um, and then I have, I have a bear that represents the California.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** It's like a cave painting of the California flag on my calf.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:10]** Um, and then I have, uh, a pig and a chicken or rooster on my feet.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** That's a navel tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Uh, and then lastly I have the green land.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** I had, it's gone for sure.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** I had the green lantern symbol on my middle finger, um,

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:50]** in blacklight ink that's rad but the blacklight ink um and being on your finger fades really quickly so it's actually completely gone now which kind of sucks but it was cool why it lasted yeah i think that's all of them interesting that's it that's neat so i'm i'm due for another so we'll save it so we'll save tattoo so i thought i was i was supposed to get a usc tattoo and i never did that's right we were gonna do a usc one uh we didn't well with that beautiful transition


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Should we play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Wait, Kelly and John's first tattoo.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** What?

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** Kelly and John's first tattoo.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** Oh, it's going to be the Will Save logo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:59 - 00:09:59]** Yeah.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** I'm down.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** That might work out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Across your forehead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I think I've already talked about what my other tattoo idea would be.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Just your neck.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Right across your neck.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Yeah, on my neck.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** I think I'll get it in front of my regular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** The triangle just outlines your Adam's apple.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** That's it.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** So attractive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** Yeah, so you have a target and you want to punch me in the throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:24]** This is a pet peeve, but neck tattoos make... It's funny because neck tattoos make it look like you don't have a neck.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** The tattoo takes away your neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:30]** I did see one time this person had a really beautiful neck tattoo.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** And it was only on the side of his neck.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** And it was just really intricately drawn and colored neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:38 - 00:11:01]** roses there were two single roses on both the sides of his neck and it looked like a beautiful piece of art it didn't look like some people also like have you know cultural tattoos yep that are like beautiful also it's true in a way very true i just i don't think it's anything to do with like what the tattoo is i there's something about like putting color on your throat area

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:07]** just visually eliminates your neck area.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** And so it looks like you're wearing a turtleneck or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:14]** If you have tattoos or neck tattoos, send us pictures.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Tag us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** And I'm not trying to be mean.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** That's just how they look to me.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** That's just what I see when I see somebody wearing those tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** We're going to move off the topic so you don't offend anybody else, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Right.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:29]** So talking about ass tattoos... Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** So...

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** Let's just say that last time, last episode was freaking awesome.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:41]** Mostly because we had the beautiful debut of Bernice.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Our briefcase with a knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** I love her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** She's gorgeous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** I want a t-shirt of Bernice.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** That's for sure.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** She's a briefcase with a knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Is that Bernice's voice?

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** I don't know.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** That's Bernice's voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** You're workshopping it.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** You're workshopping it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Wait, so Bernice doesn't talk, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:05]** No.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** I don't think Bernice actually talks without an actual voice module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** But Dr. Okay can talk through Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** That's so great.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:22]** So you all come into this room that you've identified as some sort of communications hub.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:34]** There's a console you can connect to, and there are hails waiting on this console as you are about to leave.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:50]** investigate further you realize that there is a avatar corp gatekeeper robot that is affiliated with this console you move up it begins to attack you as it becomes aware of you and

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:56]** Rick, very smartly, in the first round, goes prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** I was just trying to do something new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** I like it.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** It's awesome.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yeah.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** A for effort.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:07]** Just getting ready to, like, snipe someone like you do sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** Yeah.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** I can picture you, like, you know, spreading.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** You got, like, the...

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Bernice goes up.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Through Dr.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** O.K.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:21]** 's sweet VR goggles, Bernice hacks into the robot, successfully bypassing the security layer.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:26]** Possibly this episode, will Bernice slash Dr. O.K.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** override the command module?

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:35]** Or the module for the modifications that have been made?

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:40]** Then Hears uses this awesome... Oh, by the way, the robot did knock out... What was that?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** 12th?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** 12 points of damage to you, Rick?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Was it 12?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** It was a good amount of damage as it slammed you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** Doing the math, yes, it was 12 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:14:04]** Then, Hears comes up, says, oh, and by the way, Bernice and Hears both made an attack for opportunity, notable because it was Bernice making an attack with a knife, which is where we get this from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:23]** kelly still funny yeah you're like dude should i explain oh sure please please explain no no i want to hear what you want to say what's on your mind oh well what's well there's always a lot on my mind so thank you for asking whatever asks yeah thanks i want to know yeah it's important that you express yourself


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Beware.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:43]** So you said, let me cast this super cool spell where you reach into your mouth, bite down on one of your fangs, the blood comes out, you reach out to cast Inject Nanobots, and I'm sure at the tip of your finger you can see your blood starting to become this swarm of nanobots.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** It's super neat.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:49]** And as we identified last time, you do have to make a melee attack roll against the creature's EAC.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Okay.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:54]** So, now is when you need to make that attack roll.

**[00:14:54 - 00:15:00]** As we're back at the end of round one with Hears, give me your attack roll.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** Let me move you guys over on Rolls-Royce.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** Sorry, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:08]** No, I'm just saying, dear beautiful listeners, I didn't read entirely this thing.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** But I do need to make a melee attack.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:13]** So, Hears draws blood and you realize he actually has to strike him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** So, Kelly, this is...

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** This is one of the things that we talked about.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Magic Missile hits automatically.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:21]** I think it's one of the only spells that hits automatically.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:26]** Where Inject Nanobots, it has a melee attack roll.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:36]** So by the rules of lethal to non-lethal, you could take a minus four on your attack and make it a non-lethal attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:36 - 00:16:00]** i'm just putting that out there well i'm glad you too bad you're prone so you're heavily implying from your prone position that i should be not lethally attacking this thing i mean like you just witnessed bernice try to hack this thing and successfully get in i don't know what bernice is trying to do she might be trying to shut it down i don't know if you're trying to get any information doesn't know it's valid stop metagaming here's doesn't know

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** If anyone wants to shout it out, feel free to do it.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Here's just going to follow through with this.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Because anyway, he only rolled an 11.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** This is why I like Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** You rolled an 11?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Plus what?

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Yeah, 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** No, plus 3 is 11.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Stupid melee attacks.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** This is why I'm a wizard, basically, in this world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** Because I don't like this.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** And you burned a spell slot for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:31]** It burns when you attempt to.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** So you reach out.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** I shouldn't have even done this spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:42]** Good thing to point out though, casting this spell does not provoke an opportunity to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** I forgot about that.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Thank you for classifying in the spell.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** It does not provoke an attack.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** See, that all worked out.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Nothing gained, nothing lost.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** You tried to do it.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:55]** You weren't attacked.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:55]** It's fine.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** But you do reach out.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** And I'm thinking maybe that drop of blood falls just onto the ground.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** And then you try and reach out, and the robot moves at the last second.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** And you're like, ah, can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** The little nanobots just scatter in various directions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Yeah.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:11]** We're free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Damn it.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** What else does not happen?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** Bye.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Get back here.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:22]** What else do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** The end of round one here.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Well, now here sees this.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** Can he assist Bernice at all in her?

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Oh, wait.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** I don't know what she's going to do next, so I don't suppose I could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:38]** If that's your attack, your attack is the you're using a standard action as the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Well, I moved and then I attacked.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** Yeah.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** So I probably can't do anything else.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yeah, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:49]** Especially like I think hacking is one of the skills that is it takes place of a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Yeah.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** OK, cool.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Yep.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Yeah, that's probably it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:59]** Okay, top of round two, Rick19, you've been slammed and you're on the ground.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Looking cool, though.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** So what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** So I did the whole prone thing, hoping this thing wouldn't come towards me, and then it rolls right towards me.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:11]** And then I was like, oh, man, standing up is a move action.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:17]** So I was like, crap, I'm just going to be able to stand up, and I'm not going to be able to switch, so then I would take an attack of opportunity.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:20]** But I remembered, so standing up is a move action.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:27]** And drawing a weapon is usually a move action unless you have an attack bonus that's high enough.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** And so Rick has a high enough attack bonus.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** So as he stands up, he kind of just leaves.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** He sheds the artillery laser kind of off to the side.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:42]** And as he stands up, he draws his axe out with him.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** Nice.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:49]** And then he just picks it up above his head, and he's just going to hit this thing with the hilt of the axe.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Just like cross the face.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Bam.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** I love it.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** I can totally picture it.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Bam.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** That is 11 points to hit.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** And so he goes to do that, and he completely misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:06]** As you're standing up, you try and swing, and you stumble.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** You're a little off balance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** Yeah, so much for trying to look cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** Don't quite... Well, you looked cool laying on the ground.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** You're cool.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** I mean, you're fine.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** All right.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Good attempt.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Good attempt.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:24]** Let's see what round two Gatekeeper Robot will do.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Hears did not hit.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:33]** Bernice did hack through Dr. Okay, and Dr. Okay did not hit.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** I feel like...

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:41]** Part of me wants to see whether the robot is aware that Bernice attacked, like, hacked him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:47]** Well, didn't you say, no, you said the attack of the opportunity was with stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Was with stealth.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Yeah.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:53]** I tried to use, Bernice does have a stealth ability.

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:01]** So if, like, you're trying to, perhaps maybe you're looking, the droid is going to scan it maybe and see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:01]** I don't know.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** My thought was twofold.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:09]** The droid would first try and notice, is there something else in its programming, right?

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:31]** the second is if it does does it perceive where it's coming from so it's two roles first is does it know which i think is a luck role second one is a perception check because bernice is let's say tiny i'm gonna say it needs to meet a pretty like maybe like a pretty straightforward perception role is that sentence does that make sense is there like a way to counter though like i would


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:43]** Bernice would try to, as somebody's trying to hack into a mechanical object, would not necessarily want to be noticed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:43 - 00:21:05]** physically or the hacking part like in the mainframe you're trying to be discreet or you're trying to physically be discreet and hide from the robot physically try to be discreet as the robot okay nice I kind of have to ask like where do you see stealth on the sage drone I'm looking at the revolution Sagan


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** It's a skill unit.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:13]** So as standard, like a Sage drone, all drones get units.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:17]** But Sage drone has a bonus for if you look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** It says bonus skill unit two of the following.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** Computers, culture, life, science, mysticism, physical science, and profession.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:29]** So you get two of those and none of those are stealth units.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:36]** Now, you're level four, and I think you get additional feats or something, whatever they're called, different modifications.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:44]** So you might have a modification that gives you stuff, but you don't have it under the... I see it on my Hero Lab list, and I just clicked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Okay.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** And it said green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** Okay, so it's probably a modification, then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** Yeah, so there's like, you're allowed three slots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** I don't mean to rules lawyer everything.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** You are rules lawing everything.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:02]** Kind of my position on this podcast.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** Will size.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Skill unit.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:12]** Drone can use skill ranks when you are directly controlling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** No, okay, I take that back.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** So under skills unit, it says choose one of the following.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** Acrobatics, athletics, computers, engineering, perception, or stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** But it says choose one of the following skills.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:27]** Your drone can use this skill when not under direct control.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:30]** You can change your skill unit whenever you rebuild it.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:37]** Whenever directly controlling your drone, it can use any skill, skill ranks, if you wish, assuming it has the appropriate tools to do so.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:40]** So you're using the skill.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:44]** It's the same thing as your character can use a skill as its standard action.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:53]** Instead of using direct control, the drone is using its skill unit, and stealth would be the skill unit.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:59]** So if you're doing an attack, you can't do the skill unit at the same time that you're attacking, is the way I'm reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Meaning?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:09]** So I think what would have needed to happen is that you would make a stealth check as a move action or as part of a move action.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:14]** Because now I'm reading in the stealth skill and I'm reading high.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Didn't I ask to move with stealth?

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** You did, but then we didn't as do it.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** If you want to say that you tried to move a stealth, that's fine.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Because I think you were trying to attack from stealth.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** And I didn't know that you would roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** Yeah, I thought you said the attack of opportunity you were trying to use stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** And then you've moved up.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:34]** It makes sense to me that you would have... Now, if you want to be stealthy... Now I have to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Yeah, you would have to do it this turn.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** You have not moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:43]** Yeah, but on your turn now... Yeah, so Bernice could be spotted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** We'll just say that.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Could be, yeah.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Could be.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** I'm going to roll a 50-50 to see if the robot even notices that Bernice is in the mainframe.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Slash you are.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** Or is part of the programming.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** It's like hack net.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** So let me just do that.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** And then if you want to steal stealth, I think what would happen is you would roll a stealth check.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** Then I would at some point roll a perception check.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** If I fail, then I would have some sort of concealment against you.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Or you would have it against me, right?

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** I think that's what would happen.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** But we'd have to look at the senses to try and do that, which we can totally do.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** Let me just go ahead and get this 50-50.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:19]** We'll say if I get above 50, then I notice you.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** If I get below, I don't.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** So I'm going to roll this.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:30]** 24 doesn't notice that Bernice is in the mainframe.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** Nice.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** So, unfortunately, not nice for you, Rick, as the robot will now slam you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** It's going to try to.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:47]** Lastly, so reading what I'm trying to understand drones, it says limited AI, master control, and skill unit are all level one, whatever they are called.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** So I think they all apply.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** So the first one is limited AI.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:58]** You can tell your drone to do whatever you're going to tell it to do without any kind of action on your part.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:02]** You're just telling your drone telekinetically or through your whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** It has an AI that it will do on its own.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** It has limited commands for it to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:14]** And then the next level is you can take direct control of it, which gives you a little more.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:20]** And then the skill unit applies if you're using your actions as a skill.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** So that's the way I'm ready.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** Okay.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** I stand there.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** That is where Kev is standing.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** I rest my case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** That is where he is rested.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Does that change anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Rick is also standing at this point, so he has his full KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:39]** And I don't think you attack or you provoke an attack of opportunity by standing in a Starfinder.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** You do not.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:45]** But as you stand up and swing and you're off balance, it slams into you.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** I rolled an 11 on the die.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** It hit.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** For a 48 to hit?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:55]** That is 12 more points of damage as it slams into you.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** What was your attack?

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** This is ridiculous.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** The total to hit was a 23.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Oh, my God.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** I can't guess that hits.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Okay.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** I feel like you can't miss.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** You have a plus 20 on all your attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** It slams into you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** And as it does... You said 12 points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** 12 points of damage.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** And the loudspeaker, as it slams into you, it times it.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:24]** So as it hits you, the loudspeaker in your ear goes, Prepare for termination!

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** And just hits you.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:33]** I believe it is... The listener can't see my face, but this is frustration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** I'm frustrated for you, too.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Horrible.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** This is what frustration looks like.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** Dr. OK.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Dr. OK, it's your turn.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** What are you going to do?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Please hack it.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:50]** Command Bernice to hack disable the module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:56]** So recall that I think that 20 plus the hack DC, it was a 21 to hack.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** So it's a 41 to hack.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:12]** to get that's impossible i think i yeah right it's 20 plus your hack dc oh i'm not even gonna roll it then um what is the other computers check that you can do uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** Are you guys using John's handy-dandy hacking worksheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** That's what I'm using.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** There's no firewall to it, I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** Available on Instagram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Hey.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** I forgot about that.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** It's very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** You know, there... What's the site for that?

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Let me just put it in the...

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Because I have root access now, right?

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** No, you don't.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** You're just in.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** You got past the security layer.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Now you need to get root access.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Root access is 20 plus the hack DC.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** It's a 41.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Holy... What about just disable module?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** Why are you... 41?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** This game got impossible overnight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Well, it's not impossible.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:58]** You get ridiculous bonuses as you level up, so that is not impossible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Do we, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:06]** Have you listened to the big Starfinder show, Androids and Aliens, where Dr. Frisk nails every computer check?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:14]** He has failed only, I think, one in the past hundred episodes because he has great bonuses as a biohacker, but that's just a high DC.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** A character with root access?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** Okay, so gain root access.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:25]** My understanding is that to, and from this, is that to get into a module, you need to gain root access.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** But I could be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:30]** Yeah, I don't see how any of us would ever be able to beat a 41 right now, though.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** We can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:37]** Root access is a more advanced form of access that allows you to use all the computer's functions and modules, bypass or set conditions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:46]** And you can't just try to, like, destroy or repair a module, like the module that was modified on it to make this lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yeah, that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Yeah, I think that's the other problem is we're in combat.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** Like if we weren't in combat, then we could all assist maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Yeah, it would be possible.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** It's impossible in combat.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** So what do you want to do now?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** You want to try and just destroy them all?

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** I'm just trying to hide.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** You're going to hide?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Okay.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** Let me flip back to the skill section.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Using stealth.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Using stealth.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Let me go through.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** Okay, so I think you would essentially make a stealth roll.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** pretty sure you would make a stealth roll.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:22]** Then at some point, I would make probably a perception check to see if you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** Bernice just closes up and sits down like... That was just a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** I guess the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:35]** Closing her eyes so you can't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Okay.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** So what is your stealth roll?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** 14 on the die plus 6 is 20.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** 20 stealth roll.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Not bad.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Okay.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** So basically... Sorry.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** It's 4.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** Plus 4.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:52]** I thought it was 6.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** 18.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** 18.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Okay.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** So it's hiding, moved into there.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Then if...

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:03]** the creature wants to try and find Bernice, it would have to make a perception check because I think it's hiding, technically.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** That's what you're doing, right?

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** The check is opposed by the perception check of the creatures in the area that might detect you.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** Yep.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** If it fails, you have total concealment.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** Oh, it says as long as you have actual cover or concealment.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** I mean, it was a common item.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** Yeah, I feel like it's part of disguise, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Yeah.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:32]** I think I have a minus two to disguise for the creature, but certain magic that would work, but no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:35]** I think you can use stealth to hide because you're a common object.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** I think that makes sense.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** That kind of rolls into this, guys.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** If you're a common object, it's not going to know what's going on, right?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:47]** It retracts like a little bit and just sort of goes a little lifeless.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Lifeless, right.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Yeah, you're just an inanimate object.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** I think that makes sense.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:57]** And I think if the creature wants to attack you, we'll get into that.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:01]** Or if you move and want to attack or something else, a current AO, whatever, then we'll go from there.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Does that sound good?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Sure.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Sweet.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** But good movement, and I'm sorry that you're not going to hack it.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** But what do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** So you did hack into a certain level of it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Yeah.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:21]** So I could get its state and get as much information maybe about it.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** I think I can recall knowledge on it or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** Yeah, I mean, you could do... Oh.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Yeah.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:33]** You could probably do a life science, and I think since you're in, maybe you would get a bonus.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** But I would have had to have done that on my turn.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** I chose to hide.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Okay.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Well, Bernice chose to hide.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** What are you doing?

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Yeah.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** So that was your move action to control Bernice, right?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Or was that Bernice's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Okay.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:49]** No, that was a free action because it's limited AI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Yeah.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Yeah.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Okay.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** So it's Bernice's turn.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** So what are you going to do, Dr. Craig?


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** Dr. RK is going to hit him with the Costa Jet.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** Just the standard Costa Jet.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:04]** I don't know if the biohacks would work against the Construct.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** It doesn't say it doesn't, though.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:15]** It's a Construct, so it will have Construct immunities, so bleed, death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects, necromancy, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stun.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:20]** Also, side note, it does say that Construct immunities are immune to non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Oh, that's a fun fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** It's a little fun tidbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Dr. K, what are you thinking?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:30]** So I'm going to hit the droid.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Is it a droid or a robot?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** It's a robot.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Robot.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** I'm going to hit it with a... Is it immune to mind-affecting poisons?

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** It's just immune to poison.

**[00:32:41 - 00:33:06]** yeah so any poisons yeah just poisons okay so that rules out the pharmacological inhibitor okay but but minor inhibitor you take a minus one you'll take a if successful so i'm gonna load my costa jet costa jet with the uh basic inhibitor okay just roll the hit okay against ksc

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Right?

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Because you're shooting?

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Yeah.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Okay.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** I love it.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** So I'll throw in the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Roll high.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** You typically do, so I feel like you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Oh!

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:39]** nice natural i knew it i like as soon as i realized i was like will rolls high i was like he's gonna he's gonna nail it he's gonna nail it so not only so you do a crit for your damage right with the cards do you want to do a normal crit or do you want to do a card uh let me see the basic crit effects

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:42]** Are there any crit effects with your cost of jet?

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** I'm sure there are.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** Specials, injection, critical injection plus two.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:54]** If the weapon is used to deliver a poison or a drug of some kind, the save DC of that poison is increased by two when delivered on a critical hit.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** So there's a DC goes up.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** So you can either do that or you can do a card.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Or I can do it harder?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** No, a card.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Card.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** What do you guys think?

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** You want to card it or you want to increase the DC?


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** I vote card.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** Card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Okay.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** All righty.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Let me know when you want me to stop.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Three.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:18]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Three, two, one.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Stop.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Okay.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** First card from the top.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** This is a... What kind of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** It's kinetic, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** Yeah.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** I mean, it does acid damage.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Oh, okay.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** It does acid damage.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** So, I think it's kinetic, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** I hit you with a basic inhibitor to reduce your AC by two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** Yeah, so you automatically reduce my AC by two.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** You're going to deal double damage plus the effects both times.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:57]** Then your choice is either do a card or do this, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Yeah, doing the card.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** Okay.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** So the kinetic effects of the card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:05]** The kinetic effects of the card, it's called Surprise Opening.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Okay.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Crit effect.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** The target provokes attacks of opportunity from all threatening opponents.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Oh, nice.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Immediately?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** Yeah, that's a rad crit effect.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** That is amazing.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Ah, great.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** You reduce all ACs by two.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** You need to roll double damage and add your bonus both times.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Then...

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:34]** Everyone who's threatening, which is Rick, Kears, and Bernice, need to make an AOL on this creature at a minus two.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Amazing.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** Do we get our bonuses for that?

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** It's whatever your AOL is.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Cool.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** I don't think you would question it any other way, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Rick misses.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** I rolled a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** You rolled a two.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** Well, yeah.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** Dr. K, what was your damage?

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Let's go with the first damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Yeah, I haven't gone to damage yet.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Okay, so roll for damage.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Unfortunately, it's not a lot.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** That's fine.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:08]** Natural four from my brand new die from roller crit.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Yes!

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** So, four plus what?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** Yeah.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:15]** On a D4 plus four, so eight damage.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** Initial plus whatever the bonuses are.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Another four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** Another 16 points of damage, max damage.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Nice.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** See, that's why it's awesome.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** That is freaking awesome for you.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** That is really, really clutch.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:38]** It's ACs go down by two, both of them, which is also super clutch.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** As you can tell, that has some pretty high ACs.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** Now, everyone gets to make an AOO.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Rick, you missed.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:46]** So Bernice gets to make an AOO, and...

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Here's you get to make an AOA.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** So here's.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Make an AOA.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:55]** I still need a roll to attack as normal.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Yes.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** There's no bonus that I get.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** It's just a normal attack roll, right?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** It's a normal attack roll.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Okay.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** So, f*** me.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** It's like 10.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** I hate melee attacks.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Does that do anything?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** It does not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** You miss.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** What about Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** It's like a 19 to hit.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Right?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** What is AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** I'm not sure what AC was, but it was hot.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** It's pretty hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** Yeah, it's impossible is what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** What about Bernice's attack for opportunity?

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** The knife's just going to fly out.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** The knife flies out to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** From like an articulated arm?

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Oh, three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** Three.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Plus four, so seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:43]** Yeah, so all the AOs missed, but as you inject, the robot does seem to be off balance, and that allows you to make an AO.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:49]** Unfortunately, all of you missed, but you did do 16 points of damage, and the ACs are lower, which again, freaking sucks.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Great.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** Very, very necessary.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Here's, it is your turn.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** End of round two.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** We're getting to one round every episode.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** Here's, what are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Here's tries to attack yet again.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** And so that's going to be a mother...

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** I hate this spell.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** It doesn't hit.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Let's put it that way.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** You did it.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** You tried to do nanobots again?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** Yes.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** I... Yes.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** I mean, I have a plus five to my melee attacks.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** You know what?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** Like, this is... And I'm not going to be able to hit this thing either.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Yes, you can.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:27]** Here's moves away from a... Yes, you can with a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** He just did his attack.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** He now will move towards the computers over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** Okay.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Guarded step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Guarded step?

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Yeah, guarded step.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Okay, so take a five-foot step away.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Okay.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** All right.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** All right.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** It is going to be the top of round three.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Rick19, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** Well, Rick will swing again and probably miss.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Come on.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Do you want to guess?

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Do you want to guess what I just got?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Do you get a 20?

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:02]** I'm pretty sure I just have this octopus-shaped thing on some of my dice.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** I think it's called a kraken.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Here.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** I'm going to do an imitation of Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** That means 20, right?

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Oh, this game's so hard.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Oh, I can't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** I was like, oh, I can't hit it unless I get a natural 20.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** No.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Natural 20 doesn't happen every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** So pull a card.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Pull a card.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** All right.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** You said pull a card.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Here we go.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** I roll damage twice.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** All my bonuses.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Yes.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Both times.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:28]** So my damage is a 1d12.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** So roll once.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Add your thing.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Plus five.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** 11 points of damage?

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** And still spinning.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** 16 points of damage.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Wow.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** So that's now, what, 27?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:46]** 27 points of damage.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** 27 points of damage.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:50]** Dude, describe how you swing and hit.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:57]** So, like, he came down with, like, he missed with the shaft, and then he kind of tried to, like, push forward with the rest of the, like, bar it.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:06]** And then he just kind of draws back, and he just swings like a baseball bat, swings his axe around.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** Because, like, Hears is out of the way now, so, like, he just swings it.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Boom.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Right across the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Three, two, one.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Stop.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** To the thinky bits.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Crit effect.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** The target moves two steps down the intelligence poison track.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** Fortitude saved to end each round.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:32]** It is immune to poison as a construct, so I don't think it will take anything from that, unfortunately.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** It's so funny.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:40]** You still did 27 points of damage, and it looks like some of the plates have been moved.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:44]** You can see circuits and wires are short-circuiting.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** You can see that across the visor, it is saying...

**[00:40:48 - 00:41:04]** error error error as you've like started to like mess with some sub systems it's yeah it only took a natural 20 that's that's all yeah just that it is going to be the robot's turn

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** I will tell you guys something that I just read and remembered.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** This thing's invincible and it will never die.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** It has vulnerability to critical hits.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:19]** So each of your critical hits did an extra half, like 50% damage.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:23]** So that means that, Rick, yours did an extra 13 damage.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Okay.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:47]** so with dr okay's hit it did half again so it's five it's at 16 total and then rick with yours you did 13 it had 17 hp left and you hit 18 thank god and the creature sorry sorry so it had 17 left when i did my attack

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:57]** Well, it technically would have had... The point is that, Rick, you hit it with your axe hammer, and it falls to the ground dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** It's an axe, and it just chops its head off.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** And you chop its head off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** It flies across the room, hitting here.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** It's killing the baby.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** Kevin is still upset.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** These ACs are ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** So let me just walk you through this.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:17]** As it dies and falls to the ground to pieces, this thing is a gatekeeper robot.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:20]** Vulnerability to critical hits, vulnerable to electricity.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** So I was thinking maybe here's where I'd have thrown out the Electrovor.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** You could have dealt more damage.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** Again, you can figure this out with, you know, what do you call it?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** With life science.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:37]** It had 70 HP, so it had a lot, but...

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:41]** It had EAC of 17, KAC of 19.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** You reduce those by two, Doctor.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Okay, so it's 15, 17.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:49]** So all of you at level four probably have some attack bonus that would allow you to hit it.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** Again, it's not always going to be like right on the money, but I'm not going to lie.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** You're level four and you're in book two of an adventure path.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Creatures are going to have higher ACs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:18]** man i don't know about this though i don't know if i just built my character completely wrong but like i only have a plus five to physical tax and i should have done life science i guess it's sort of great like my my range attacks are like a plus eight so like it's a little bit better but like not a whole lot i don't know i don't know but as it falls

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** We're just all terrible players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** It's fine.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:37]** Let me just remind you that as it falls and the head hits the ground, the body counter rotates as the wheel goes one way, the torso falls the other, crashes into the metal in front of you.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:44]** You're standing near these poles that look like they're probably about four of them.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:48]** There's a metal collar attached between two of each one.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:52]** And there are all these cuffs running down the length on both sides.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Looks like maybe they're meant to restrain somebody.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** Maybe this creature normally...

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:05]** would be told to knock you out and put you... Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Sorry.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** The room that we're in is where the calls unit is that we hear the hailing signals from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Yeah, I was getting to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** And there's four poles in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** You're standing next to them, right next to where the creature is.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** That we're supposed to hold a creature of some sort?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** They could.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** It would restrain us?

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:33]** Maybe this creature typically would knock you out and restrain you in the poles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Oh, I see what you're saying.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:43]** So it's not that there was a creature here that got free, it's that the guardian creature would hit us and lock us up in these poles.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Okay, sorry, I misunderstood.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:52]** I was picturing something like the troll thing that we were talking about that was stomping through the other rooms got free from this room.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Yep.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** And I was like, that doesn't make any sense to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:00]** And the comm is over at the console.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:07]** You can see the lights on roll 20 that would be flashing and the side of the console that is destroyed.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** What do you all want to do?

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Dr. K is still outside the open door.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Rick's in the corner.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Here's is in the middle of the room.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Bernice is a suitcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** Can we examine, do a life science check on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:26]** here's is gonna go up and try to access the Communication thing and listen to the communications.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:47]** Oh, yeah Rick kind of slams his his axe down and is like leaning on it because he's pretty beat up and he's just gonna say first I want to say that I do believe Nico would be very impressed by your briefcase robot and secondly, I I need to take a rest and

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** And he's going to take a 10 minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Okay.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Is anyone else taking a rest?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** I'm not taking a 10 minute rest now.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** And yeah, no rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Okay.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** So here's not taking a rest.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Rick is taking a rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Dr. K, what are you doing?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:12]** Going to have help here is with the communications and have Bernice like examine construct.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Okay.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Lifeless construct or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Yeah, it's a robot.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** So Bernice goes over to examine it.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** What did you want to know about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** What caused the modification of it?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** It looks like somebody went in.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** You think it's probably...

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Was it evil?

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:34]** Could I know anything about the intent behind or motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:40]** Yeah, I'll say that during the 10 minutes, you're able to go and look at some of the programming, boot up what you can or read through it.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:45]** It seems like the robot, typically, the slam attack that it does would be non-lethal.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** It would have targeted to knock creatures out.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:53]** However, specifically, the slam that the robot does was modified to be lethal.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** Now, the robot does have an injector pistol

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** and a nigh-fiber net.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:10]** So at a certain point, it looks like it was targeted that once it knocked one of you out lethally... What kind of injection?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Is it like a weapon?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:17]** Yeah, it has an injector pistol to shoot, and it has sedatives that it would use.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:27]** So it looks like it was programmed to kill at least one creature, and any other creatures it would then subdue and lock in these poles.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Okay.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Typically, it would just subdue everybody.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** Is it advanced or more advanced than what I got?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** It has an integrated zoologist injector pistol.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** Could I modify Bernice or give it to her?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:59]** uh if you want to i think we would need to look into the drone stuff to see what it would take for you to give that those weapons to uh well there are 20 doses of tier one sedative you can take that you can also take the sedatives you can take the injector pistol you can take the knife fiber net okay

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** I would take them.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** Okay.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:06]** So you take the sedatives, which essentially do 1d4 non-lethal damage when they're hit.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Do you take the nifiber net?

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Can I see the stat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Can you post it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** Can I read it?

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:22]** Created from specialized nylon fibers that contract in response to struggle, nifiber nets are weighted along the edges to more effectively entangle their targets.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** Kev, what do you think?

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:27]** Pistol, I think, might be tough because it's integrated into the robot.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** So I think you would need to do an engineering check to pull it out.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** The Nye fiber net is just its own thing.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** You can take that if you want.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Can I roll an Nye fiber?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Nye fiber?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Nye fiber.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** N-Y fiber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** N-Y.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Yeah.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** It's made of nylon fibers that are specialized.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Is that for restraining creatures?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** If you use it against a creature, then you would essentially...

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** You would throw it, and they would become entangled.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** They would gain the entangled condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** A successful what type of throw?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Just a ranged attack.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Okay, yeah, I'll take it.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Put it in my Starfinder backpack.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Yeah, it looks like it doesn't do any damage.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** You just throw it.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** I'm going to guess it's a thrown weapon.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Probably ranged attack bonus.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:20]** If it hits, it hits them.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** They're entangled.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** They're entangled.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** That's cool.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Yeah, it's pretty neat.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Pretty cool.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Kevin, why are you smiling?

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** No reason.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** I figured.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** So...

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Dr. O'Kay.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** And here's... Dr. O'Kay, you're... Bernice is going through, pulling all this out.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** You're pulling out the tier one sedative.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Pulling out all this stuff.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** I'll pull out the tier one sedatives.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** Okay.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Here's... You walk over to the communications.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** You see that there are a couple comms.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** There are a couple messages coming.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:58]** You call them up.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** They appear to be in Aklo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** You know Aklo, right?

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Uh... Dr. Okay?

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** Yeah.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Okay.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** So Rick glances up and then goes back to resting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** So does Bernice.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** He tells that to Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** He's like, I think you'll know how to read this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Okay.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Come on over.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Okay.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Check it out.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** There are

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Three messages.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:31]** Looks like they've been sent over the course of the past few hours.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:37]** One came in within an hour, but the others have come in over the past few hours.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Let's say the past eight hours.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** So, you call them up.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:50]** This display comes up from the center of the console.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** A little camera.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Projects.

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:08]** And you see a thin, pale woman, her brown hair shaved in a modern fashion on the sides and left long on the top.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** But you can see her ears, and they're pointed and tattooed, maybe painted.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** You can't quite tell.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:20]** Under her right eye in gold is the symbol of Waden.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:28]** There are gold piercings that decorate the opposite eyebrow, the nose, and the lip.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:37]** You can see that her voice and her demeanor is stern.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:43]** As she begins to talk, her chin lifts up and the screen rotates a little bit.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** And you can see her neckline.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** And she's wearing light combat armor.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** with the Steward symbol on the collar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:02]** And she says, This is Steward Ops Special Agent Nala Yalamis.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:08]** Your operation has been identified as the source of illegal activity from PacWorld Space.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** Surrender and you will not be further harmed.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** Please transmit compliance on this frequency.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Oh, well, we're learning something.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** That means we're on a ship at least.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Looks like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** Oh, my God.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Oh, my God.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Amazing.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** See you next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** I am so relieved to know that the stewards are handling this.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:42]** They are a true beacon of hope in our galaxy, and their involvement only confirms my suspicions that we have stumbled into something very nefarious.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** I hope that we'll be able to communicate with them that we are the victims here and are in no way involved in what's going on.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** With their help, we might actually make it out of this alive.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:57]** As always, thank you to Paizo, Hero Lab, Roll20, and Sirenscape.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** And especially thank you to our listeners.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** Join us again next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** Rick19, out.
