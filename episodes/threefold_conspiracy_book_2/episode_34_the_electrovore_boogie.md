## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:09]** Last time on We'll Save, our adventurers passed through the southern door to find a blue-hued corridor.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:19]** Amongst the scattered ruins, our group was able to salvage a food synthesizer and some parts for future use.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:23]** Our group also discovered two mysterious doors in the hallway.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:32]** After some debate about which door they should go through and how they should enter, Nico finally lost patience and barged in.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:34]** What he found was horrifying.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:41]** Clearly the result of experimentation, a monster pulled its form together and attacked Nico.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** Is this the end of the line for Nico?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:46]** Hello and welcome to the game show we'll save.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Let's say hi to the audience.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:53]** Where's the audience?

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** It's great to be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** We're a joke first.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:02]** I just don't know how to use this cue set up right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** I've just never cued a fake audience before.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** Do you still have Huelhauser?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** So Huel's gone for now.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Oh, that's sad.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** That's really sad.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Thank God I don't have to listen to a dog eating avocado.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** I'm an avocado eating dog.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** That's one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Will's gotten pretty good at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** I'm a dog eating avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:23]** Every time you played, I grudgingly laughed.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** We don't need the actual audio clips.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** We can just do it ourselves.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** We'll just do it ourselves.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:40]** If there's ever a straight-to-DVD life story of Fuelhauser that needs somebody to do voiceover, come talk to me.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** It's probably going to be you.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** It's probably going to be you.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Or the star.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** I'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** I love Fuel.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** You could play Fuelhauser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Just wear a Hawaiian shirt and show up places.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** Just with a microphone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** What's this over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** Oh, that's pretty good.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Wow.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** Actually, Will, you would do a really good Mr. Garrison impression.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** I probably could.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I haven't worked on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Hey, speaking of impressions...

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Oh, yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** Oh, God, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** How would you like to go see the school counselor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** I do like Kuhlhauser, though.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** I never heard of him until those samples.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Oh, man, his show was so good.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** California Gold.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:28]** He just traveled all over California looking at weird stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** We're here today in Santa Cruz.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** to look at a cement boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:38]** The reason why... It's always some bullshit thing that no one would find interesting.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** But he weaves a beautiful tale around it.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** It makes it amazing.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** It's so worth it.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** He said, wow, so a family of frogs used to live in there?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Or something like that?

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** And then you just go on that for like 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:54]** My favorite part about it was whenever he covered something that like, because my dad would watch it all the time when I was like a kid.

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:00]** And so like whenever he covered something that like I've been to in my short life, I'm like, oh my God, I know that stuff.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:05]** He did the Calico Ghost Minds or something one time and I was like, oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yeah.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:12]** One of the best episodes is the Baghdad Cafe episode, if you ever guys want to check it out.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** It's hilarious.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:18]** He was very unwelcome in the Baghdad Cafe, and so everyone was just trying to get him to leave, but he wouldn't leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** He was just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** I don't want to give too much away, but please check it out.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Everyone looks so depressed behind them in the camera.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Where is the Baghdad Cafe?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** It's in the middle of fucking nowhere, like everything in California is gold.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:37]** It's somewhere in the almost Death Valley area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** That is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** It's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** You know where is the middle of nowhere is like Salvation Mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Have you been there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Yeah.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** That is.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** Yeah, that is.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** I know where it is.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Salt and Sea, right?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Yeah, that's near the Salt and Sea.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** The May Mate Sea that's drying up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Salt and Sea, I'll probably go there this summer.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Yeah.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** They have like cool dunes and stuff out there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** Yeah, but go to Salvation Mountain.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:58]** Wait, when you say this summer, are you saying in this month or next month?

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** Yeah, next month is the fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** That's a really good question.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** It's probably going to be the winter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Wait, September I thought was the last month of summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** What does the audience think about Kelly's foible there on the fall summer?

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Well, we'll never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** Actually, it's probably really hot there, so screw it.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** I'm not going to go in the summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** The last day of summer is September 22nd.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Booyah!

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** Nailed it.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** It was right.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** No, today.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** Today is... Wink, wink.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** It's today.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Today is the last day of summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Kelly lies to Salton Sea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:33]** Kelly... Lies to Salton Sea.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Are we doing this intro over again?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Yeah.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Really?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Because we completely just fucked that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** It's too long, though.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** What?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** No, all of our intros are at least this long, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** It's been about four minutes since I started the timer, and I started the timer as soon as we...

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** I still think we should do the whisper thing.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** So yeah, I was like, we could do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** We can always jump to it.

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Yeah.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** I mean, that's fine.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:05]** Intro part two is intro part two.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** Let me change the music.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** Oh, see, it's a different... Oh, yeah, it's the intro part two.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** Welcome to We'll Save Intro Part Two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** The music just starts over again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** That's funny.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** In front of... Filmed in front of a live studio audience.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Hey!

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** You did it again!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:56]** don't worry i got a post no i'll just leave all the posts like i always do kelly lead us oh yeah so i was looking up on one of those websites um and wow this is off to a great start but basically there's a lot of websites out there one of those websites dads for some reason and i i hate them usually but there was one really good post and it was about how things to say when you're saying goodbye to someone and you're hugging them and you just whisper into their ear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** You want to be, like, creepy about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Yeah, it has to be.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:06]** So, like, one of them was, and I told them already, so you might have to cue the laugh track for this because they've already heard it.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:10]** But, like, it's, like, I killed Mufasa.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** There you go.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** And the second one was...

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** There was another one that was like, where you're just like, help.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** And then you just like step away and you're just happy.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** You're just smiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** You just like go about your business.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** Like a Florida man on a semi-truck windshield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, that was a crazy video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** So good.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** But Nick had one, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I thought of one.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** I was just like...

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** Don't look.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Go downstairs.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** Make a left.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** A door will appear.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Walk through.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:47]** He'll be waiting for you.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** That is a good one.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** That's good.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:57]** I also have one, which is, just so you know, I, for one, am very happy that you're here.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** And then step away.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** So sad.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** That's really good and really soul crushing for that person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Yeah, it's very soul crushing.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** That's a good one.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I could only go really dark.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Please.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** You smell much better when you're awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** Very nice.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** That's a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Wow, that is good.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** You got to chime in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Sorry, I'm in like nerd mode right now.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** All I can think is like, I rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** So many questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** You step away, you have a full erection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Ouch.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** That's a big natural one, I think, right?

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Not a natural 20.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** It depends on the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:52]** Well, I think part one was more successful of the intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Part two was also good.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Part two was actually really good.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** We just need to bring back Kuhlhausner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Oh.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** Kuhlhausner?

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Kuhl's half-brother?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** I'm Kuhlhauser.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** That was a strange, strange conversation.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** Here, wait, hold on.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** I got one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Yeah, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** I saw an avocado-eating dog.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** You've got to say it with his voice.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Whisper again.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:20]** I saw an avocado-eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** I saw a dog eat an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** Will, what sampler?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** Will was ready to play that sample.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** His finger was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:37]** It's a really weird sounding cricket, though.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** Yeah, it's like a sad cricket.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I don't like this cricket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** It's a sad cricket.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:51]** You know what would be terrible, though, is if you had all of our laughs and all of our ahs and all of our oohs on loops, and then it just caught us off guard.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:54]** We would hear ourselves going, aww.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:03]** yeah pretty much have all of our that classic phrases on yeah that would be creepy and then you could just have them play the podcast and we'll go yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** We'll save the first AI podcast.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Then we'd really all be murdered by it.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Completely run by AIs.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** That's called passive income, everybody.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** That's passive income.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Yeah, it really reduces our time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** All we do is edit it.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:23]** I mean, if I could train an ML model to recreate our voices, we could just... Our productivity would go through the roof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Yeah, we'd get through episodes.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** I don't even have to show up.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Yeah.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Well, until that day, I think we should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:36]** There it is.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** All right.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Thanks, everyone.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:40]** We'll be right back after this break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** Cool.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Do you guys remember at all?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Do you have a memory of what happened last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** I was just told before we started that Nick was about to die.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** That's what I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Yeah, like always.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** There is a thing.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** But let's go real quick.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** You escaped a...

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:06]** burning, exploding ship in the middle of a controlled environment via some escape pods.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** Honestly, when I thought about it, I was like, just hours ago, it feels like, right?

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:14]** I mean, that you landed, I think you rested, so it was really the time scale of hours.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:24]** And then you land in an unfamiliar, sterile environment, the very foundation of which, as you exit, egress the escape pods.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** The foundation shakes and groans with stress.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:54]** You start to work your way past security robots, the decontamination chamber, only to find a small control room with the bodies of three greys, small humanoid aliens that were previously only spoken about in deep infosphere forums or as rumors among long-haul starship crews or scary stories to misbehaving children.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Their overly large heads had a hole blown in back of them.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:12]** But the computer that they're near is just intact for you to find some information about nearby rooms and the grisly, inhumane, and demonic experiments held in them.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** So you venture into one to the south.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** Two doors to the north, two doors to the south.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** Sorry, one door to the north, two doors to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Can we see this on roll 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:46]** so you venture into one of them you find a i think crickets would have been better there goo all over the walls


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:47 - 00:13:00]** And you also find large shattered test tubes when, out of nowhere, there's some sort of a troll goo thing that attacks.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:08]** Now, knowing that there are some items of value in here, you linger to fight.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:17]** As the goo climbs up the wall and attacks Nico with a crazy weird gooey morphed arm.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** And I think I rolled a 26.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:26]** Let me move you guys over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** To the map, to the map, to the map, to the map.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** You scroll down.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** Flying first class up in the sky on a jet plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** Living life on a fast plane.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Oh man, what are these glowing things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** That's like... So there are two types of goo in this room.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** One is like glowing green.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** That's what you saw.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** That's like Pew's...

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** goo, but it's also kind of red.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:56]** And then there's another goo that is in these shattered test tubes.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:07]** But Nick, the point of this story is that Nick, right now, you are about to... Can I do a life science on the other goo to see if they're good goo versus bad goo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Yeah, pretty much.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** It's not your turn.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Damn it.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Perhaps on your turn you can.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I don't even have life science.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** That was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** No one heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** You should point it out to me.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** That was so good.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** The only person that heard that was Kelly.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** No, I heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:33]** We're trying to, for the audience, we're trying to be less interrupting of each other, so I'm trying to laugh on the side.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** It was very funny, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:40]** Nick is just laughing right into the mic, grabbing all of it.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Zero fucks given.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:44]** He's laughing at the mics on his own jokes that nobody else heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Nick, I'm very sorry about this.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** This is going to hurt, buddy.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** You take 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** I mean, I told you goo was going to be coming out the other end for me.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** So there are now three different types of goo in the room now.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** There are three different types of goo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Jeez.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Wow.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** You said 13 points of damage?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** 13 points of damage.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:10]** And I'm going to need you to make a reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Oh, John, you're a real special character.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Did I ever tell you that?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Yeah.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** You're like a real treat.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Just absolutely very.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** That's what they call me.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** You said 13?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:23]** Rick wants to roll perception to see how close to death Nico is.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** 14 of 22.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** I rolled a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** Say again?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** I'm 14 out of 22 hit points and no stamina.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Ooh.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** With three resolve points.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** There we are.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** So we got to do a reflex saving throw here.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:52]** Yeah, because as it hits you, you feel the force of this arm, this goo slam into your chest, but then it stays on your chest and it starts to like spread as if it's trying to entangle you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:57]** So we're now talking about a fourth type of goo here that might be coming up the throat hole.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Okay.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Yeah, geez.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** No, no, no.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** I was referring to vomit.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Damn it.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** There it is.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Gosh.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** That was a highbrow vomit joke, and come on.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** There is no highbrow vomit joke.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** That was a highbrow vomit joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Oxymoron right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** That's 18 plus whatever my reflex is.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** As it starts to spread, you're like, no, not today, not today.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** You start to like...

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:29]** You grab it, and it feels kind of like Play-Doh, but then also it's kind of porous a little bit.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:33]** So maybe your fingers start to get inside, but you're able to kind of wrench it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** 18 plus 7, so 25.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** You easily push it off.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** You really crush that.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Will, you were saying something?

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** Like the consistency of sourdough starter.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Like the consistency of sourdough.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Funny, this is a sourdough goo.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** All right, that I'm pretty sure.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** I'd like to do a life science check on that.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:00]** So this thing is on the wall on the other side from Nico, and that's how it hit.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:01]** What is it going to do?

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** It tried to hit Nico.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** I think it is pretty intense.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** It hit Nico, couldn't quite grab on.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:11]** I think that is its turn.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** We are now on, I believe, round dos.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:19]** Back at the top of the round, it is Dr. OK throwing it over to you.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** What are you thinking here?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:25]** You are, for all the listeners, Dr. Okay, Nico, and Hears are all outside.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Nico's in the doorway.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** Rick is on the other side of the room.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:33]** And Rick, and I think it's Rick and Nico have dealt damage to this thing so far.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:41]** But as we talked about last time, the damage, both shots seem to, it seemed to like kind of regenerate some of it with each shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** So we're fighting Majin Buu right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Me, you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Oh no, Majin Buu is, he's, he's.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Boo yeah, boo yeah.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** No, that's regular boo.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** He becomes a good guy.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** We can convert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** We don't really know anything about this creature.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Sorry, Robo?

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** We don't really know anything about this creature as of right now.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Do we not know anything?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Do we know anything about this creature at this moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Last episode, you did a life science check.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:09]** You saw that it was some sort of... It clearly has troll DNA in it.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** There's some sort of troll, but it's clearly not a full actual troll.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** But you could do...

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Did you do a life science check last time?

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** I think you did.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** And you were asking if there were any weaknesses, but I don't think you met.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** You didn't get high enough to get it.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** That's why you don't know much.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** And Skyrim trolls don't like fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** But you guys did hit with fire damage.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** And I liked it.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** No, no, no.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** I asked him with laser pistol.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** While it does have fire damage, I didn't do any fire damage to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** That's only on a crit.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** So it was just like laser damage.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Yeah.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Okay.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** But that was also Kev's damage was also laser damage.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Right, Kev?

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Yes.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Yeah.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** Okay.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Wait.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** So are we saying we think that there's some kind of defense against fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** Either way, the damage it took, it clearly started.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:06]** It didn't all go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** So you're saying we need Sozin's Comet?

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:15]** Do we want to continue fighting this or just close the door on it and see if it stays inside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** I think if I remember correctly, that was our plan.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Rick is inside with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Rick is inside.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Bye, Rick.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Also, there were two things.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Bye, Rick.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** You were going to do this last time.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** That was your MO.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:31]** And then I had either told you or I was reminding you or I was telling you for the first time.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:45]** Either way, there were one, the type of goo that was in the test tubes with a different type of goo, not the same that this one is made of, and that there also seemed to be some sort of a bag or something near one of the test tubes.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:51]** So there are things in here, and you would know that, and you would remember that from the information that you grabbed.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Okay, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:59]** Yeah, I remember Rick was ready to vacate the room, and then for whatever reason, we were like, no, we're going to fight it.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** And so that's when Rick dove against the other wall and tried to flank it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Got it.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Okay, then.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I really don't know what to do.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** I can't go into the room because it's blocked, right?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:15]** You could move through, I think, Nico's square.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Okay, but I can't really see where I'm moving.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** So can I, like... Drop, yeah.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** But this is going to incur attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** No, it's only if you leave a threatened square.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** Well, if you leave a threatened square... Or she ranged.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Yeah.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:34]** But I'm pretty sure if you leave a threatened square, even into another threatened square, right?

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** We've talked about that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** Oh, you're saying if you pass through that threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** If I pass through two threatened squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:46]** If you pass through one threatened square into another threatened square, you do incur an attack for opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Right.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** You could take it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** And I have partial covering.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** I could, like, see him right now fire through the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:59]** Yeah, I would say that because Nico's standing there, the troll thingy will have solid cover.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** A little bit of SC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:21]** fight on okay so i'm just gonna i'm gonna shoot him then take this fell uh goo 14 to hit 14 to hit uh rules lawyer is soft cover plus two


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Thanks.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Pause.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Oh, it's pause plus four.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:33]** So just as you go to fire, Will, you have it right in your sights.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:41]** And just as you fire, Nico, trying to push this thing off of him, accidentally bumps your gun, flies wild into the room.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** You were close.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** Do you want to at least move in to pull some heat off Nico?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Do you want to...

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** Why would I want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** I don't know.

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:01]** I could stay here and I could stabilize or give him a medicine check, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** Don't forget that you can also do a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** I just want to say, like, I'm the rules lawyer, but I'm also a very slow reader.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** So, like, hey, I just found soft cover.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** It's cool.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** I'm just in the 21st century cat.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** So I just Googled it.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** So that's fine.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** But a guarded step.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:24]** I can't step paper.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:31]** You could move in and then next round, if you want, you, you would take a guarded step as your, uh, I think as your move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Right.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** But okay.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** I'm just going to stay put and be the buff.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Cause I don't need to jump into a situation.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Don't jump in.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** I can apply first aid.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** You're going to apply first aid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Sure.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** I think I can.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:53]** I can do double... I already attacked, so I can also do... That was your standard action?

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** So could you aid as a move action?

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** I'm going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** So I could use... Yeah.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** I'll attempt a medicine check for standard action.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:11]** Use medicine to stop bleed damage or administer first aid to a dying creature that you can touch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Oh, but he's not dying.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Also, that's a standard action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Yeah.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** I don't think I can do anything right now.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:22]** You don't have any healing serums or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Why'd you do the shotgun sound for that one?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** Am I shotgunning this healing serum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:39]** I want to use a first aid kit for... Actually, I don't even see it in my inventory, though.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** I know we had some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I feel like you have some.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** It's in your costa jet.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** You can use that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** No, it's not in the cost of jet.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** I can give him a booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** I can give him the booster.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** Fire the booster to get on through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** Find them avocado-eating dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Find them avocado-eating dogs.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** Hey, Nico, that looked like a close hit.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:06]** I think, do you want some of this juice here for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** Only if you call it by its right name, Death Sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** It's just juice.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** It's the juice.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** It's literally just mango pineapple juice.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** I don't think I really actually had a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Yeah, to give it to him, I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:31]** You get a plus one bonus to your AC for four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** Nice.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** That is nice.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** That is the teamwork that we like to see.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Right, audience?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** Which one is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:43 - 00:25:05]** all right fantastic that is the teamwork here's it's your turn what are you doing you're even further away yeah from this creature correct yeah uh do i need to roll perception again to figure out exactly where it is um or can do i remember no i think you would know where is it

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** Oh, it's right there on the... If you look on the big... It's that little green blob.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** You know that it's right in front of Nico to the left on the other side of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** Oh, it's next to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** It's this... Oh, I don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Oh, it's because it's out of my field of vision.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** That's why I got it.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** So, okay.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Use your blind sense.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** Here's knows where it is.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Use the force.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:32]** So, here's is going to throw out the Electrovor.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:35]** So, you should... Can you cue up the Pokemon music?

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:49]** oh however much we can legally get away with all right so five seconds

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** All right, so he throws that out.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** Gotta catch him!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I love it.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Gotta catch him!

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Pokemon!

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** I think that you need to do... Wait, where are you throwing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** I'm going to throw it into the room over Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:07]** Okay, then I would just probably... Is there a thrown object or an improvised thrown object?

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** Or is it like a grenade where you just basically have to not fail?

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** It's like AC5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:15]** It should say it on the item, doesn't it?

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** It says thrown like something...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:26]** Also, you have a forward build cap that you can just switch immediately to going backwards as you throw this.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** What is your item called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** What's up?

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** What is your item called?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** It's called Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** That's the creature that comes out, but what is the name of the item?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** I think it's just called Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** Obsidian Electrovor Figurine of Wondrous Power?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Told you, it's a figurine.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:26:45 - 00:27:10]** uh improvised thrown weapon i think for this you just need to make sure that you don't fail that's my thought i feel like yeah it's like your grenade you the the square you want to hit is ac5 but i mean i can if it's within your range is ac5 and then or it's it's ac whatever yeah and then if and then if you fail then you would do the whole randomize which where did it actually go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:17]** And then you can also take, we don't need to worry about it now, but you can also take penalties to throw it further than what, it's like minus five for every five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Yeah, I feel like it's 20 feet is the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:25]** But like, here's is enough of not a terrible thrower to like get it into the room, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:30]** Yeah, just, you're basically just rolling it to make sure that you don't throw it and then it bounces off Nico's head.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** All right, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** What do I need to roll for that 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:38]** D20 and then you would add whatever I think you would add, probably your dex per range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** What if he just rolled it five hole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** He's just not a scrub.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** But all right, he'll roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** What if he just went five hole with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** What does five hole mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Between the legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:50]** You got to make sure that you don't actually... What if you step last second, Nico?

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** Ding, ding, ding.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Goes down the hall.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, you're going to do that with my 25 reflex save, aren't you?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Dude, your 25 reflex save was awesome.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** But if he fails, then yeah, it sounds like... What happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** I actually don't know where I have... I don't know if I have dex bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:07]** Whatever you would add for... You could also just set the figurine down.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:07]** Yeah.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** I'm just going to, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** I mean, either way.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** You're probably not going to fail.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** It's AC5.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** I can command it.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** It's 20.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Okay, then you're fine.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Yeah, then you're fine.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** So where did you want to throw it?

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Right in front of Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:25]** Actually, to be honest, I'm going to throw it like right in front of Rick because I wanted to maintain some distance from this blob thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** That's fine.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** That's 20 feet exactly.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:32]** And I feel like, I think your grenade is ranged 20 feet typically and everything after that you take a minus.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** So it's perfect.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Okay, cool.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Excuse me.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** You nail it.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:39]** You throw it, and it just... Nice.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** It comes out right in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Brilliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:51]** Electrobor, a statue-type Pokemon, can react immediately on his turn.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Professor Oak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** All right, cool.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** So, okay.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** So what I'm getting, what, that was good.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** So, um, all right.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** So now I'm going to command Electrovor.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** I say Electrovor, use electrical discharge.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Actually, it doesn't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** Electrovor, use electrical discharge.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Electrovor.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** Electrovor, go.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:20]** That's how it sounds.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Electrovor.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** Can you add lightning sounds to that, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Absolutely.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** That is amazing.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** That is awesome.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** All right, so how does electric discharge work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:36]** That's an avocado-eating electrovore there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** That's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** This is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Oh, wait, what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:49]** It says all creatures within 10 feet of the electrovore take 1d6 plus 2 electricity damage and are staggered for one round, and Rick is within that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** That sounds about right.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** Half the time Pikachu is shocking the crap out of Batch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** He didn't know his own strength.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** Look, I'm a new Pokemon trainer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** This is my first Pokemon.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** I don't get a reflex save or anything?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Is there a reflex save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Yeah, you can attempt.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** The target can attempt a DC 13 reflex.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:17]** Save to take half this damage and negate the standard effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** I already got that.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** We're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** I rolled a 10 with a plus 5.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** You weren't in the 10-foot range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** I'm not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Nico, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** What did you roll?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** A 10 plus 5?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** You're okay, but you have to take half damage, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Damn you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** I know.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** 1d6 plus 2, so I'll roll that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** This thing got a...

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** Electroborn, return!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** Son of a... Alright, whatever.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** 1d6 plus 2.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:44]** I don't have my physical dice right now, so... Do you want some physical dice?

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Yeah, sure, thank you.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:53]** Alright, it's 7, so half of that... When we're cutting damage in half, do we round it up, down, or do we flip?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Always round down.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Okay, so he only takes like 3 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** It's half damage of the total damage, right?

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** So you rolled a what?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** 7, so you both take 3 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** 7 plus 2...

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** No, no, no.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** The total damage is seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Oh, okay.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** So three.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** Even then, you notice that not all of it goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** To that creature?

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** To that goo.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** What do you mean through?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Like it doesn't absorb it or get hit by it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:23]** It shocks, and then whatever part was burned, it just... Some of it stays burned, but some of it doesn't, as if it is regenerating.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** Boo-yah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** Boo-yah!

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** Jeez, that sucks.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Well, we learned a valuable lesson.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Yes, boo-yah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:35]** We're going to call this glob creature Majin Buu here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** That's fine.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Well done, though.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** So, Rick, you take three points of damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** I took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Sorry, Rick.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:51]** But there's now this super cool Electrovor creature in the room, lighting up the room.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Rick, what are you going to do?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** You just got shocked by Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Well, I forgot this thing exists, so I'm going to shoot the Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** You're going to shoot the Electivore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** It just attacked me.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** Rick, you know you're not a dumbass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** You know that it exists.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:09]** It's only been less than a day since it came out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:13]** All right, here's said, hey, Rick, sorry.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** That's my Electivore.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Please don't kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** It's still my turn, and you didn't.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** So don't kill my Electivore.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn, Pierce?

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Bitch.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Bitch.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Very nice.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** So throwing something is a move action.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** I haven't thrown things before, so how does that factor in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I would say that it's probably a standard action.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** So that's my entire turn.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** No, that's just your standard action.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** You still have your move and a swift.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** So if you wanted to move, you could move somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Can I do something?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** It's been a while.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:48]** Can I do something in exchange of my move action like attack during a move action or that's simply move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:55]** You could do another swift action because it's like you could do a move for a standard or you could do a swift for a move.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** So like you can do two swifts or you can do a move in a swift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** But a swift wouldn't be a regular attack.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:04]** It'd be something like throwing, for example, or like telling Electrobor to do something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:07]** Yeah, I mean, there's a table for swift actions.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Never done that before.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** It's all good.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Actions in combat.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** Changing your grip on a weapon.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Let's see.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Where's the table at?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Reactions.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:43]** like changing grips dropping prone yeah i just found that it's basically nothing yeah um i mean it's good for certain things yeah in like the right moment save your life that makes sense um nah nah he was just good he just he just tells kevin that's my elect for because he tells rick that's my elect for sorry it damaged you don't don't hurt it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** Okay.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Rick just glares at you.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** It's your turn, Rick.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** Rick glares at Hears from across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Hears has dark vision, so he can see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** And then he's going to take aim and fire.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** He's going to fire twice.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Yeah.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** Here we go with the first shot.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Oh, seven plus four.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Misses.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** That misses.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Hits the wall.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** It hits the Electrovor.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** The second one is a 19 plus four for 23 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Oh, yeah, that hits.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Wait, why are you shooting the Electrovor?

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** No.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** Oh, he's not shooting the creature.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Did I say the Electrovor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** Yeah.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** I didn't mean to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** And the Electrovor is down.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** No, that's it.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** Down goes Goodman!

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** No, I gotta take it to Pokemon Center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** I did say creature.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** Electro-Force is a type of creature.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** Sorry, for the first one, was that for EAC or KAC?

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Just to clarify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** You hit.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Your gun is a laser weapon, right?

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** So it would be against EAC?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** Yeah, so you hit.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** For the 11th?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** No, for the 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Got it.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** Okay.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** So now I roll myself.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** I got this big 10 dice.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I'm going to roll myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Did you go to new?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** For all listeners, this is the first session that we're doing where Kev is in Maryland.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** So did you go to Gamester?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Do I go to a game stair?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** A game store to get some new dice?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** No, no.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Check out the game landscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** I haven't.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** I haven't left the house really because, you know, stuff.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:28]** But I'm still using my fancy starfighter dice from Q Workshop.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Q Workshop.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Dope.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Wait, so what is your damage?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** My damage?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** I didn't even get to roll it yet because you got me distracted talking about dice.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** I'm going to roll my D10 plus three.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Dang.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** That's a lot of damage.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Oh, that failed.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** I got two plus three is five points of electrical damage or fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Okay.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** It's fire damage.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** It hits again.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:56]** Looks like it doesn't go all through, but for a split second, it seems like it takes longer to regenerate, but then it does regenerate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Okay.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** Jeez.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** You said it's regenerating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:06]** Yeah, it's like clearly all the damage is not going through.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It did not take five points of damage.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** It took part of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** But you said it's regenerating.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** As in like it got health back after I shot it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** Sorry, I misspoke.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** No, no, no.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** Not all the damage is going through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** If you did eight points of damage, maybe it took four.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** I was just clarifying because he said regenerate.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** You're right.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Those words came out of his mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Cool.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:32]** So whose turn is it?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Nico.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Oh, wait.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** Did you want to do anything else with your turn, Rick?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** No, that was my full attack.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** That's my full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Okay.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Thank you for attending my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** So, Rico.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Nico.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** Rico.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:49]** Rico.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:53]** Nico is going to go, hey, boo-boo.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** And he's going to do a double tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** He's going to do a double tap?

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Okay.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Shooting and doing a double tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** You're still in ranged attack, right?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Or ranged to be hit.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** And you're about to die.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** And you're going to take a full action attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Thank you.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Too late.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** You weren't taking your piece off.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** You ran off the piece.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** No, it's fine.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** You're about to die.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** You are in range.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Don't go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Don't take your back.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** Wait, I can't see where the thing is.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I didn't even know.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** I don't even know if there's a thing in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** You can feel it, though.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Look here on the TV screen.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** It's out of your field of vision.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** It's on the other side of the door and to your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** Then how is that an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Well, it's an attack of opportunity if you leave a threatened square.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** But if you do a double tap, which is actually a ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:43]** So if you do a ranged attack, that's also... Firing a ranged attack when you're that close incurs an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** But there's an obstruction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** So then how are you still hit you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** But we've also talked about, I think we talked about the rules.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** The rules of obstruction is that you, you draw a straight line from any corner.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:00]** So you technically are not covered by being adjacent like this.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** And just for everybody listening, they're basically, like, on other sides of the wall.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:12]** Like, Nick is in the doorway, and the creature is against the wall five feet over, like, one square over from Nico.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** So they are within the melee range of each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:19]** Okay, well, then, yeah, I don't want to friggin' do that.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Too late.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** You were like, pew, pew, because you're quickfire and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** I just like to shoot things and get hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:47]** can do it man so i could i couldn't take back my electric war attack same idea just just kill this thing right now all right well i rolled the two so uh natural two plus whatever to hit um it's probably not gonna hit uh let's see here might hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** I was just kidding.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** I'm not against you pulling back your attack.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** I was just picking on you.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Wait, you're going through with a double attack?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** I was just kidding, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** It's not a double attack.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** It's a double tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** But yeah, no.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** This was a ranged weapon.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** I just realized something.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** This will change the game.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** What I was saying was that, Kev, you were like, oh, is it regeneration?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** And I was like, yep.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** And then I was like, wait, let me think about that.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** And I misread it.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Damage resistance, isn't it?

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:19]** Right, no, so I totally, and this goes back to the last episode.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:24]** It does regain some of it, but it did it at the end of the turn.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:35]** And so after each time when I was like, oh, after each time you shoot, it doesn't all go through, what I meant to say was that at the top of the round, it seemed to, all the damage that you took...

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:50]** some of it went back so it is more of a regeneration thing as such i just quickly calculated the adjusted hp and i'm just going to tell you because i feel bad about messing that up it does look like it is pretty hurt


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** Wait, and you're saying it regenerates at the end of each turn?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** So it gets shot and then it regenerates?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Sorry, not their turn.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Round.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Round, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** He did say that it seemed like it was regenerating slower.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** So maybe that's happening too.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Maybe we're taking that away a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** Yeah, so I just gave you a peek behind the screen because I was like, that's a mistake.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Just going to let you guys know.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** It basically had more HP than I was like, I don't think that's right.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** So I did it correctly.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** So it does look pretty hurt, but it's still going.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** Okay.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** So...

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** That only works in your favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** All right.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** So, yeah.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** I mean, I'm still doing the double tap here.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** You will incur an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** So, I'm sorry about this.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:38]** Well, it's the ever... It's the bittersweet feeling of killing you or not.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** But...

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** I got a 16.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Did that hit?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** You do have your plus one.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Plus one.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** And that's against KAC.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** So I had 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** So that still hits.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** I'm sorry.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** That is going to be 10 points of damage.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** And give me a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** Time for the money right in there, Patty.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** It's 11.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** 11 on the reflex.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:14]** so close you feel that this that same arm comes back hits you and just starts to wrap around you as you are entangled


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Yeah.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Now you can't run away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, I'm in trouble, guys.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** Help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, you should have not taken that turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** No takebacks.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** I was joking, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** I wasn't that serious about saying no takebacks either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:33]** I mean, seriously, let that be the standard from now on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** For the sake of the rules, can we also just check?

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:41]** I think you resolve AOLs before the actual attack because I don't want to take away the fact that you might do an attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** You keep making me turn the page to look at other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** Well, I'm trying to look at Entangle, which is you move at half speed.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** You can't run or charge.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** So you can move, right?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** But you can't run or charge.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:56]** You take a minus two penalty to AC, attack, rolls, reflex saves, initiative checks, and deck space skills.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** And on your turn, you can try and get out.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** As a move action, you can try and do an acrobatics or athletics check.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** Would that have happened before my turn?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** That's what we're just checking real quick.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:09]** But I'm pretty sure that happens right before your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Screw it.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** I'm going to stick to my action.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** You're going to shoot?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Okay.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** And I've already done it, so.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** What did you roll?

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:22]** It was a two plus five for a green total of seven.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** You don't take that.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Okay.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Sorry, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:32]** He's going to shoot, and he's going to be like, not possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Oh, man.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Things are heating up.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Nico's down, guys.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** He's almost down, right?

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** You're still up?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** I'm still up.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Oh, God, Nico.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** You don't look so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** It is this creature's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** You don't look good, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** And here's the thing.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** Because the Electrovor just did a bunch of damage.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** To everybody.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:01]** Even though, well, to you, too.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:09]** The arm that hit Nico was just kind of a reactionary thing because now another arm is going to go out and hit the Electrovor because it just pulled its attention.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:15]** Oh, that is going to be... Wait, so clarification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Nico is down or he's just really hurt?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Okay.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** You're about to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** What do you say as you get hit, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I already said what I was saying.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Not...

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Possible.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** I'm quick fire, bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** It's not enough of a pause before the bitch.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** You got to do it again one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** We're feeling this right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:41]** The creature's like, not possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Sorry, you're screen froze.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Sorry, you're screen froze.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:53]** Bitch!

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** There you go.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** There it is.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** That was good.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Amazing.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** All right, that's a 28 as this arm comes out to hit the Electrovor.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Well, he has a KAC of 14, so.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Okay, so that is a hit.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** I'm going to change this music right here because this is getting intense.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** That is...

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:15]** 11 points of damage as it just slams into this electricity as it crackles around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** It gets hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Roll a reflex save, Electrovor.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Oh, okay.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Kelly's getting his super potion ready.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** It can't do that.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Wait, what'd you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** I said Kelly's getting his super potion ready.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** It's been taking a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** I'm going to capture this other creature while I'm at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Vor!

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Vor!

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Electrovor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** I'm going to say that it moved.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** And actually, as it, let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** I still need to roll my reflex save, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** Anybody feel like we just went up and tried to go kill a giant in Skyrim?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Yeah, it moved up, and it, boom, hit you.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** But it didn't even need to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Oh.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** I got a 15 on reflex for what?

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Trying to avoid it?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** Yeah, so the goo tried to, like, encapsulate the electricity, and it doesn't.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** It, like, the Electrovor's electricity kind of pushes it back.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** So Electrovor's fine?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Electrovor's not entangled.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Oh, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** But he's damaged, though.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** He's damaged.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:14]** He did take 11 points of damage, which is not insignificant.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** And that is the creature's turn.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:22]** And as that happens, as we move into round three, you see some of it try and restructure itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** And it heals.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** This is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:41]** I will say that you already made a life science check, but if one of you wants, now that you've seen this happen, if one of you wants to make a thing about this, I will let you do that because I don't want you to, like, you shouldn't be penalized just because you didn't do it the first time.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** John, on the next turn, can I voice act the troll, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Sure.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:53]** But if y'all want to make another life science check, now that you've seen this thing happen, you didn't see this the first time.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** You just saw it and were like, I don't know what this is.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:08]** But then now that you've seen it in combat for the past 12 seconds, 18 seconds, then you're like, actually, I'm going to give you guys another chance to do a life science check to figure out what's going on with this whole regeneration thing.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Okay, well then.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:19]** This strange entanglement of goo, I wonder what it could be.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** I'm going to roll life science.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** That is...

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Not bad, but not great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Oh, not bad, but not great.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:36]** Is this also, like, a genetic creature, like, experiment?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** So?

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Funny that you should ask.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:42]** Because that actually has a... I have a minus...

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:47]** 5 DC to checks with genetics, given my theme knowledge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** That makes sense.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** And I think that that's going to get you an extra thing.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** So this is what's up.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** This is a troll polyp.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:03]** It is a creature that comes from some sort of like troll blood experiment.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:09]** And it's like a mass of tissue that has this predatory awareness.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:25]** And it is definitely coming from all these experiments where, you know, clearly the experimenters tried to create some sort of troll ability or troll that would like not only like regenerate, but also would like grow into a new troll.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:36]** So it seems like if a troll got its limb cut off, you're like, oh, that limb would just turn into a new troll instead of the troll regenerating the limb, which is why this thing is a massive tissue that starts to become another troll.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:40]** But clearly they weren't that successful because this thing is like a very base creature.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** Um, so that is what this is.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:48]** They're very like base hungry, aggressive, a little mindless in that way.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** And what they do have is something called versatile regeneration.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** And when you took, there was electric damage and then there was fire damage.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** And the reason why I was like, Oh, it seems to at the time regenerate slower.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:04]** But in general, the point is that like that second part of damage seemed to do more.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Because, Dr.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:17]** O.K., you put it together and you're like, oh, I think if we did three or more energy different types in the same round or in the same turn, there was more than one energy type in the same turn.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:22]** If you overload the regeneration, it won't regenerate at the end of that turn.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Yeah.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Interesting.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:29]** And it does have this entanglement thing where, like, when you hit, it can take over.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:33]** So, like, that's why I'm having you roll over.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Take over.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Take over, like, entangle you.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:47]** That's why each time that you get hit with this, I make you roll a reflex save because when it hits, it's, like, sticky and it starts to, you know, move around your body because it's used to just morphing and cloning and becoming...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:52]** This is a fiendish creation of twisted science that I don't approve.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** I'm going to hit this guy once again.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:11]** I'm going to give him all I got with a... I'm going to just go with a basic inhibitor and try to... So it's not like a type of damage that like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** He doesn't have damage resistance.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Doesn't have damage resistance.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Has a regeneration, right?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:20]** Where it will regenerate HP.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:27]** But again, three or more energy types in a given round or more than one energy type during the same turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Sorry, question.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** Slicing versus bludgeoning, those are the same type of energy.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** What is a melee attack considered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** I think that would be like a kinetic attack.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:46]** Happy to delve deeper into this because I'm not trying to keep you guys from winning here necessarily.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** If you want to look, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:54]** Okay, well, I guess I'll step into the room.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:01]** steps past Nico, pushes past Nico into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:07]** And I'm going to say, hello, blob of polyp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Sorry, is this a new round?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** This is a new round.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Yeah, it's top of round three, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** So that would incur an attack of opportunity.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** No, because I'm moving into it, not out of it.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** You moved within the threatened.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** It says if a creature is in a threatened squared and moves or blah, blah.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:30]** I think once you were in Nico's space, you were in his threatened area.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** So I can't go from corner to corner is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Oh, I guess you could.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Yeah, I think you could.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** That's...

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** That's fine.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Technicalities.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** I'm sorry.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:43]** I'm going to give it to you because I feel like it's just it's a little too by the rules.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** If I'm like, oh, sorry, you have to step into Nico Square and then step in.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** That's like that's shitty.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** So you're fine.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:53]** But if you do a backflip through it or you could make that a guarded step.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** Signature quickfire.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** But I don't think that you need to.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** Yeah, because a guarded step takes my... That's your whole movement.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** It's five feet for your whole movement.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** Five feet of non-AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** Well, I can't use it again anyway, so I could do a guarded step.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Sure, that's fine.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** But yeah.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** I'm still going to attack.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** That's fine.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:25]** I'm going to take my tactical syringe spear and poke at you with my minor inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** That's what it says.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** Did you roll on the road?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:33]** Yeah.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:37]** It was kind of cracked, though, but I don't want to count it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** It's fine.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Roll in the thing.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:47]** Okay, that's a 19 on the die plus... You hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** 22.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** 22, yeah.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** You slam down this costa jet right into the mass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:57]** This is a tactical syringe spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Tactical syringe spear right into the mass of the creature.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Cutting through the sourdough.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** 11 points.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** What kind of damage is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:10]** This is injection piercing, I guess.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** It's a syringe spear.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** Dang, 11 points of damage.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Impressive.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** Plus, you now have...

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:38]** uh sorry basic inhibitor is what i said yeah uh and so damage resistance there's no damage resistance for this creature yeah not not for the purpose of okay so it is regeneration you take a minus two penalty to your ac dang


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Impressive.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Okay.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** I'm just going to lower right here.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** For how long?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:43]** Seven rounds.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Okay.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** All right.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Dang.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** That's great.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** 11 points of damage just right in the sourdough starter.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Sorry.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Can you say that again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** He did some minus to what?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** AC.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** That is a good move.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** That is a good move, Dr.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** O.K.,

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** You want to do anything or say anything else on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:08]** I think he should be feeling that one, guys.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Hit him with something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Okay, so that's a kinetic damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** It is here's his turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:16]** So you said that we need to roll three types of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** It's an injection, painful injection.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Right, but piercing, which is kinetic.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** But I feel like it's kinetic.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:33]** Because you literally... Yeah, so you would need to do three or more different types of energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** And then that permanently removes its ability.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Or just for the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** It's just for the round.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** This thing is crazy.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Yeah.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** We're also in book two.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** You guys are level three.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Things are, you know.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** I'm almost out of Pyrex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** I think someone's going to die in this one, all right?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** I'm worried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** I'm worried it's going to be me right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** I think it's going to be me.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** I got four points of health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Yeah, but you didn't just poke it.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** In all fairness, Nico, you should get your ass out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** I'm entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** You can still move.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** I'm entangled a little bit.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Is my understanding.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Yeah.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** I think it's a half movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:16]** You can still move and you can do your acrobatics or athletics to become unentangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** It's my turn now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Your quick fire super roll thing.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Well played, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Quick roll.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Here's... What are you thinking?

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** Quick roll.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** So here's Shouts at Electrovor.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:31]** So he's going to... Here's is going to do an attack and have Electrovor do an attack.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** All right.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** So he's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** I don't know.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** What's his attack again?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Hold on.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** I was going to say use lightning.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** All right.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Electrical discharge.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:49]** And then, like, Electrobor does that again.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** Okay.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Electrobor!

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** Now it's going to hit me and Dr. RK?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Oh, Jesus.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Damn it.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Every time.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** I'm sorry.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Oh, fuck.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:03]** Alright, no, I... I'm just being kind of dumb right now.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** No.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** He can't even headbutt.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Alright, never mind.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** I'm not doing that.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** I'm not doing that.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** That's stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** Okay, but... Where is he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** I don't see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Where's who?

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Oh.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Me.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Bring him up.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** It's, like, drawn next to me.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I feel like such a jackass now.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** I don't know why I keep forgetting this.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:25]** I'm not used to doing things that, like, damage other people.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** I'm not used to doing damage.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** I mean, I'm not used to damaging my party members.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** This is dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** It has tail slap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** It does not have tail slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** A melee attack has tail slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Oh, God, it does.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** This is Pikachu.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** There's no doubt about it.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** It's Pikachu.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** I mean, I don't know.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** What can we do?

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** Can we roll a thing to see if Electrovor ignores me?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** I mean, Pikachu does ignore Ash half the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** I would love that.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** I would love nothing more than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Okay, so I guess we could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** It's not a Pokemon.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** It's from the figurine.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** You control this thing.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** It's yours to control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** All right, so what's happening?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Did I actually go through with that?

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Are we committing to this, or can I walk this back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Well, there is an advantage.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** It's got a different type of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Yeah, that was my thinking, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** So, I mean, maybe we all have to go through some pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Go for it!

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:22]** Dr. K shouts, stabbing the sourdough.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Such a badass.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** Shoot her!

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** Shoot her!

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:31]** Okay, so... All right, so that's... What is it, then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Jurassic Park references.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Stepbrothers 2008.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** He has to do a saving throw, I guess.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Everyone... What is it?

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Reflex.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Natural fucking 20.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** You're great.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Both of you still have to take half damage, though, whatever the hell that is.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** What about the monster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** That is nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Oh, good.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** All right.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Well, at least there's that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Okay.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** So full damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** How much?

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** How much?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** This is important.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** Total.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Jeez.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Hold on.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** I picked the wrong dice.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** All right.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:14]** So it's a 1d6 plus two.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** If you do it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** He rolled a seven.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** It's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Seven.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Seven.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** You rolled a six?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** Or no, you rolled a five.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** A five?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** No, no.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:32]** Yeah, I rolled a five plus two, so it's seven, which means the two of you take three damage.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** And it takes seven?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** That thing takes seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** It had seven HP left.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:55]** I totally imagine that as Dr. K stabbed it, and then as that electricity crackled, it was screaming from Dr. K's attack, and then the electricity just courses through it, and it falls out in chunks and dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** And so does Nico, though.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** And so does Nico.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Some sacrifices you have to make.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** Oh, man.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** God, Nico's just barely holding on.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** You guys are out of combat.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** You are out of initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** I had such a great line for the troll to say, too.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** What do you... What was the line?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** I had a plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** I was going to be like, Struggle as you went.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** Soon become a part of me.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** You can do a dying breath thing.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** What does it say?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:34]** It says, forgive Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** I got it.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** I got it.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** It's going to be philosophical nature.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:44]** Alas, I become nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** That was cute.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:52]** This is another Step Brothers reference?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Step Brothers 2008.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Step Brothers 2008.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Actually, that was my favorite line from that movie.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** That's original.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** Actually, no, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** That was good.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** That's an original line by Nico Quickfire Ryan.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** From Step Brothers.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** From Step Brothers.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** So what happens to the Electrovor?

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:09]** Eat shit, Derek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:15]** Well, I mean, the Electrovor, I guess being as I control it, it goes up to like

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:43]** Rick and he like climbs on his knee and then he like runs up to his face and he gives him like a little lick because he's apologizing you get a little static shock no and then he does the same short circuits your main CPU you die instantly does the same to doctor okay and then he runs back into here's his lab and here just gives him a little pet and here sheepishly puts his like one of his hands behind his head and is like ah sorry guys sorry


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:54]** question how long did that take because this thing's only allowed to be alive for one minute a day i don't think so i think it yeah there's a there's a it wasn't 10 rounds

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:59]** No, it was here for two rounds, and then it just spent 30 seconds or whatever.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** It's a fast little thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** It's back here.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** I put him back in his Pokeball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** His Poke figurine.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]** I think you only had it out for one round from the Pokemon battle.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** And then here, this is what, two?

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** You threw that second round?

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Yeah, so three.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** So that's fine.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** The Pokemon battle was the day before, wasn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** 10 rounds total?

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** I thought this was going to be your new sidekick forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** You did rest.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** That's right.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** He can recharge and come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** So what are you guys thinking?

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]** You're now in this room with these flickering lights.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:36]** There's this weird iridescent green and kind of red goo that's all on the floors.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]** And then in these broken tubes are this other type of goo.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:44]** And like I said, you did notice that there was something near one of the tubes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:52]** I'm going to look for that certain something and examine these tubes, perhaps, with, I don't know, life science.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Okay.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** The certain something was that object.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** Or I could do engineering to understand what this room is.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Obviously, we know what it is.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:03]** They're creating blob experiments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Yeah.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Do any of you recall?

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:15]** Rick wants to look at each of the because it looks like this creature came from one of these larger tubes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:19]** It doesn't seem like it came from one of the larger tubes.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** It seems like it's more consistent.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:27]** The sourdough, it looks like the green starter is on the floor here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:31]** I got a 29 on my life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:35]** On your life science for the blobs that are in the large test tubes.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Okay.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** Do any of you recall, you can probably just look in the notes, what the intent of this room was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Yeah, it's a weapons...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:51]** They were trying to experiment on creating some sort of demonic-like troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:52]** Yeah.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** I thought this was the room for that.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** Or it was the room for creating some kind of creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:03]** One of the rooms around here, they're doing biological testing, some element of magic, trying to summon creatures by combining magic and quantum mechanics.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** And when they're successful at summoning and manipulating them.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Emphasis on trolls and demonic creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** What was the other room?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** There were two other rooms, right?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** There were two other things that you found out.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:17]** Uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Okay.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** So yeah, there's a room for, Oh yeah.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:24]** There was the, the life experiments and the, yeah, I forget the other two, to be honest.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** What was it, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]** Because I wasn't paying attention at that time because Rick was busy lifting rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** Infrasound?

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Kicking rocks.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Infrasound was one.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Weapons was another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]** And then the, yeah, so weapons, infrasound, and the biological testing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:49]** Testing of weapons that shapeshifts words like astrozoan and cell pickup.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** Yeah.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** Weapon of polymorph, different states based on the user's will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:54 - 01:03:01]** So, Dr. O'Kay, as you're looking through, at first you're like, this is that room where they're pulling some sort of demonic thing.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:07]** But as you start really looking into the test tubes and everything, you're like, I don't think so.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** This is not that room.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:20]** In fact, when you go over, you do find this little, like, this data tag thing.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:28]** And it's sitting right, and it's connected to like a very loose bag that's not, you know, like the bag is just a bag.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:37]** And when you reach into the bag, you find a vapor cavitation pistol.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Here's the thing.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:50]** As you pull it out, and then you look at the data tag, you see the words, Living Transmutation Matrix.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** And on the data tag, as you flip it over, there's a small little computer chip.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]** And so in one hand, you're holding this data tag that says living transmutation matrix.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** And there's like a computer chip on it.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** They're like a little thumb drive.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** And then in the other hand, you're holding this vapor cavitation pistol.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:11]** And that was in the bag that had this name on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** So this is the weapons experimentations room or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** Yeah.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:17]** The more you think about it, you're like, there has to be something here where

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:29]** The goo that is iridescent, can't tell how that's related, but the blob stuff seems like there were some... These seem like they are not astrozoans.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** They seem like they're humanoids.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:34]** And you're like, okay, well, but some of the...

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:57]** cells and some of the vials in there do have like what you would know to be astrozoan cells so it seems like there's some sort of like reproduction transmutation cloning kind of like a like an aspect to this and it probably has to do with this weapon right because that's that's what you found um it's a weapon that like transmogrifies people into other things transmutes them

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** No.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:02]** So that might be found, though, if you plug in that computer chip.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Here's the other thing, doctor.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** OK.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:08]** When you're looking at the at the tubes, you're like, OK, well.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** One of them.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:17]** seems to be above each of them is like some robotic arm.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** Right.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:27]** And then, but here it's now mangled above each of the broken tubes and the fleshy lumps in the tube look very, very weird.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:35]** But as you look into one of them, you're like, I think that's a face.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]** And it looks like, and you can't recognize it.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** You're like, is that someone I know?

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:45]** That might be a celebrity.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Who is that?

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:51]** So I don't know if you want to tell people, but you could probably do a culture or maybe wisdom check to try and see who that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** Let's do culture check.

**[01:05:55 - 01:06:01]** I got a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** Yeah, crushed it.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** Seems like

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** It looks like Crush Casbah.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:18]** This is your DJ speaking.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** Last thing you knew, Crush Casbah.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** Kind of weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Crush.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** Wait, is that what we're really going with?

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Crush Casbah.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Crush Casbah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:30]** That's only one tube, right?

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:34]** I was wondering how you're going to introduce Crushed Cast Ball into this.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:37]** We talked about this before we even started the podcast.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:43]** We were like, we should have a radio station, and the host should be Crushed Cast Ball.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:48]** And I was like, I don't see how the story he was going to do that.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** And he just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** So that's one test tube looks like Crushed Casbah.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Are there other test tubes?

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Can we look at the faces on all the other test tubes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:57]** Those don't really have a face.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:01]** And again, it's kind of like you look at it and it's like looking at a constellation.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:04]** You're like, I think I see Orion, how that works.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]** You're like, I think that looks like Crushed Casbah.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:10]** But that also doesn't make sense.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** Like Crushed Casbah is, you know, like doing things in the studio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** Where's his talk show?

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** What's he doing here in this goop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** I do not listen to conservative radio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** I wouldn't call him conservative, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Oh, my God.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** I don't know who this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Crush Casbah.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:28]** I don't know.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** Crush Casbah.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Let's put it this way.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** LaShunta.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** He's a force to himself.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** LaShunta.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Kind of a shock broadcaster.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Let's call it that.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** It's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** but not like Alex Jones.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:43]** Oh, okay.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** Yeah.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:45]** Okay.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** Have you heard about what's going on on Versys?

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** I know exactly.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:58]** These, these like starter dough things you were talking about, um, that look at active or is that what crush Casbah is?

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:58]** One of the starter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:03]** No, the starter dough looks like it's the same consistency as that troll polyp.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:06]** And who did a perception check in here?

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** I rolled an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:09]** Okay.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** I'll do a perception check.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:10]** Yeah.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:12]** Nico, here's to you.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** Man, crushing it.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** Nico's actually doing a short rest right now.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:20]** Oh, you guys want to take... No, I'm taking a short rest by myself.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:20]** Oh, okay.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:25]** Because I'm just slumped over against the wall watching everybody else do things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** To get your stamina?

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Yeah.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Okay.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** Yeah, to get some stamina back.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** Okay.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:30]** I got a 14 perception.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** You got a 14 perception.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** Okay.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:33]** If you look...

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:44]** notices it, and you were just about to find it probably here, but on that south wall in the room, it's not glowing for some reason, but the...

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:53]** The goo, there's a thin line of it that runs up the wall, and it ends in a pipe that's only maybe like an inch in diameter.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** And the nozzle is just off.

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:57]** It's like the pipe is open.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** You two give me a survival check.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:04]** And Rick, too, because you were also doing a perception that you probably saw them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** It's got to be the astro zones that were on board.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:07]** Five.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:08]** Shit.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:13]** 11 plus 6 is a 17.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:15]** 17.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** You guys are like, it's got to be astrozoans.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** You got to be this.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:24]** And Rick comes up and says, whatever it is went into the pipe.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** It didn't come out of the pipe.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** It left this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:35]** Okay.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:39]** From my understanding, the astrozoans cannot compress themselves that low.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:44]** As we discussed on the ship, that the astrozoans could only compress themselves to the size of a ventilation pipe.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** This is much smaller than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** It's very astute.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** It's very astute, Rick.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** What do you guys say, too?

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** Because Nico's over in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:57]** Rick's going to pull out an incendiary grenade, pull the pin, and shove it into the pipe.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** Wait, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** Seriously, I think that was a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:08]** And that's how they came up with the end of I Am Legend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** Step Brothers 2008.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** Step Brothers 2008.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Yeah, the ending is so crazy for Step Brothers 2008.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** Yeah, it's crazy.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** There's a fire in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:23]** We should get Will Ferrell to be a guest player on this.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:23]** Yeah, we'll get him.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** So what are you guys saying?

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:24]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** What are you thinking?

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** But we'll have to call him Nighthawk.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** I don't mean to keep talking.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:33]** I'm just trying to get you guys to... Should we destroy this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:38]** No, here's before that... Well, yeah, go finish your thought, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** That was my whole thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Here's doesn't want to destroy it.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:45]** He wants to just investigate it a bit further and make sure that we totally get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]** How does here say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:51]** Did here's notice whoever picked up the object?

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:52]** Did he see that happen?

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:57]** Hey, look at this thing that I just found.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:00]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:02]** What's it called again?

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:07]** Well, you know the weapon is a vapor cavitation pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:10]** This is a vapor cavitation pistol, obviously.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** Yeah.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** I have to look it up, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:17]** It kind of looks like this is where the weapons were made from the computer, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** And he says that to Nico and everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** When he...

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:25]** Am I allowed during my short rest to do any type of skill check?

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:26]** Not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]** No.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** But, Dr.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:35]** O.K., as you were holding it up and doing that whole thing, and you were like, guys, look.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:45]** In your hand, it morphs into what looks like a survival knife and then morphs back into a cavitation pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** That's so cool.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** That's trippy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]** Wow.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:51]** It's all here, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** Wait, how does that do that if you're holding the handle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** It's, like, somewhat alive or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:59]** The handle, like, becomes the handle of the knife and then becomes back to the handle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:03]** It's like, oh, man, this is very interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:05]** Yeah.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:14]** In terms of, I mean, like, from the computer and from everything that you've seen, this is just technology that you are like, this is way beyond what I thought.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:20]** You were like, I don't even know where they would do stuff like this in the pack worlds.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** This is crazy advanced stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:25]** Totally astral, bro.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:25]** Bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]** Is there any more data that heroes could get from this room?

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:31]** Like other drives or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:35]** No, the only drive that you have is the one that's on the data tag for the living transmutation matrix.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** So there's nothing really else of value here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:39]** Nope.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:39]** What do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:48]** That's something else you should whisper as you're getting ready to leave somebody.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:50]** Burn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:53]** Burn it.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:59]** This, uh... Matrix doodad tag.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** Can we do, like, computers check on it, or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:07]** You can put it into a comm unit, maybe a computer, maybe a hacking kit.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:12]** You need to put it into a device so you can see what it says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:15]** Should we read what's on this thing or save it for later?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** Because we don't know what's going to happen later.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** So we've got to go back to the computer, I'm guessing.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** There might not be one later.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:22]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** You said there was an alternative, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** Or you can put it into your comment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:33]** Whatever you guys are doing, it's taking up the course of 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** I'm going to put this in my cup.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:37]** I'll fiddle around with it.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** Do you want a computer's check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** No, because as soon as it comes up, there's a little thing.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:48]** It says taxes 2020.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]** You open it.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:50]** You see what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:51]** IRS on it.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:55]** IRS on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** For who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** So... Crush Casbah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:22]** The documents, as you go through it, and we can do this a little bit offline, but the mechanics of this are that it's a level 5 technological item that can take the form of any basic or advanced melee weapon or small arm of item levels 1 through 3 of light bulk or less.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:29]** It is programmed, meta in a way, it's programmed with everything that's in the armory or the core rulebook.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:31]** You can spend an hour...

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:41]** putting in a new schematic, but you need the weapon that you want to have it be able to clone into, you need that weapon there.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:54]** And you can take time to build it to make it even better, to be a higher level, because it can only do weapons that are two below its level.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** So it's level five, can only do max...

**[01:14:56 - 01:15:20]** uh weapons of level three you could take i think it's like four hours eight hours turn it into with all the right stuff you can make it a level six so it can do more weapons only has two readied forms this is an interesting doodad i shall like it very much yeah so we can get more into that later but right now it can take the form of a vapor cavitation pistol or a survival knife

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:44]** well that's dope yeah if and at at any point if you guys take an hour if there's another weapon that you want to put in you can do that too so it's a light weapon uh the bulk of well it's the bulk of whatever the weapon is so but it can only do yeah basic or advanced melee or small arm of light bulk or less

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:50]** So that's you going through your iPad, reading through those files.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** That's kind of what you pull from it.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:53]** Well, interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:54 - 01:16:00]** So you're saying it can basically clone another weapon that is of that category?

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:01]** Two weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:08]** A melee weapon and a... It can clone any of those categories.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** It can clone them, though.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:14]** Yeah, so you could have two melee forms, you could have two ranged forms, but you can only have two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** But you have to have that weapon first, except for the two that he named.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:17]** Yes.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:17]** Right.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** It's already a vapor cavitation pistol and a survival knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:26]** How do these people even think of things like this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:31]** So in that sense, my, I don't know, my tactical greataxe is awesome.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** Does that fall into that category?

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:42]** Just real quick, my axe is a two-handed basic melee at level three, and it's amazing.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:45]** So if you want to try to copy that, that might be.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** Can I even wield it?

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:50]** I don't know, because it's basic melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:56]** I was planning to use it on my next thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** All right, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:01]** So what do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:06]** Rick is going to turn back and say, so we're leaving this room and not destroying it?

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:08]** We probably shouldn't destroy it, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:10]** No, it's probably not a good idea.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:12]** You never know what weird stuff will happen.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** Let's get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:15]** Let's leave.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]** And so Rick just kind of shakes his head and steps outside.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:21]** And then he's going to move to the... There's no door down on this side, right?

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** There's a door on the opposite side of the hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:27]** Yeah, the one door to the north of the hallway leads back into the central place where you found the gray bodies.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:31]** There's the other door on the other side of the same wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:39]** Okay, so then Rick is going to step to that door and like ready to enter and just kind of look over and wait for the others to join him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** Nico's going to walk over next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** Really, Nico?

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:45]** Seriously?

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:48]** You have like two health and you're going to stand next to me as I open a door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** I have full stamina now.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:59]** Rick is going to switch out his weapons and pull out his tactical grade X.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:03]** Pull out a tactical greataxe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:05]** I didn't say I'd be going in through the door right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:09]** Yeah, but you're standing in the same location that you were in.

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:13]** So if there's something right on the other side of this door, it can hit you.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:14]** Just letting you know.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:17]** Duly noted.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:20]** Right where I'm standing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** Actually, I'll just stand up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** Okay, great.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** See?

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:27]** One step back.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:28]** That's all.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** I like it.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** Yeah, and Rick will say that too, Nico.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:33]** Like, are you sure you want to stand this close?

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:36]** As he, like, wrenches his hands around his axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:41]** Nico's going to pull out his pistol and sword again.

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:41]** Quickly.

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:46]** And he's going to take, I'm going to take a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:51]** You're like, I'm going to rethink that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:52]** All right.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:55]** So Rick's going to then, he's going to just look at everybody and nod.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:59]** If they all give the go ahead, then he's going to push the button for the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:10]** So as you come up, give me a perception check.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:10]** To the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:12]** Great.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:13]** There's a trap or something.


## Speaker_0

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:19]** 11.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:21]** 11.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:29]** That's just enough to notice one little thing, which is that maybe from some... Because as you're walking, you're still feeling the ground.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:31]** Occasionally dust will fall from the ceiling.

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:34]** Maybe a rock will fall or a pipe kind of creak, right?

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** This place is unstable.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:40]** And that maybe shifted the floor a little bit underneath the door.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:42]** And so you can see...

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:51]** this fast red and white alternating kind of like shimmer in, you know, like it's kind of like you can just see daylight underneath.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:55]** You can see this light pouring through maybe a few inches past the door at your foot.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:59]** As you look down, it seems like there's some action going on.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:02]** There's something causing red and white lights.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:04]** It's coming out underneath the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:09]** Is there heat on the, I mean, okay.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Is the door hot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:12]** What does Nico say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:18]** Nico's going to call out to Rick19.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:21]** Hey, Rick, put your hand on the door.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:23]** Is it hot to you?

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Rick will reach forward and feel the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** Nope.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Feels cool.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:30]** No, it feels cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:33]** Here's cast detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:35]** Here's cast detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:37]** Is this the other room?

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:41]** The last room was the one you referred to with the weapons.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:43]** Is this possibly the biological room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:46]** Or the sound weapon one.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:47]** Whatever that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:51]** Infrasound.

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:53]** Infrasound.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:54]** You don't detect anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:57]** Yeah, you don't detect anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:58]** There's a trap.

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:03]** The first thing in there says you can't detect magical traps this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:07]** How is it he can't detect anything?

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:09]** He's such a good guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** You go first.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:13]** Rick pushes the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:14]** Look at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** You push the button.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:21]** Door opens.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:24]** You're immediately greeted by

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:29]** by a bright flash of just

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:59]** red that spills into the hallway and all of you see it red and white and the red is moving casting shadows your shadows behind you are moving clearly there's a lot going on in there rick you're probably the first to notice that you look in you can see from the side there seem to be six glowing red holographic displays of strange symbols mathematical terms they're revolving some are slow some are revolving quickly and

**[01:21:59 - 01:22:01]** And that's being displayed on the edges of the room.

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:10]** But you notice that there's a projector in the ceiling and it's displaying this comb that is like of information that they're all spinning at different rates.

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:13]** The data churning, rearranging itself, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:19]** Are these images the same as the images we saw when we first came into this room?

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:20]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:23]** The projectors flicker.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:23]** They were.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:24]** They spin.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:26]** You can hear...

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:29]** They move along tracks to keep the displays in motion.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:33]** Whenever there's something that might be revolving, it will like slide and like cover the other one.

**[01:22:35 - 01:22:40]** You also notice in the, in the middle, there's a podium in the center of the room.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:43]** It's surrounded by this like shifting, shining surfaces.

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:49]** Think of like minority report where like screens will come up and it's like a big podium and

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:55]** It's covered in like there's a there's like a tactile analog console where there's buttons and touchpads.

**[01:22:55 - 01:23:02]** And there's the mechanical arm attached to the ceiling spins around displaying the information.

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:05]** And it kind of holds a sheet.

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:29]** of like transparent material that displays smaller copies you can see almost data like occasionally like being pulled from one of the cylinders onto the screen in the middle as if you know whatever was there was thinking through grabbing data pulling it displaying it and to the other corner of the room from where the door that you are there's a double airlock door

**[01:23:30 - 01:23:39]** However, the most important thing that you notice is that you hear the same sound that Kelly is right now of clicking.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:53]** As you see a small, slight figure standing in the middle of the podium, but you can't make out really any of their face or their features because it's hidden behind all the data.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:55]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:56]** No!

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:58]** What?

**[01:23:58 - 01:23:59]** Oh, shit.

**[01:24:00 - 01:24:02]** Is it a gray?

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:10]** Do we know it's a gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:10]** We can see that, right?

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:11]** I don't know what it is, Kip.

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:11]** Well, hello there.
