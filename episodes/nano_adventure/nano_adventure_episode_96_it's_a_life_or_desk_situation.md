## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:28]** Music Music


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** You've come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:23]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** We'll save.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:29]** 96, I'm your corporate GM, John Swan, and I have a non-corporate question for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** Is this not approved by HR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:34]** It's fine.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Maybe it's cool.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:35]** I'm not sure.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:40]** But the thing is that if you walked into work and you had knuck tats, what would your knuck tats say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** Is that a knuckle tat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** Yeah, but it's what the cool kids say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Besides we'll save?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Because it fits perfectly?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** I'm just saying.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Because it fits, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:57]** I think as we're looking at Gen Con plans, I'm going to just find the best tattoo shop and just get a wool sip on my necks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** I'm down.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Navy, I would never do it.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** It was more of a Boston's Way thing, but they would get hold fast.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** What does that mean?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** It's a line thing.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** It's like if you're heaving, then you'd hold fast.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** You quickly stop what you're doing and hold the position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Is that how your biceps got to be?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Yes.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** Is that the workout that you do as you hold the rope?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** That's actually not how you hold lines at all.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** That's just, I'm in a small space trying to hold the line.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Hold the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Yeah, solid, solid.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** What about anybody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** This is a tough one.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** I don't think I would ever get them because they're kind of dumb.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** So I had to think about what I would do though.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** Dumb.

**[00:02:40 - 00:03:04]** yeah uh let me look up some ideas online real quick let me look up some ideas online no it's like what would you tattoo on your face like i'd prefer to tattoo nothing but if i probably get digimon so i can just yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't think i i would ever put anything on my hands or face


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:08]** Yeah, well, it's an extreme option for the first tattoo, right?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I don't know that anyone starts with the knuckles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Well, I take that back.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** I actually do have a knuckle tattoo.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Is that a challenge?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** You do.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:15]** I used to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** You can do it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:22]** I had the Green Lantern symbol tattooed on my knuckle in blacklight ink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** So you couldn't see it unless it was under blacklight, but it faded out within a year.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** It was completely gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** I got a UV flashlight.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** We can see if it's still there, but if you already know, it's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I still check it every once in a while when I walk past a blacklight.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** I'm like, nope, it's gone.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** It hasn't been there in 10 years.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** It's not coming back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** I like the idea of a blacklight tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:49]** Yeah, then you can only look dumb in very select places.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** I had a whole plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** I had a whole plan for like sleeves and everything.

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:00]** Um, and one of them was, I was, my job in the Navy was nuclear power.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:10]** So my, I have, uh, uh, my whole navel tattoos on my, my left shoulder and there's this rising sun for, you know, cause I was West, West pack sailor and jet Japan and the rising sun.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** But I was going to do a beam of, from that sun going up my neck.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:19]** and doing the radiation symbol right here, like real big on my neck.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:23]** But it was going to be in blacklight, so the only time you would see it is under blacklight.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** How often do you go under blacklight?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** I used to go to clubs all the time, so pretty often.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** How often are you under blacklight now?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Not often at all.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Not often.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** You should have it only glow when there's, like, radiation around or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** That would be, like, kind of cool.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:46]** It would actually be great, like, you one day take your son to, like, laser tag or, like, some place where you're just, like...

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** It's black light bathed in it.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** And people are like, what's wrong with you, Kevin?

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Is that a radiation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Face tap.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Are you sure we're going to do that power?

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** This is what happens.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** This is actually what happens to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** You have like full tribal face tats that only show up.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** That would be like amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** On your forehead, it just is like, fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:30]** you know you didn't tell anybody you didn't tell your family you didn't tell us you didn't tell anybody you just got it all the kids are like like run away yeah that'd be great i don't know i i guess you should do dr pepper or something i saw someone like i was looking up tats and someone says diet coke diet coke is like for someone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:38]** I've seen Karen, Bean, and Rice for foodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** Bean and rice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** I feel like I knew that after having your mom's cooking all the time.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Or maybe like read book.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** Wait, what?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Reading a book for somebody who wants to read a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Yeah, that's probably what I would get.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** It was read more because I don't read nearly enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** Yeah.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** That's true.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** Or you don't read fast enough more accurately.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** There's this one that I saw.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:08]** There's one that says tea time and then one of their index fingers is a f***ing pot of tea.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:25]** it's like it should be the pinky yes you're right it should be that would be way better wow these are so i don't even know how to describe them we could we could do like john's dogs but with like the mustache on the on the upper knuckle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** It's just amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** I knew way too many people that had the mustache tattoos on their fingers.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** That was the thing in the mid-2000s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** The hipsters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:47]** Should I get one and then surprise people with an actual mustache?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:51]** What was the thing with like, that was like the man bun of like tattoos, right?

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Where it was cool for like a year, right?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Like, but it was supposedly cool, right?

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** The mustache thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:01]** I feel like the man bun is a little, has a little more longevity than just a year.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Like it's still.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** You would tattoo a man bun on your hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:30]** and then you're just like yes it would almost be better than it's just like the mustache but it's on it's certainly better than a real some people some people can pull it off like i think will could pull off a man will but there are some people that can't don't you have one don't you have to have one no he does oh my god this whole time you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** It's not.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** It's just his hand.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** It's just his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:40]** I did organically say that Will's would be fine.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** So there you go.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** It's all right.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** It worked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:47]** I've never seen your man bun in both your hands in the same room at the same time.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** So there's no way to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:49 - 00:08:17]** his is fine because it's practical but there are some people that are like i'm just gonna tighten it up so much that i look like you know what i mean where they look like some some leggy bitch you know where they have like really really tight where it doesn't make sense a leggy bitch yeah it's a whole thing sorry i'm tired today i don't know i was learning words from kelly yeah just like those like very uh uppity uppity sorts that are in the kind of what do you mean yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Yeah.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** They have legs.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** Let's grill Kelly Moore on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** I've been watching K-dramas.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** What is uppity to you?

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** The main girl has to go against.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** Oh, that's an archetype.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** Rich, spoiled girls.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Snobbish.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Entitled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Aggressive.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Correct.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** Leggy.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Quarrelsome.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Menacing.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:46]** Kelly, could it be that they're just actually normal?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** And if a man were doing that, then they wouldn't be called a leggy b***h, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** If you have legs and you're a man that does it, if you have nice legs, then you'd be a leggy b***h for sure.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** But most men don't show off their legs.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** So, I have long legs.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Maybe I'll be a leggy b***h someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:05]** You can show off your legs in one of our new Just In Time For Spring swimsuits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I have the real safe swimsuit.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** It's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:15]** Sir, whoever donned a swim trunk, a swim garb.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** I don't think I've ever seen Kelly's legs.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** They don't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** This is going to sound weird, but we were in the spa that one time, right?

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Looking at the stars together.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** That's not weird.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Oh, yeah, we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** At Will's house.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** I actually do remember.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I vividly remember being like, oh, your legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** I had actual legs.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** No one had to lift me and drop me into the spa or anything.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** I actually had to walk my own way there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** They weren't tattooed on the back of your hands?

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:56]** If any of you do any disguises or deception that involves a body part, it needs to be you using your hand to imitate it.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Just hands down.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** Mostly mustache.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:01]** Alright, speaking of Starfinder, I think we should get back in.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** Nobody's talking about Starfinder.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** Nobody.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** Anyway, good talk.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Well done.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** I think we should play some Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Wait, what is Starfinder?

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** Can you explain it to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** It's where you take your hand and I'll just stop there.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** You point at the stars?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** And you point at the stars.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Found them!

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Hey!

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I found the stars.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** Don't ever do that.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Watch one shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Or I will lose it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:34]** Before we start, there are two things that I want to chat about, actually.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** I just recalled.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** I don't want to do this.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:45]** The first is that we have, as part of our coffee rewards...

**[00:10:45 - 00:11:12]** ways to interact with us is to write in a sentence that one of us will read and incorporate into into the episode and we have some today so how this is going to work is that i'm going to roll a die to see who gets the sentence then i will just randomly choose a sentence i'll message you privately and then it is your job to incorporate it into the episode

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** We can go from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:18]** Do we secretly incorporate it and then later say that that was the incorporated sentence?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** It might be very clear at the same time.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** Oh, God.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** It's unclear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** I think we should set ground rules.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:32]** If you can sneak it into a very serious moment, then don't stop in the middle and go, that was a sentence.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** That's the one.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** You did that to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Fair enough.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** As other players, if we think that's a sentence, we're all just going to point.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** That's me pointing at the screen.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Our listeners can't hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** Will we know who has the sentence?

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** Or is that also going to be a mystery?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** That's a good question.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** I've already rolled, so I now know who has it and what sentence they're going to get.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** What do y'all think?

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** I kind of...

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:24]** you know what it stays a mystery it stays a mystery i'm gonna message that person yeah i'm gonna watch real closely to see who gets the message i'm gonna message that person on you have to make sure that that person's actually going to notice too what are you messaging on i'm gonna message on discord privately

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** So you all keep an eye out.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:45]** The other thing that I wanted to bring up is that one of the other things that has kind of organically come up from our coffee is this unreasonable request for Venny as per his New Year's resolution.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:49]** So, Benny, is that the one that you're going with?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:56]** You want to share what it is that is this week's Unreasonable Flavor of the Week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** Have fun this entire episode, Benny.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** It's going to be fun for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:16]** O-A-E-B-A-A-O-N-G-L-A-A-D-A-O-R-F-A-E-B-A.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Solid.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Okay.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Keep trying.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** Whoever did this to Vinny, you're mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** I think it's good old Glenn Bob.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:27]** And I feel really bad because Glenn Bob, he can't see these because he's not in the channel.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:33]** But we'll gladly read off all the unreasonable requests to you.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:38]** Or you can just join our coffee and then get access to that channel.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:41]** And I'll give you a little workaround.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:47]** You could also find out who does have access to that channel and then forward them through those people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** You could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:50 - 00:14:05]** I'm going to just say... It's one more hour of this, folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:32]** adam did say it was only your character voice so i think you've been working too hard you know what i'm saying yeah yeah you know all right i'm done all right good wasn't the whole point of it so the whole point of that channel was so that people could send things to you and you said no to them because that was your resolution right you need to stand up for yourself and say no to me i've said no to all of them except this one and maybe the margarita mixer we'll see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Yeah, we'll see about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** I'm a sucker for single-use kitchen items.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:50]** My request is if you do the margarita one, I fully support it as long as it's in full sight behind you and you stand up, turn around, and go... When you're talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** When you're talking.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** I was thinking I would have it on my desk and then I could pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** And right into the mic.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Yes, please.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Please.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** All right, let's play.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Enough shenanigans, y'all.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Enough shenanigans.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** Shenanigans show.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:21]** Time to kick some ass because you finally entered the new office of Ringworks Morrow through the executive balcony, the back door.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:32]** Kara is starting to test out her probably well-trod ability of electro location graph to determine the layout inside.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** And it was like, no, this is not a good place to use it.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Maybe you'll use it as a set.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:36]** We'll see.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** We'll see.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** Cecil smartly drops secret slime to look for any traps.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Smart practical use of y'all's abilities.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** Inside, you discover the scene of the kidnapping.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:56]** You see Leora's oration practice device had been talking and talking and talking.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:02]** And as you search the newly furnished office...

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:28]** you actually can i share the relics that she had on the on on the back of her desk because i i just thought that they were cool y'all were like professionals and we're like no we're gonna keep going but can i can i share what they were yes sweet yeah okay and tell us the values that we missed because we're not pirates in this adventure yeah they're yeah they're all they start at at uh it's all seized as evidence classic

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:32]** The first one was... Guys, it's called Civil Seizure.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Yeah, Civil Asset Forfeiture.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:40]** Well, I guess if you don't save her, you know... Well, then we have to take it.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:45]** One of the artifacts is one of the last...

**[00:16:45 - 00:17:05]** faster on resource trade papers like i'm picturing like like a stock market like trade of a faster on company and i i also imagine that it's printed on like the old school computer paper that had the little holes on the side that you tear off stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah you know yeah

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:30]** uh another one is an early contemplative intellect enhancer that doesn't work anymore but it resembles glasses because it increases the amount of information that you can take in at one time these are all like some whether this is all goggles from unsaid company yeah yeah they look exactly like an early contemplative intellect enhancer yeah and the last one is a uh

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:58]** is a bit of tech that looks newer not powered though you can probably picture it it's a it's a a joint venture between two companies one of them vitari tech and another gamut bio it's schematics for a sublingual implant that uh that controls your tongue it it allows you to speak almost any language but it was very quickly discontinued after some research trials and uh some focus groups

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:04]** Because it was worried that it could be like there was a potential breach for security.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** So the worry was that you could control what people were saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** It actually just gave you Tourette's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** It actually.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Yeah.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Yeah.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:17]** So those were the three artifacts that I had that I wanted to share.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** Anyway, so you all were professionals, and you're like, you know what?

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Not even going to take a look at that.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:27]** So instead, Kara, Cecil, you determine that there's a building alarm that was tripped.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:33]** You discover, I believe, boom, that there was nothing on the computer.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** But there were signs that...

**[00:18:36 - 00:19:02]** some that that there's traffic activity going through the southern door boom you open that door into an ambush cecil just gets hit and then you all drop into the efficiency that we've seen from the stars team uh with miko and kara slicing the pie in the room each of you attacking a different assailant and then boom saying the namesake of the of

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:21]** episode 95 it is time for boom throwing in an explosion or a grenade that causes a large explosion that only unfortunately dealt one damage but did destroy the hard work of many fellow morrowans who made the conference table

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** That was a lot of hours, a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, and you blew it up in one go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** It was a really nice office that we assaulted, to be fair.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** It was a very nice job.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** She has good taste, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Yeah, there was that armor there.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** And with that, you know what?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Let's go right back because that battle's not over.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:43]** I'm going to bring you guys over to the new office.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** We're jumping right back into combat.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** And let's see.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** Whose turn did we end on?

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** We ended on Boom's turn.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Throwing in the grenade.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** Blowing that all up.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Where is my... Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Tell me.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** It says loading new office again.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:05]** And I never asked this before, but what's the old office?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** So, it was Boom's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I think you threw the grenade.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** Was there anything else that you wanted to do on your turn there, Boom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Yeah.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** I'm not sure I can do anything after throwing a grenade because I can't remember.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** I guess I just move, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Well, it should be a standard action.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** Yeah, throwing that was a standard action, so you could move if you want.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** You want to move into the room?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** Pass.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Nah.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Nah.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Nah.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** Nah.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** I'm good.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** I'm good.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** Boom's good at the moment.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** He just shrugs.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** He's like, we're still good, Boom.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** That's it.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** To himself?

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** He says that out loud, but it was to himself.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** It was only one damage, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** You hear it right in your ear.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** Cecil gets Boom standing right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** A boom is still a boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:13]** a boom is a boom and also i guess he'll like roll like a life science to figure is there anything he could do to like figure out any weaknesses i guess like uh you could but they seem like they're vesk agents iff agents uh okay you could try but i'm just gonna tell you that that there's not anything special that you're gonna get from them unless you're gonna try and like yeah there's nothing special what

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** There's nothing special that you can get from them.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Boom just gets ready to make more boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Classic.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** As one does.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:36]** The southern vest across the way that Kara shot at and damaged is going to begin to... Let's see if I can do this.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:39]** I'm going to use my measuring tool.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:44]** They are going to run up to you...

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:56]** Kara dropping their gun and, uh, let's see, pulling out their gun clatters to the floor as they pull out their tactical dueling sword.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:04]** And as they're running over, pushing past the chairs, their voice just screams and fills this tiny little conference room.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:13]** Just saying the stars will lose a life and they are going to roll to hit you with the sword.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Uh,

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** That is a 20 against KAC.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** That hits.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:28]** K, they reach out, stab into your shoulder for seven points of piercing damage.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Bring the pain home to you.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Bring the pain home.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** That's their turn.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:40]** The other IFF Vesk is stunned.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Can't do anything.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:50]** By the way, drops their weapon, because if you didn't know, stunned, you drop everything you're holding, you can't take any actions, and you're flat-footed.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** So, yeah, they're f***ed.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** They should have that f*** tattoo on their forehead.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:03]** Are you going to take revenge on the vest that kills you and turn to the dark side once for all?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Who killed me?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Shot at you.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** The one who dealt the damage.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** The one that was sitting shot me, right?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** No, it was the one from across the way.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** The one who just stabbed Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** That was like a whole week ago.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:25]** No, Cecil is going to... He's actually going to step forward and he's going to climb up and jump into the chair at the top of the screen.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:34]** And he's going to jump on the chair, but now he is in reach of both Vesks with his tactical pike.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:39]** And so he's going to swing at the one next to Kara.

**[00:23:39 - 00:24:03]** did you like get up there with your pike do you like stamp it on the ground yes that's exactly what he did you want an acrobats for that rush i mean if you actually want to do that yes yes i do want that aha 19 on the die we spent for this acrobats okay after that helicopter dismount i wasn't sure where this was going

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** myself.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You do.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** So yeah, he doesn't even take a step.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:13]** He just kind of slams on the ground, pole vaults, you know, a whole 10 feet onto this chair.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:18]** And then he's going to swing at the one next to Cara.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:23]** That's a 12 on the die for a total of 16 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** 16 to hit.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Casey?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Yes.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** 16 KAC.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Tie goes to the attacker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** It hits.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Nice.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Sweet.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Okay.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** And so this is a non-lethal attack, just to note that.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** And...

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:49]** That is a one on the die for a total of eight points of non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Non-lethal.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Non-lethal damage.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:57]** Do you hit them with the butt end instead of the sharp end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** The flat of the blade?

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:06]** He's kind of got the... Yeah, he either turns the blade backwards, and I think the tip of the pike is actually just a rubber ball.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:16]** So right as the guard stabs you, Kara, and shouts in your face, baring their teeth angrily...

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:22]** They get knocked out and they fall unconscious onto the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Notably not killed.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Not killed.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Hasten to add.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** Hasten to add.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Very good, Cecil.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** That was the end of the first round.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Migo, what are you doing?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** It's your turn.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Top round two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:38 - 00:26:02]** um migo is going to step up to his uh stunned vesk as he takes the one step over you see the energy start to pulse in his hand as it turns into the hammer we now recognize from the museum yeah yeah yeah yeah surprise mother lethal as fuck right oh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Solid.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Good, good, good.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** Did you roll a natural one?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** I can't tell if it's a 20 or a one.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** I think it's a one.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** It's a one.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** That's a critical failure.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:17]** I think... Carly Migo is the motherfucker that's being surprised today.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** It is a new hammer.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Give him that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I'm still working out the kinks.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** It's fine.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** You know, this kind of reminds me of a funny story.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** You remember that time?

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Oh, wait.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** What was I talking about?

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** What?

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** You know the hammer?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Did you break some pressure?

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** No, no, I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** What?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Benny, tell me when to stop.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** 3, 2, 1.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Stop.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Very quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:57]** He actually says, I'm proud to say I love my cafe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** The natural one broke you.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Is it energy or kinetic?

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:24]** uh oh that's a good question it does both please both of these work uh one is better than the other but yeah oh let's go energy because it does more energy damage all right uh you start talking in pig latin because you are confused for 1d3 rounds


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:48]** that is that is what happens amazing that is i how does that okay okay let's let's play that out so yeah he's so like jazzed to just hammer this thing home that he overpowers the hammer and like doesn't have quite enough energy in his cognition centers to like be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Yeah, it's like a flash.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Rebooting.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Hang on.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** You're frozen.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** It's better than the kinetic, which was stop hitting yourself, and you take weapon damage and apply any critical hit effect.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** So be thankful you didn't choose that.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Yeah.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** Okay, so you're confused for 1d3 routes.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:07]** Love that.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Love that.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** My God.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** All righty.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** Kara, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** Oh, I rolled 1d3?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:18]** I just assumed you did.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Yeah.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Go ahead and roll.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** It's your condition, after all.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** One round.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** One round of being confused.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Kara, what are you doing?

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:31]** Miko just got confused next to you, but the vest in front of you dropped like a sack of Mara potatoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:40]** Well, I see Miko struggle, and I continue to step over the body of this vest, I guess.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:47]** I shake off the wound, and I raise the light asphalt pistol, or rifle,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:47 - 00:29:12]** uh to fire at the the vest the stunned vest do it do it is before you make that action is the stunned vest still stuck yeah they were stunned for one round and you stunned them on round one so i believe they would be stunned for round two okay then around three okay you have a dirty 20 you got a dirty 20 dude that hits man they have a pretty low eac ksc right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** That is then seven points of bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Seven points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:26]** I feel like part of a slow smile kind of crept out the vest face seeing you freeze, Migo.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:32]** And then they just get hit with Kara's gun and they die.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:40]** The smile still on their face slumped in the chair.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** You all wait for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** I don't hear anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** No, but like, that's what I was saying.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:50]** This reminds me of that other time when he got the hammer.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** He always ends up finding the hammer.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** You know what I mean?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Who are you talking about, Cecil?

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Migo!

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Migo, you okay?

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Ah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** You've got mail.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** That didn't happen last time.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** We lost Cecil and we lost Miko.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Bless you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** Excellent job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Good job, boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** Cecil climbs up on top of the table as he's saying all that.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** It's totally destroyed.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Completely destroyed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** I mean, you can step on the debris, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** All right.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** And then I'm assuming Archie comes in the room.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** Archie does come into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:29]** I guess just on top of the conference table, or is it just totally destroyed?

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Totally destroyed.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Totally destroyed.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Splinters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** I see there is a computer here.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:40]** Let me run a check on it and see what we can find.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:45]** It's a middling 12, even though I have a pretty big bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** You do have, yeah, you got that big bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** Sisa and Kara are going to move down to the door to the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** Kara's going to just look at the body of this unconscious still.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Unconscious, yeah.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Do we want to bind him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Yes.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:25]** yeah maybe take his honor something like that which cecil's not gonna say this out loud but that's what we should be doing to all of these guys is taking them non-lethally and arresting them instead of killing them on site i'm saying we're cops they're literally kidnappers no that's kevin say that through for cecil cecil would never admit this so what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** Let me see if I have some rope on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** I do.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** I have binders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, we should all have binders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:36]** So I'm going to make this vest, throw them in binders.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Search the pockets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:48]** Yeah, Migo checks the dead body for keys or data pads or information or, you know, currency or whatever.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Good question.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** John, is there really nothing on the computer?

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Like, nothing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Not with a 12.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** You can't see if there's anything even on there to begin with, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Anyone know anything about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:04]** You see mostly the conference room control system that, of course, is buggy and doesn't work.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** They value engineer that out.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** So...

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:16]** In the pockets of the VESC IFF agents, you don't find anything like... Let's see.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** You find their weapons.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** They both had tactical railguns and tactical dueling swords.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** They both have freebooter armor and longarm rounds.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:30]** In one of them, there is...

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** One doesn't have a data pad.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** The other one does have a data pad.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:45]** And open in it, the one that is dead, it seems to be a whole log of feeding and caring for creatures called needle hawks.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:55]** And you think about it and you're like, wait, maybe those were the creatures that attacked us when you first landed.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:58]** And this was its caretaker.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** This was their caretaker.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:20]** hey you guys you guys ever heard of needle hawks no probably those things we felt outside yeah needles in me the you are so poisoned is there is there any additional information about needle hawks on this data pad there is let's see what would you get from it i mean you get all the the standard stuff that you would get about a needle hawk it's just like a pokedex about

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** No, it's more of their feeding schedule and more of their carrying schedule, right?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** How many are there?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** There were two.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Oh, just two?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Yeah.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** They were both named Miguel.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Okay.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Spelled different?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Yeah.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** They both, yep.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** They are tiny.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Tiny?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:48]** but they have that poison ability, um, that allows them to shoot this round of needle Hawk toxin.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** They're like kind of a winged arthropod.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** And, uh,

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** They're pretty interesting.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** I'll just let you guys read about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** Based on the feeding schedules, could you figure out how many he has?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Could they have more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** Yeah, from what I'm seeing here, the two we saw outside is it.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Let's keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:12]** There's a voice over your commune that chops in, and it's Commander Bolt through Archie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** Hey, so, look, I got a couple of things, information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** Right now, currently, the architect and the engineer for this building are refusing to give us plans.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** We're working on it.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:31]** We did learn that there are three primary doors out of the C-suite that you're in.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** That go into other parts of the building.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** We were able to contact a janitor.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:41]** They said that they saw some movement in the private home library a lot.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:50]** Also, Kinkara is the leader of the agents that attacked in the museum, causing all that chaos.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** ruckus, destroying all those fossils.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:09]** She said that she confirmed that Leora Huxley is the target of the attacks and that apparently they have this whole future thing down that you four will find her and you will find her at the gate.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** A little odd.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** Also, we got some information coming in from Lieutenant Lua here.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Let me pat you in

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:23]** If you recall, Lieutenant Lua, your friend, the Raxalite, who was transferred to a different office, but you saw at the Natural Museum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:27]** Hey, so I want to confirm something real quick with you.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:39]** Look, I've been doing some research because all of the good work that you did to save those kidnappers or those perpetrators in the past few months...

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** It just wasn't sitting right with me.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Something about it wasn't right.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:54]** So I'm reading through all their statements and none of them remember what happened in the five minutes before we got there.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** I don't know what that is.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** It's just weird.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** I'm going to keep diving and looking and I'll keep you updated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:29]** sounds earingly earingly whatever like threefold which i guess this technically is but the idea of like not remembering something for five minutes or time skipping is not fun such ptsd and immediately we were all paranoid again yeah exactly it was fun for a while and now it's back the paranoia thanks john who do you think made this adventure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:53]** before we go any further uh i did want to say that the the line that i said um about do you remember that time was the line from finder so thank you for submitting that finder sorry for confusing you kelly that makes sense got you kelly he got you man he got you that was good that was good fine good job finder thanks for confusing me today i appreciate it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:56]** This is how a villain origin story starts.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Kelly is now Finder's mortal enemy.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** Finder is the big bad of everything all along.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** He's been a plain sight all along.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** All right, so what do you guys do?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** You are in this conference room.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** You've searched through their pockets.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** You've determined that one of them was the caretaker for the Needle Hawks.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** You haven't found anything on the computer that is there.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** And Cecil is currently at the door.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Kara...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:23]** We learned that there's motion in the library?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:33]** It seems like the private library, if you recall, part of this new office building connects to the private residence for Leroy Huxley.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:48]** And it seems like of the three portals, or not portals, apertures, doorways, connections into different parts of the building, the one into the private library is where...

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** The janitor saw movement that was a little sus.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:54]** Unusual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** You said there were three entrances to a C-shaped something or other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** C-suite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** C-suite is where we are now?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Feels like it would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** I'm trying to figure out this room.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Okay.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Okay.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Well, there are the other doors in here.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** Is there a secret passage?

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Can we look for a secret passage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** He did give us a secret slime.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** I already used mine.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** You could roll a perception check.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** You could do a search.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** All right, let's do it.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** You want to do Perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** I'll roll Perception, but I'm at the southern door.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** Everyone knows about the southern door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** I'm going to do it from... This is like the main office, right?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Back here?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Yeah.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** I'll do it in here.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Oh, it's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:42 - 00:39:05]** it's probably behind the desk pull a statue down and opens up yeah crush it 24 24 you don't find anything you find you don't find anything here that is like suspect you you pull the swords out of their scabbards you you turn on you you put on the uh early contemplative vision


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:26]** intellect enhancer nothing happens you search under the desk spray you don't feel like light all over the room yeah you look for any black light tattoos there's no radiation just black light knuckle tattoos all over car you look into the computer and do a finger mustache and see if it unlocks something it doesn't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:50]** um we're looking for like three for a room with three doors going into it essentially right it's like the c-suite is that correct because that room does have three doors the the ceo uh yeah this room so we haven't gone out the the west door i did i went in there it was a hallway yeah and you haven't gone to lead to somewhere though right another door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** It led to the outside.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** That was like another enclosed deck area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** There were two... That was an interstitial hallway.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:04]** When you walked out, Cecil, you did see there was a door across from you that you thought, oh, that's probably one of the outside doors.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** And then there was a door to the south.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Oh, okay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** There was a door to the south in that hallway?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** In that hallway.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** And then there's a door to the south in the conference room that you're at now.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:18]** And Cecil is at that doorway and got a seven for perception.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** You walked up to where?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Oh, in the southern door of the conference room?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** The southern door of the conference room.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** Seems like it's a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** Boom rolled a 16 and is checking the conference room, too.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Just kind of going along the walls.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** See if there's anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** You don't see anything.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** You see the makings of a Keurig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Boom makes himself a quick cop.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Migo stacks up behind Cecil.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** He's like, all right, kid.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** I'm with you, Cecil.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Kara, what are you thinking?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Do we keep going?

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Yeah, let's push.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** All right.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Cecil, you want to throw this open?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** I'm ready.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:57]** Boom readies his machine gun and points it at the door, ready for action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** Click the door open.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:08]** You open the door into a grand lobby, easily 50, 60 feet down and across.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** You see a doorway at the other end that looks very official.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:18]** You can see on the other side that there's some writing for anybody coming in from the outside.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** There is a small receptionist desk near that door across from where you are.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** And then it seems like the hallway, the lobby curves out.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** off to the left and to the right.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** And no one's stepped outside yet, so you can't see what else there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:37]** There's no bodies in that visual area, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** You want to give me a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Do I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** 18.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** 18.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:47]** So, the light in this room is nice.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** It's warm.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:52]** The floor is golden warm color.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:59]** There's clearly a very central walkway emblazoned through the floor of white surrounded by gold.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** Beautiful warm sconces.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:05]** It's a nice... The finishes are nice in here.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You're looking over at the desk.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** This is kind of small.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Maybe it's just the first one they got.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** They're waiting on the nice one to come.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** The one made by the same people who made the conference table.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** And you're looking...

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** At that desk.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** And you see something at the very bottom of the desk.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** You feel like you see some movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** I got some movement in my head.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:31]** And he's going to, as he says that, he's going to pull out his pulse caster rifle.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** And by pull out, I think it's my array.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** I am ready.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** So yeah, the nanites just turn into a pulse caster rifle.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Sweet.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** That's cool.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** And what do you do?

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** And he's going to... I gotta move the map so I can actually grab my character.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:51]** He's gonna step in and sweep left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Okay.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:59]** You step in and you see off to your left on the map here, you see a doorway.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:06]** You see a doorway to your bottom left that seems to be headed somewhere.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** And then you see two doorways...

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:14]** One directly across from you and one on your bottom right.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:18]** And outside of that doorway, there's a small security panel on the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:21]** And I saw something move under the desk down to the south.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Correct.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Correct.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** And so, yeah, he'll step in and kind of sweep to the left.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:31]** But he's also going to point to the table and say, I got hostiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Are you sure they are hostiles?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Not yet.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Then why, why are you saying I got something?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** I know you don't know, but you need to specify.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** The term is bogeys.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Okay.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** I will flush them out.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Yeah.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:51]** And then, uh, boom, we'll target his machine gun into the room and they're under this desk.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:54]** This sort of like, uh, what are they called?

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Secretaries sort of desk kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** Um, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:23]** you're gonna wait wait so you asked me if it's hot if they're actually hostile and then you're just gonna i'm not gonna kill them i know that's where your mind always goes just take it easy and relax all right he points it there and he's like step out slowly hands up there's no response nothing step out slowly hands up or i will fire


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:45]** You see a hand come up, and then another Yosuke hand come up, and they scramble out, and it's a Yosuke wearing an IFF uniform.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** And they step out from behind the chair.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Their faces...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:14]** unreadable and they step out and step in front of the desk what do you do step forward slowly keep your hands up and no harm will come to you cut this way and you all are just waiting in there waiting in the conference room


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:41]** uh car's gonna come in uh boom's at the entrance to the conference room but he wants to cuff this individual yeah i was i was sort of waiting for boom to clear the doorway to to let the rest of us out boom small you can get around all right then uh then it was going to move forward a little bit right yeah boom you guys are stopping start starting to move into the space okay

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** I'm going to fan out just past Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Okay.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Come this way, my friend.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:54]** Are they wearing armor similar to the other assailants we've seen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** They step forward, their face unreadable.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** I need Boom and Migo to give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** Oh, that's a... 19.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:11]** 11.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Okay.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:39]** boom you are focused on this yusoki oh my god migo you think for a second that you hear something at the door to that yusoki's right the one with the security panel in front of it okay can i see from here whether that door is locked no is there a label on that door not that you can read from where you're at migo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:46]** So I'm going to whisper into the comms quickly.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Guys, it sounds like we might have bogeys.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** I'm going to try to lock that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:55]** Boom hears that, but he doesn't want this Yusuke to become a problem later.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** So he tries to hurry him along.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Come closer, come closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:06]** Miko crosses across to the security panel and looks for a lock mechanism for the door that is next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:29]** you would need to use the console which is uh you would just need to do a computer check okay like while that's happening uh cecil's going to step further to the it's the screens right but to his left but he's gonna he's just kind of tracing backwards and just to clear that um that space to the right but he's keeping an eye on the yusoki as well okay and cara what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:35]** Kara's going to step into the room past the, I believe it's the console that's behind her.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:55]** As she enters the room and she's going to come around, fanning out away from Cecil, exposing the other corner and inching towards the unknown assailant with her attack lash in hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Taclass ready.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Okay.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:02]** Cecil walks around the corner, sees another doorway up to the right, kind of wrapped around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Kind of a forgotten door.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** It's the one to the hallway, presumably, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** Yeah, the one to the left seems like that was the one to the hallway that Cecil saw earlier.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:18]** And then Cecil is currently walking to the right, the other, like the mirror image of you, Kara, and sees another door up that way.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:23]** And then there's a door to your, to like, maybe like 10, 15 feet away from you, Kara.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** That, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:32]** Two things happen as you all are silently trying to keep the situation calm.

**[00:48:34 - 00:49:01]** Migo, as soon as you step up to that console and you hit it, the door next to you opens and you can see the outline of another Yosuke and the words, the stars will lose a life, ring out throughout the chamber as you realize too late that

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:07]** Migo, that there was a trap on this console and you need to give me a reflex save.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** And I need everyone to roll for initiative.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** Who shouted the Stars of Luzerlight?

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Some other small Yosuke.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** Yeah, a second figure in that room.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** Let's go first with the reflex save from Migo.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Yikes.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Yikes indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** and 18 on your reflex save.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** Okay, it was DC 14, so you do pass.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** So you only take...

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:45]** 11 points of electricity damage as this arc just... Just 11.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Just 11 arcs out and hits you.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** Oh, wow.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Good stuff.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Glad that you fell for the trap.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Realized too late.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Too late!

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** Alright, I'm adding you guys to the carousel.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** We're in combat again.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:04]** What does everyone get for their initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Oh, we gotta roll again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I forgot.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** 24.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:32]** funky okay we got a 20 from boom car got a 13 car got a 13 okay 17 for 17 from cecil and i need to add migo into this here maybe yeah yeah yeah it says i'm in yeah i just add you okay sorry so 13 cecil right cara 17 yes 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** 17, Cecil.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** 13, Kara.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Also 13.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Tommy.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:37]** Migo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Who has a higher initiative?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** I got a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Ooh!

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** You're dropping.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** You're going down, Benny.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Migo.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** Top of round one.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** It's the Yosuke who was standing in the hall.

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** And they are going to pull out... Yeah, it's super convenient.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** They are going to... They had their static arc pistol in their hand hanging.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:12]** And they aim that at Cecil because Cecil always needs to get hit first in combat.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** It's just the rule of this nano venture.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** That is an 11 against EAC.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** That's a total miss.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** Total miss as they try and fire.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** And they're going to take...

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:27]** They're going to actually move back to behind the desk.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** They fire as they're trying to run away, which makes sense why they miss.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** They are trying to get behind the desk for cover.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** That's their turn.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Boom.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** What are you doing?

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** God, what a asshole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** All right.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** He's not entirely.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** He's not truly covered, though, from this perspective.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** Wait, how do I get the carousel?

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Oh, I found it.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Never mind.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** That's correct, John, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:48 - 00:52:17]** yeah they're not well he didn't make it all the way that far yeah where i was 15 feet away from you right i was right behind migo so could i have moved that far that was 20 feet so i could have moved one more five feet so they would have moved five feet i think so he he has cover now is that right yeah yeah he moved behind the desk for i would say probably just like a hat like what's the what's the minimum cover partial cuff not soft cuff partial cuff right i think it's partial cover


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:40]** yeah they just have partial because it's just a desk that's it if boom moves here like the line of sight where's here correct like uh i'm flagging it right now uh no because then you would have soft cover from miko right oh yeah yeah um okay so uh let's see what's boom's movement speed again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** I think I need to update this music.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** This is kind of tropical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Like we're driving Mario Karts on a beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** It's like a different kind of battle, you know?

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** What you gonna do?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** What you gonna do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Yeah, this is not really useful.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:57]** Good lord.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** How can grenades have such a low range?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** It's really annoying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:05]** Because it's only a 5 DC or AC or whatever to hit.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** So if you add plus 2, you could throw them...

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:30]** yeah you add plus what 10 you could throw it 25 times the distance that's not actual math but that's plus two for every range increment past what you want to throw it yeah so ac7 what kind of weapons what kind of weapons is that you so key has static arc pistol was the only one that you saw now you said my range is 35 feet for grenades is that what you just said


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** No, I think your range is 20 feet, but you're 35 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** So it's AC 7.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:39]** For two more range increments, it's DC 7.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:43]** So you could throw a grenade, and it would be DC 7 to hit that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** Yeah.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** You always aim at a corner.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** It's easy.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** You can blow up another desk.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Boom, gonna throw a grenade.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** Alright, so, um... F*** these desks.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:03]** Suffered a traumatic desk accident as a child, and now he's got a personal vendetta against desks everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** He was capped at a desk as, like, a kid.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** He was capped at a desk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** He was capped at a desk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** Until the USSR saved him.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Alright, so here we go.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** He's going to throw another incendiary grenade.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Yeah, from Morrow.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:24]** Alright, so Boom is like, another time for Boom.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:29]** And then he throws a grenade basically at the chair behind the desk.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** It's a pretty good spot to attack.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:58]** okay yeah um so i need to roll one again i'm sorry to like make sure you land that you need to roll your ranged ranged attack yeah d20 plus your i think it would be dex it you should have it in your hero lab okay just a moment um there's a lot of things in here now that weren't here yeah okay cool range attack all right so we have uh oh my god we have an eight

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** How?

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** That's all you needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:09]** No, I know, but I'm just so annoyed that I have such huge bonuses and I always roll a one plus my bonus.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** It's just annoying to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Wait, did you roll a one?

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:14]** Because that's a critical fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** I can't remember because I closed it.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** No, it's your range bonus.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** What's your range bonus?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** My range bonus is five, so I rolled a three plus five.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** So I'm going to throw... So you're good.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** That would suck.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** All right, so Incendiary Grenade is thrown, and it lands successfully where it's supposed to.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Uh-huh.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** It's an eight to attack, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:42]** It's an eight to attack, and it blows up the desk because you're aiming at the corner of the Yusoki and the desk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Yeah.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Roll your damage.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** It hits the desk.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Tink, tink, tink.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:51]** Knocking over some pens and pads as the desk faces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Unlocking the computer on the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Yeah.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** Starts playing the video that Yasuki was watching.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** I can't really roll for damage for some reason.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:05]** It was some NSFW stuff.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** You did.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Anything else you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** I don't really think I can do anything else.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** You can move if you want.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** Yeah.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** So the other Yosuke is in this doorway where Migo is currently chilling out.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Yeah, I can see that now.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Wait, question.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Did you have the grenade in your hand already?

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** Because you had a machine gun, and that's a two-handed weapon.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** So there will be a move action to draw it.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** To draw it.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** I like it.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:15]** You give him a chance and your path of destruction continues throughout the city of Morrow.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Yeah.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Yeah, classic.
