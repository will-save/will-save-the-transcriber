**[00:00:00 - 00:00:27]** ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:38]** welcome to universe of imagination between the bright light of the sun awakening on the packed worlds and the dark cold reaches of the vast where time and space can be suspended welcome you've come to the right place at the right time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** You're going to Wilson in the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** How could you?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Wilson in the room.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** That is your phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Kelly, that was so rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** I was trying to do something cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** And then from Japan, he's just like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** All right.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Sorry.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Okay.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** That was my bad.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** But it's just like that was the one time where the screen kept flashing black.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** It's because it's dumb like moisturizer commercial or something.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Let me turn on the news.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** Now you're going to explain what the heck you're talking about.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** That sucks.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** Especially our audio listeners are like, what the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** We're trying to put some light on my face, but I only have a TV here.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** A 30 to 40 inch TV?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** I don't know.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Why are we putting light on your face, Kelly?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Because that's what we like to do at Will Save.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** We like to give you an experience.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** Put it on like Channel 3 or whatever.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** I'm trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** It doesn't work.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Get the snow.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** Just the snow.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** Like a blanket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** This is not how it is in other places, necessarily.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Maybe.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** Yeah, there we go.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** All right, cool.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Feels like it could be.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** We're on a game show now, and the game shows are always really bright and happy, so I think we're okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Until it goes to commercial.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Shut up.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** Until they try to sell you another moisturizer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Kelly, where are you?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** Just for our listeners, Kelly is in Japan.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:50]** He had a lot of issues finally connecting on and he's using a TV as his key light.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:57]** So if you're watching us on Twitch, you can see the changing glows across his face as the moisturizer commercials come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:02]** I saw one the other day when I was looking for colored lights, which I don't have.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** I'm in Osaka in a place called Tsuruhashi.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** That's where I'm at right now.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Shout out to there, I guess.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** Let's play the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:17]** Is that another people group for us to denigrate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** No, let's please not do that.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:23]** At least, like, not while I'm here.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** Not while I'm here.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** After you leave.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** The next episode is going to be recorded.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Yeah.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** The moment that, like, my plane just, like, takes off.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** Like, it's just, like, a bunch of angry people running towards it.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** And then, like, I make it out just in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Yeah.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Well, well, amazing.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:55]** Also, can I just say, thank you, Kev, for, I just want to applaud Kev for using the correct term, key light, when Kev doesn't like new things and he doesn't like apps or, you know, but, or new, new jargon, but he very confidently was like, he needs a new key light.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** So, you know, it's good.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** I want some of my key lights constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Cause you made me buy some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** His lighting is good though.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** How many do you have?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** You have like two?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I have one here and one here.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, I need that.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Okay.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:13]** Do remember, everyone, we say it often, but it's worth bearing in mind that Kevin watches or he uses Hotmail.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** So just keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** I'm migrating away from that slowly.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** That's my spam account now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** He is.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** He is.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Yeah.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Slowly.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Slowly.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** You did ask me to change some of the calendar invites to my different email.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** I feel like I have Kev's Hotmail email, and that's the only one I...

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** So I guess I go straight to spam, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** No, no, no.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:41]** It's just like when I sign up for something that I don't want to be like really connected to it.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Like I only send the important things to.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** But, Will, you're important to me, so I'll send you my updated email.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Wait, what?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** What's your updated email?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** I'm not going to say it on our.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]** It's chaosmonkeyof.com.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Scratch that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** I already subscribed to his OS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:05]** Like it's, it's, it's not like murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:13]** Oh, if you're, if you want to know like how Kevin got the nickname chaos monkey, go to his OS and you'll see what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** We'll see exactly what's happening.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** We talked a lot about Kev's biceps on this show.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** And that Chaos Monkey O.F.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** We did?

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** We talked about whose biceps?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Kevin's?

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Kevin, flex your biceps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:32]** Was that an off-the-air conversation I just made on the air?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** No, dude, it's being highlighted by that key light.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** It's great, dude.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** It looks good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:43]** I'm a little bit pressed on that because, like, Kev has great biceps and, like, the only thing he curls is his son.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Yeah.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** My daughter, too.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:48]** People work really hard to get biceps like that.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Yeah.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** It's just like, I just live my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Come on, man.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Yeah.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:56]** I've literally been working out since I was 16 and my biceps don't look as good as Kev's.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:01]** And Kev goes to basic once in the Navy, right?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** And then like, easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** Half of Kevin is metal.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Like, literally and figuratively, right?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Because, like, you know, his face is, like, half metal.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** He literally is a fucking cyborg.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** They took part of that out.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** I'm good.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** We're going to call it the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Okay.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** So when you said you have biceps of steel, you meant that literally.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** They probably are literally steel.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Yeah, they literally are of steel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:31]** When you go through a Navy boot camp, they actually put in steel implants to make them look bigger to intimidate foreign navies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Do you just do that?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** Like, as the ship goes by, you just, like... That's true.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:42]** You just, like, do this, like, all over the deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Of the submarine underwater.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** It's even on top of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** It's a literal... It's a literal arms race.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** It's a literal arms race all around the world.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:07]** You, like, look on the radar skater and it's just a giant bicep coming down the... Sir, it's getting closer.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Well, cool.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** That was so much better than the other banter that I was thinking.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** So we'll save that one for next time.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** What were you thinking of doing?

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** I'll save it for next time.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Yeah, don't worry.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:26]** It'll be the next time that we're able to get there after we've said a lot about the people in the neighborhood that you're in.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** So it's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** So next time you're moving to a different location, right?

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** And you're going to then give us hints about what location you're at.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:35]** We should guess.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It's like GeoGuessr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** Yeah, I'm going to do a guesser, but it's Kelly Guesser.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Yeah.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** All right, yeah.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** For sure.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Next time we'll guess.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:47]** I kind of... So, like, you were saying your clue this time was the bag of rice, but then I didn't even use it because I said exactly where it was.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** But then next time I'll do another clue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Kelly, you... Oh, my God.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** You point the same way that you drink, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:53 - 00:08:00]** You, like... You, like... You, like... Always... Always with a strong... You do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** You know?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:08]** Actually, that about sums things up pretty well.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Securitas.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** That's a good way of putting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** I really want to try oboe rice.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** What?

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** What is omurice?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** There's a lot of that out there.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** How do we always come back to food?

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Kelly, do you want to describe it?

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** I feel like you probably have more context for it than I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:31]** Well, it's like a rice and then you kind of like sort of drip kind of basically a thin-ish omelet over the top of it.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:37]** And then very often you'll put on like a red sauce or even ketchup, which is kind of weird.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** You should come and get that.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** If anyone knows what Gudetama is, it's like a lazy egg kind of character.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** And I think he's kind of popular in America now, too.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:49]** They have like a Gudetama-themed restaurant.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** At least last time I was here, they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** That sounds so much like the... They call them Fro's.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:02]** There was the bowling alley on base in Hawaii made froze or fried rice omelets.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** And that's what it was.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** It was a very thin omelet.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:09]** They just put fried rice in the middle of it and then roll it up into like a fried rice burrito.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Yeah.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** It's so good.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** I love fried rice.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Because I want to learn how to make it.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:18]** It's closer to a French omelet.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:32]** where it's a really well-mixed omelet base or a whipped egg base, but they cook it so that it only cooks the outside, and you put it over the rice just like a French omelet, but you slice it down the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** And it opens, and there's sort of soft-done omelet on the inside.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** It's gooey.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** Oh, man.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Now I'm hungry.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** It's a beauty, and I just really want to eat it.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:52]** I want to learn how to make it because it looks really good, but it's also just, like, a simple, wholesome, like, it's a handful of ingredients.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** And it's a great, like, I don't know.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** I just want to try it.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** I want somebody to make Omer Rice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** We can definitely get it.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** That's possibly a new goal in the coffee is to just get some Omer Rice.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** You know, second show Omer Rice, same thing, same tier.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:13]** The thing, Benny, is that when I watch that cutting video of the egg, it kind of reminds me of those videos of, like,

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** you know, like a pimple popper.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** I'm so sorry, dude, but it definitely does.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:24]** It like, it always reminds me a little bit of like, you know, like the pimple popper videos where like, right.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:28]** It's just, it just, it really kind of grosses me out.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** Like it hits something deep within me a little bit.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** Is it too runny or something?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Is that why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:41]** No, there's just something about the way it breaks and folds open like a zipper and seems just a little short.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** What are you doing to your pimples, man?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I'm just saying it hits that chord for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Wait, you guys don't butterfly your pimples?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Is that it?

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, or anything that you have on your body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Now this is grossing me out.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** That's a weird idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Yeah, I'm going to disconnect.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** See you guys later.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:00]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** Go watch the video and you might see what I'm talking about.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Butterfly open pimples.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Is that the video?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Oh, God.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** No, that's not it.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** Please don't ever say that.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** It's probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** I mean, I don't even think of these videos.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** No one ever doesn't even cross my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:24]** I feel like the first time it hit the influencer sphere, everyone was like, oh, I got to go watch somebody do it.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** And then they're going to cut it.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** And it's kind of.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:31]** I mean, it's become a weird like it's it's oddly satisfying.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Yeah.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** The pimple popping videos.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** There's those.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** There's the the the nail cutting videos.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Yeah.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Wasn't there like the ingrown toenails?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** Oh, there's like Dr. Pimple or something is a pimple popper.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** That's a full-on show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** It's a TV show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** What channel is that?

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Discovery.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Discovery Channel.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:56]** Will's like... He's like, yeah, I've been a TVer for about four seasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** I got you.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Amazing, amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** There's videos to... Go ahead.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** I'm sorry.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:09]** The ones that I've been watching and getting served a lot are the tooth tartar cleaning videos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Okay, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Those are like...

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** If you've got any anxiety about mouth stuff, don't watch it.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** I love this stuff.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** It's like folks who haven't been to the dentist in like six years.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Okay.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** And the middles from their skin have like turned into rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** That knowledge that somebody out there.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Oh, God.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** It's wild.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** You're talking about they have like kidney stones in their gums?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Yeah, basically.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** It basically looks like that.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Yeah.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** Can we change the subject?

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:42]** They'll carve out your tooth to remove a cavity.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** It's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:51]** This kind of body horror is only fine in cybernetic augmentations that we're talking about in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** Before we hop in, one shameless plug for our coffee.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** We've started a coffee.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** Thank you to our listeners and to our supporters so far.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Yes.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:10]** One of the benefits of supporting us on coffee is the ability to write in a sentence for us to use in an episode.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:17]** Generally, we're looking for a sentence that's going to be funny or dramatic or might push the plot line along.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** Something whimsical you might want us to use as a punchline.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Or something very serious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** And I think you've got to kind of explain what exactly that is.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:28]** So you're going to submit as whatever... I forget what tier it is.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** You're going to have to correct me on that later.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** But you're going to submit your sentence, whatever that sentence may be.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** As a contributor.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** Yeah.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** As a contributor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** At the Scout Squadron and up tier.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:43]** I believe John will at some point assign that sentence to one of us.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** In the middle of the game.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Or at the start of the game.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:53]** We will typically have this discussion off the air before the end.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:00]** And the whole point of it is that our character will have to say that line in character at some point throughout the game.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:07]** So it's a fun improv game that we're trying to bring you to get you involved in our show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** Yeah.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:15]** Because one of our goals as a podcast is to invite and allow other people to join us at the table.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** This is another way for us to do that.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:27]** Thankfully, a friend of the podcast, Adam, gave us a write-in sentence that was not to be read in character.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:33]** So I'm going to go ahead and read it now if that's okay with you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Totally fine.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** I would love that.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** From your fellow Starfinders, keep searching the stars.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** Y'all are doing great and can't wait to see all your stories unfold three times even.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Thanks, Adam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Thank you.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Thank you.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** You rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** We appreciate you, Adam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** And you should also check out their incredible podcast, Strange Table Fellows.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Incredible podcast network.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Strange Table Fellows.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** They go hard.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Yeah.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Strange Table Fellows is very good.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Good people, friends of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:29]** i also want to in case we haven't thanked him yet uh cryo demon bought uh some merch through our merch shop uh maybe we already thanked him i don't know but in case we didn't thanks uh i think you personally i sent you a video or whatever but um but i hope you enjoy the tie-dye shirt and stuff and uh yeah and i like i want that shirt yeah that that's pretty good yeah well you've got some merch here share it okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** This is actually my favorite thing in the shop.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** These are all samples.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:41]** And so whether or not these make it, maybe that depends on supply and demand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:49]** While he's searching for that, I want to take a minute to shout out Will for being such a great merch designer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:53]** Every single thing he comes up with is tough.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:57]** Look at that Will Save the Universe floating on that bag.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** This bag.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** Like you're traveling to the packed worlds anywhere you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** You will not mistake your bag.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** There's no way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** Everyone will know what's happening with your bag.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** You will notice your bag, and everyone else will, too, actually.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** Everyone else will notice as well.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** So that's maybe the downside or the good side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** It's a good thing.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** It's a good thing.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Mess around and order that bag right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Truly.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:27]** I already messed around and ordered this hat, which is the Navy trucker hat, which I love greatly with the mesh back.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** It's rad.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** It's good.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** It's a long hauler.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** It's light.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** It's a long hauler.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** It's good.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** It's good stuff.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** I think I'm going to get one of those.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** It's a nice light hat.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** This hoodie, by the way.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:41]** Oh yeah, the hoodie with the we'll save the podcast on different elbows.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:46]** And the textless logo on the breast pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Boom.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** So tasteful.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** My best thing that I still have is the swim trunks.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** But that was a limited release.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:55]** There's a new swim trunk that will drop.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** There's a new swim trunk drop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:05]** Maybe because it's almost the anniversary of We'll Save, so we'll drop the swim trunks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** It is almost.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Yeah, it's true.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** It's very true.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** It's very true.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:13]** And also, if you don't at all purchase any merch or listen on a coffee, then thank you for listening.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** You are awesome and being at the table.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** We would love to see more of you.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** But either way, thanks for being fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** Somebody just won something on Kelly's show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** Yeah.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** The colors totally changed during that whole thing.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** That was the commercial.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** He was green.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** It was an ad.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** You know, it was good.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** All right.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** We've taken up time with this banter.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** Let's get rolling here.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Let us play.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:45]** And actually, before we play, I would like all of you to turn your attention to Foundry.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:56]** Because, Kelly, you had asked, I think it was an episode or two ago, you had asked to see the dinosaur agent who was attacking you in the museum.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** Come on, don't do this to me.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** He's so glorious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** He's so good.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** I don't see it.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Oh, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Oh, this is like a... Yeah, that's kind of cool.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** It's a Velociraptor Kotal Kahn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Yeah.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:17]** I heard that people elect to play this race.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** This is something I would definitely play in the future.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Absolutely.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** They look so ridiculous, but so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** What's that glow?

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** 100%.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Here's would be like, who are you?

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** How can I meet you right away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:34]** Can I please collect you on my giant ark of species I've never seen?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Just welcome aboard.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Sorry, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** I stepped on your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** What was your question, buddy?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** I was just wondering what the little blue glowy thing is.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** It's cool.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Part of the artwork.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Part of their costume.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** I didn't know if it meant something at all.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** Maybe his friend left him a soul in his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** It was a friendship necklace between him and his partner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** Maybe it's a super mysterious meteorite that they found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** It's not.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** It's not.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:02]** Nope.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** We're not even going to talk about that.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Nope.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** It's all good.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** We're not even going to open that can of worms.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** It's definitely a friendship necklace.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** That's all it's going to be.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:14]** Well, his friend's probably going to be really sad.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Taylor Swift concert.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Oh, yeah, that's it.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** He went with group necklace for T-Swift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** For the Beyond Tour.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** For the Eros Tour.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** It's a lot of Eros now that it's been going, but it's been going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:28]** This is actually kind of related.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Sorry.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:36]** According to Archives of Nethis, fun fact, these things are called Hanukkins.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Hanukkins.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:41]** And they shun technology.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Sounds like Hanukkah.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** They shun technology, so they sound like Kevin.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:49]** And instead, they utilize magic for societal and personal needs.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:58]** They have a symbiosis with adaptive bacteria that help raptor-like beings expand across their dangerously volcanic home planet.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:11]** They are also peaceful, and they carry mystical stones called synavers that hold symbolic religious significance and are sometimes magical in their own right.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** That's what it was.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** That's what it was around his neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** That's what it was.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:18]** And double as merch from an era sponsor.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Sean, you lied to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** You lied to me.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** You said it was a friendship necklace.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** I did lie to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Though curious, I'm very curious about this next part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** I'm going to take this next part of the necklace and throw it out this window now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** God dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** How could you do that to me?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:57]** they're instinctively curious and they have a culture of non-violence which does not explain why they attacked us so they're so they're golden retrievers is what you're saying yeah scaly feathered golden retrievers it does look like a dinosaur from dinotopia which is like there's too many series of that show it's uh it's not great there's also a book about it but it's interesting the book's a classic book i really like um the book is amazing isn't there a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Two books?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** There might be a whole series of them.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** Donatopia is like a... I thought there were at least two.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:06]** Like an iceberg I really need to keep understanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** There is at least one episode that we need to get to, so we should get to it.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** What?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Who knows?

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Let's play Good...

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Good drops there for Dinotopia.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Not shouted out enough, I always say.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** I'm always talking about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Yeah.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** And we need to wrap it, for real.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** I mean, I was discussing it yesterday at Intelligentsia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:36]** Just with the French salon of Intelligentsia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:44]** This is what happens when we have too much time between episodes and we just all want to hang out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:49]** I'm sorry this banter is like 40 minutes long.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** I think we're done with the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Yeah, I think that's it.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** You just want to do a banter episode?

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:02]** Yeah, a cat came through and changed and moved everything that was on my screen, so it's good.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** Such a cute cat, by the way.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Thank you.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Beverly's very cute.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** Very cute.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** All right.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** Let's get playing.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Let's hit it.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Let's play a game.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Yeah.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Let's play a game.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** You all are on foundry.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Good.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Get ready.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:24]** The warning that you were given only an hour ago.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:29]** Leora Huxley will die at sunset.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** The stars will lose a life.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** The gate will be satisfied.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:39]** Uttered by a member of the Integrated Future Front.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:52]** a guerrilla band of utopists who have read the texts that describe and outline a future rid of war, despair, and unhappiness.

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:01]** And they seek to bring it about by changing one by one the world of today to align with their holy text.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:11]** This was immediately after Leora Huxley, CEO of Ringworks Morrow, was taken hostage by the Integrated Future Front.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:24]** You all then have been tracked, or she was tracked by an emergency beacon to her new offices and residence high up near the cliff's edge of Morrow.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:40]** So you four, the STARS team, after dealing with an emergent interruption of your event at the Morrow Museum of History, you are now on a rescue mission to retrieve and save Leora Huxley.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** Let's hope it's not like the last times where...

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:50]** You might find her, but you might not find those IFF agents responsible.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:56]** Or worse, Leora is gone, but the perps remain.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:18]** So as your copter buzzes over the city of Morrow, as the sun begins to set for the last time for a month, you all can sense there's a little bit of conversation as Cecil's hesitation bubbles up.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** Nervousness at a new scenario.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** And as your dropship...

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** circles the roof.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** You all prepare to jump.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:34]** Kara, the leader, jumps with ease out onto the roof of the office building.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** Boom, leaps for what must be the hundredth time.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:44]** Miko plays it cool, rides it out for a second, waits a minute for the ship to stabilize, and then jumps.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:48]** And Cecil, the new blood...

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:59]** And leaps right as the ship rocks, leaving him missing the rope, free-falling in midair with his hands empty.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:07]** Before we go to this new map, Cecil, I need you to roll an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:18]** as you have now leapt from the dropship, trying to land and grab the rope and safely rappel down onto the roof.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** And Kevin's head is in his hands.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** I need you to not fail it.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** I set the DC low.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** You didn't get another crit fail, did you?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Not low enough.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** I rolled a natural one.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** Again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** No, he's dead.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** He's dead.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** I mean, I hope not, but come on.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** This can't be.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** We'll fall damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:43]** We could all just banter and Kev rolls a new character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** That's true.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** That would take the rest of the evidence.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** I can't believe that you have rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Okay.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** All right.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Here lies Cecil Remy 2024 to 2024.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:59]** Kevin, I need you to make a D100 roll, and this needs to not be the worst roll of your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** D100.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** It's a one again.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** Okay.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** What are the chances?

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** I didn't think I'd use this dice very often.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Let's see.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:12]** First I'll do... That's a 30.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** Plus... 8.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** 38.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** A 38.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:27]** Okay, Cecil, you are dead.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** You jump out.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:34]** Your hands, upon realizing that the rope is moving away from you, reach out.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:40]** And right as you extend and are about to grab it, the copter moves again.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** And your hands grab empty air.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:49]** And what is going through your mind as you realize that you're not going to grab the rope and that you are at least...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:49 - 00:27:15]** miles above the city floor and a good bit of feet above the roof of this building honestly honestly pure panic like absolute panic he just starts flailing and and reaching he's whips his tail trying to grab at it he's he's just he's lost in the air and i don't think it's enough time to actually have a thought before whatever bad happens happens


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** There's not.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:20]** You rolled a 38, so you didn't roll an absolute horrible roll.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:29]** But you did take 10 points of damage as you hit the top of the scaffolding that is 20 feet down.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:33]** And because you rolled above...

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:39]** 20, you are not in any danger of possibly rolling off the roof.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:45]** But I can say that I was willing to go there if you rolled poorly.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** I wanted to have you fail forward, man.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** But you're okay for now.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** This is 10 stamina points.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** That's not too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** He just drops way, way, way deep.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:00]** And then he passes by his house way the f*** down there.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:03]** And then it's like, okay, we're here to grab your child and hug him one last time.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Oh, you failed that too?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** Woo!

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** Oh, you failed?

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:07]** Oh, rough.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** That was rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Amazing.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Poor Cecil.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:23]** I love the mental picture of, like, the four of us each falling one by one and landing on our feet and running off, and then just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** It's like a cartoon.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Okay.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** New guys.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** You're not going to be a problem.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** It's not going to be a problem once we get inside, right?

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** No, no.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** That was the first time I've ever done this.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Jump outside of training.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Just entirely.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** He falls down.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:47]** We've been doing this every day for two years.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** It's not the same, though.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** That thing moved on me.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** Jumping out of the helicopters on camp, they don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Hey, Robbie, word of advice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Shake it off.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** Grab the rope next time.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Cecil, how far are you down?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Is half of your health gone?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** How are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** I'm all right.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** I'm all right.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Look, I'm good.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** I'll shake it off.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** I'll shake it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** All right.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** And he does that, and he starts shaking it off.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:14]** And as he does that, he uses his nanites to create a pulse caster rifle.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Let's go.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:21]** As that happens, Kara and Boom, you made perception checks at the end of last episode.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** They weren't high enough.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** What were you perceiving again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** If anyone was there, right?

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** So they weren't high enough, now people are here.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** You made perception checks.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** So we're surrounded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** Hey, what didn't we sense last episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Tell us about what we didn't see.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** From a meta perspective.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** It's just a bunch of those dinosaurs.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** I'd be happy if that were the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** They're peaceful and friendly and curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** Hey.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Kara, what is your KSC?

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** 17.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** What is your KSC?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** It's 19.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** 19.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Okay.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Kara.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:24]** Right as you are standing there on top of this new office building, on the scaffolding that's still at the top of the building, there is a quill that hits the scaffolding next to you.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** Purple with this liquid starting to come off of it.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:37]** And boom, you look down after looking at Cecil, and there's a similar quill coming out of your leg.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:43]** You are going to take eight points of piercing damage, and I need you to give me... No.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Kara, you're good.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:47]** Boom, you need to take eight points of piercing damage.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Wait, why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** I have a higher KDC than Nita.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Is it just because of the location?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** You need to take eight points of piercing damage, and I need you to give me a fortitude save.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** And I want you to fail.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** I also don't want you to fail, but I do want you to fail at this.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** And I need everyone to go ahead and roll for initiative.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** I hold your horses.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** No, you hold your horses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Fortitude save?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:31]** yeah fortitude save all right uh that's a nine that is a nine i guess all right initiative you don't know what happens for now uh we'll see what happens next literally okay we did everything right and we almost got hurt as much as cecil who did everything that is like horrible


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:35]** I distracted you guys enough that you ended up... John Lee Picardo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Picardo rolled an 18.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Okay, give me one second.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:42]** I'm going to put you guys into the order here, and then I will reveal this new map.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:48]** And we'll be good to go while I'm doing that.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Kara, you got an 18.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:59]** I do want to shout out something that on Foundry, I did add in a feature for you to make rolls where you can roll your own die and type in the individual number.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** So in case you guys are interested in that, let me know about that.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:08]** While I ask for initiatives, I'm going to give you guys the new map.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** Ooh.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:16]** Yeah, you should see a rooftop in the setting sun above the city of Morrow.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** I just see loading the new office.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** Loading the new office.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** Kara got an... Let me go to my roll here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:33]** Kara got a... Ooh, look at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:39]** Cara got an 18.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** Do you guys want to describe the map real quick while I'm putting things through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:47]** So like you said, it's definitely a setting sun.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:51]** So everything is kind of coated in a gold color.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** But it looks like we're on the top of a very, very, very tall building.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:05]** And on top of that, it's beautifully laid out because it's several tiers of scaffolding type catwalks.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** So we're on the very top catwalk.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** There's a second layer below us.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** And then below that is actually a deck.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:17]** And then it looks like there might be some seats and stuff down the bottom right-hand corner, maybe tables.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Yeah.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Nice little lunch spot.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** It's giving old-school Donkey Kong vibes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Old-school DK vibes.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** I love it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** I love it.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** And also, to your right, Archie, as...

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:58]** who as you stand up you see or Cecil you see Archie who is the drone floating next to you it's probably like I don't know less than a foot by a foot by a foot and has this this clear body with these two sets of wings top upper and lower and these like three red eyes that as it flows it turns and sees you and then you're able to hear this voice in your commune and say Cecil

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** You doing it right there?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** And it's the voice of Commander Bolt.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** I'm fine, Commander.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Okay.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** All right.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:07]** Okay, Kara, you got an 18 on your initiative.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** What did Boone get?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:30]** six got a six what did me go get dirty 20 dirty 20 okay what did cecil remy get i got a flat 20 with no bonus um where do i where you said we could put this in ourselves i just added it in you uh we are starting combat and you should see i wanted to learn how to do it myself

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:43]** You can click on your character, and I believe that you can right-click and either update or you can roll initiative yourself here if you add in your bonus on Foundry.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** But let's get into that in a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** I tried to change it to 40, and it didn't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Great.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Thank you for that.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:57]** Kara and Migo, you all see that there's this creature, probably about the size of an eagle.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Pretty large.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** One is on the lower set of scaffolding to your left.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** One is on the lower set of scaffolding to your right.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** And they look... I'll just share the image.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** They look wild.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Yeah.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:23]** Because they have this, like, four angry eyes sitting above several mandibles as the head of this, like, arthropod crab starts to come into view.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** Has a crab body, tiger stripes with a pair of wings with white feathers.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:36]** There are crab claws in the front and a humongous stinger dripping with venom in the back.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** It's like the chimera of nightmares.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:41]** These things are crazy.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** And it's going to be Migo's turn first.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** What are you doing?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:48]** You're standing 20 feet up above the roof on scaffolding.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Currently, I'm staring at this photo.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** You can close out of it.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Everything dangerous in Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:00]** That's so true.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** I think Migo is going to...

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Spot these two threats.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Uh-huh.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** And let's see.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Yeah, what's it going to be?

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** A little bit longer.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** Sorry, I'm checking my mutations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Abilities.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** I've got to wait one more round to do that.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** So he's going to double move.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** He's not one to hesitate to act.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:33]** He's not great with his tongue, but he is great in a fight.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:45]** So he's going to double move to go to the ladder to the right and then climb down that chute and just go straight face to face with this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Toe to toe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:49]** Scorpion, lobster, eagle, tiger.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Abomination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** Yeah, abomination right there in front of you.

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:00]** As it comes down, you can see that part of its body, out of its chitinous, arthropod body, where parts overlap.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:08]** There's more of that purple goose that you might have seen stuck in there, just leaking out of its body.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** And it's...

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** It starts to clap its claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** As he's running over there, you hear a mumble under his voice.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Let me at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** Let me at him.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Let me at him.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I'm coming for you.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** I feel like you did the slide down the ladder, too.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Cool.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:24]** Double move.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Going in to fight the one on the right.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** You're collecting yourself.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** You just stood up.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** I'm trying to figure out.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** So is that a climb speed to get down a ladder, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Yeah, I mean, let's see.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:43]** It's 10 feet, so what would that climb speed be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I can't read this.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** What?

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** You can't read what?

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** 500 to see how far.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** So 20 feet over to the ladder, and then the ladder is how far down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** The ladder is 10 feet down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** So can I do that in one move then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** I mean, you could probably move down.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:08]** I think there might be a DC to, to kind of ladder, but I don't think you guys need to, I'm, I'm going to wave that and say that you don't need to worry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Sweet.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Okay.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** So in that case,

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:19]** He's going to just, Cecil's going to kind of just dart right underneath and almost like push the drone out of the way.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Yeah.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:24]** And he's got his pulse caster rifle trained on that thing.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** And he's like, hostile, president.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** And then he put it like changes back into his hand.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** Yeah.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** And he pulls out his pike rifle.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:37]** And it extends out into a full staff as he slides down that ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Can I just say that there is a DC?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** It's DC 5 to climb down a ladder.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** Maybe just both of you give me a quick climb check.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** I automatically pass.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Oh, it's athletics?

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** I don't automatically.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** It's athletics.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Cool.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** So I do want to keep that in there because it's so low.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Might happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Might happen.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Cool.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** I'm much better at ladders than I am at ropes.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** I got a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Okay.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** A lot better.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Okay, cool.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** All right.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** All right.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** So in one move, I'm down.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** And with that, I'm going to ready an attack on this thing.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Okay.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** And if it enters, and I do have reach on my pike.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:24]** So if it moves at all towards us, even one square, I will be able to get an attack on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Wow, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** That's impressive.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** Okay, rad.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Rad, rad, rad.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:45]** And then just, I might as well say it now so we don't forget, Vinny, I have Swarmer, which says that you gain a flanking ability if you are just threatening an ally or a foe that I'm threatening.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** So if we're both threatening, it doesn't matter where you are, you also gain flanking.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** That's dope.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Yo, that's cool.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Yeah.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** And so I have reach on my weapon.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:57]** And so if, if I am behind you, you also gain that flanking.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** So just saying.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** All right, mouse, we're going to, we're going to be real good friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** As this thing claps towards you.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Okay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:12]** Both Cecil and Miko going to gang up on this defenseless beast.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** Super innocent beast over in the corner just trying to live his life.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** Kara, what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:27]** Kara is going to move past Boom and perch up towards the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Oh, nice.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:33]** Okay, so I love that you just start running along the scaffolding.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** It's like the highest point on top of the roof.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:42]** If you went over one side, I feel like you just have no fear of falling, right?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** You're just like, let's go.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Yeah.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:52]** And then I would assume that I could at least... I probably can't see the one below me yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** Not from where you're standing now because you're right at the corner.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** You probably need to move one more square and then you can look over and see it.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** Then I'm going to just double move to get like right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Oh, just right on the edge.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:05]** Love it.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Yeah.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Okay.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:12]** I guess that's Cara's turn and she's going to, I mean, yeah, she can't do anything.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** That's double move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Okay.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:18]** Okay, so you double move, but you don't move right to the edge, which is awesome.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:23]** Looking down almost directly, literally directly on top of this beast.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Yeah.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:37]** Okay, it is going to be the creature's turn that is right near Migo and Cecil, and it is absolutely going to take a step forward, which I believe triggers that ready to attack, right, Cecil?

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Sorry, say again?

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** You said that your ready to attack was if.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yeah, yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** So it's...

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** Sorry, I was trying to figure out how to pull up my chat box.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:52]** So yeah, the thing moves in and I'm curious.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Do you want to do a life science?

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** No, I was going to attack.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:02]** But so Cecil's behind Migo.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** And so is that cover?

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** Yeah, that's definitely, I would say soft cover.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** Is that plus four or minus four or whatever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:19]** No, I thought soft cover was a... Soft cover is a bonus to the AC, but not to the reflex save.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** So it's a plus four to my AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Right.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** So you get a plus four.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Yep.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** But then I have a plus four to hit.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** So we'll see how that works out.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Don't make it harder than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** You also get a plus two from your swarm flanking.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** What's it going to be?

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** That's a 19 on the die.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** So that's a total of... That's KAC.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** So that's a total of 25 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** I'm not going to make you not get a hit on 25 in the first combat.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** As you drop on the roof, that's wild.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** I wouldn't do that ever.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Definitely not.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** For sure.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** Wait, what?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** What are you saying?

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** It's a hit.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** That's all you need to know.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** It's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:10]** That is... I'm doing this as using... I'm also Merciful Striker, which reduces the penalties of attacks for non-lethal.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** So technically, it would have been a minus 4 for that, but it's only a minus 2.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Oh, nice.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Just for the record.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** So this is a 1d8 attack.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:26]** It's a six on the die, plus seven is 13 points of damage.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Okay, and what did you do?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** You swung at it?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:35]** No, I think he kind of just stabs, like, literally between Migo's legs.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** Just goes and stabs at this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:44]** Literally hits the beast right between the eyes, and it falls dead.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** No.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Not dead.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** It falls unconscious.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Unconscious.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Are you sure?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Yes.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** Merciful Striker.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** It is unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Add one to Rick19's kill count.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** It is not dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** It's not dead.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** It's not dead.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Okay.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Okay.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:07]** But you do have to move me in initiative order now to that location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Okay.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** You are absolutely right.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** So I will update you right now.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** Boom.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** To be right before, right?

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Okay.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Got it.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Gotcha.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** You have been moved, sir.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Okay.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:25]** Kara, you're looking at this beast like 10 feet below you.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:30]** And this was the beast that hit Boom.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:35]** And you see it line up and watch this like...

**[00:44:35 - 00:45:00]** stinger just start to coil back in nature's kind of perfect way where it makes everything efficient and then throw another coil at boom boom i'm gonna need you to let's see here you can really get this far away accuracy of this thing done hey you know what it's pretty good it's pretty good

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** Okay, your KC was 17, right?

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** 19, sir.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** 19, sorry.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** It flies by you and hits...

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** The structure behind you.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Cecil is down there.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** It completely misses you.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** That is its turn.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** It is focused on you.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** And boom, it is your turn.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:30]** And I'm going to say, boom, I think it's appropriate that you went last because you are one step down the dexterity poison track.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:37]** You are currently sluggished as you got hit with the poison from this beast.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:43]** So you get a minus two penalty to reflex saves, dex-based checks, attack rolls, and skill checks.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** And you're flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** That was a ranged attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** That was a ranged attack.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** This is so messed up.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** All right.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:55]** Do I have anything to, like, Serum of Healing, I guess, would... But I don't... It would not do that.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Would not do that.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Antitoxin, I guess, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:06]** And antitoxin gives you a bonus to the roll that you're going to need to remove the poison, but you will stay at this stage for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** All right, all right.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** I'm just checking one more thing to make sure that you're not wrong.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** A weekend?

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** All right.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** I just want to make sure that I want to see if I can do this.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** It looks like I can't.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** For sure, yeah.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Thank you.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** I really am very happy with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** It's kind of like I did my prep.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Yeah, no, no, no.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** It's good.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Yeah.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** All right, cool.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** Well, Boom, I guess, is going to take all that matters.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** He wants to shoot this thing, so that basically means he takes a minus two to his attack roll.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Minus two, correct?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Yeah.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** You have a minus two to your attack roll.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:42]** Boom trains his gun, and he just takes a puff.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Let's make this nice and easy for you.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** That's a 24 to hit.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** Did I break my terrible streak with guns?

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** You did.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** With the minus, it's a 22.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Does that hit?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Yes, that hits.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** That hits.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** I thought so.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** I just wanted to be sure.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** And that's 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:11]** Since it was so accurate at hitting me in a specific part of my body because it's so good at that in an annoying way, I just want to go straight through one of the eyeballs of it.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Just to cause a particular discomfort.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** That's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Flies through the eyeballs.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Discomfort.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:32]** Kara, you see a splash of purple goo that just, as the beast is decimated, leaving the remnants of it on the floor.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Well done.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** That is what you get, sticky boy.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** The threat is over for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Are you hurt?

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** What?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** You're talking to me?

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** Yes.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** I am hurt.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:53]** I have lost some life and some health, and I am flat-footed.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** It's hard for me to move and breathe.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Everything hurts.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Do you have something to add?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:04]** I think you do need to make another check in order to not continue.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Yeah.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:10]** And you do have an antitoxin, which will give you a bonus to that save.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** I have an antitoxin.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** It's DC14.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** It's a DC14 Fortitude save.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:22]** If you can make that save, because now we're moving out of initiative order, so technically you would keep taking that save.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:30]** You keep moving down the track unless you... Unless you do an... Unless you pass the set.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** And we should each... Yeah.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:37]** I think we each have an anti-toxin because it was in the kit.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Yeah.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:45]** So just... I think we talked about it last time, but just for the listener, John gave us like a loadout kit that each of us got the same exact kit.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** And then we got to kind of pick and choose which weapons and armor we wanted.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** But all the equipment in there, one of them is an anti-toxin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** So...

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** I have this.

**[00:48:53 - 00:49:00]** It says when you take or inject it with an antitoxin, you gain a bonus equal to three plus the medicinal tier to saving throws against poison.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** So the tier is one, right?

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Item level one, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Yeah, so you get a plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** To my fortitude save?

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:13]** And if we were to stay in initiative order, it would be Migo and then Kara and then Cecil.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:19]** So are either of you going to try and give... Like, what do you do on your turns?

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Because that was...

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** Boom's turn was shooting that standard action.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** So we're still in initiative order, you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:31]** Yeah, just because you're still going to be taking that serum, right?

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** Right.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** And trying to pass the safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** In order to resolve this poison, I think.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** In order to, yeah.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** I don't think Migo knows Boom was hit.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** Okay.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** And hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** The pain.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** You sound like a soccer player.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** That still hurts so bad.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** Revy, is that you complaining?

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** No, it's me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Boom.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** How could this happen to me?

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Boom, of all people.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** I don't know why I sound like Christopher Walken is Russian now, but whatever.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** So, he's just dying on his own.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** It's making me talk in accents.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Turn it off.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Kara, it's your turn.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** Do you do anything on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** How could you not help me?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** What do you need?

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Yeah.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** I mean, I would just use my own antitoxin, right?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** I would just use my own antitoxin and a fortitude save.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** I don't need someone else's.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Boom's not like a, you know.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** Okay.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** He can handle it.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** Okay.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** Are you going to be okay?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** We're just going to trade antitoxins anyway.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** I mean, it's all the same, isn't it?

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** It's the end of the day with that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** He was being melodramatic.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Guys, help me.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** I'm dying.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Oh, my God.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Just kidding.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** No worries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** That is what you all say here is joke.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** I made funny.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** So, Cara, do you do anything on your turn?

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Is there still danger?

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** What's the turn?

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** What do you mean?

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** So, we're saying in the turn order because technically Boom has not passed his Fortitude save.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:00]** So, Boom could fail and fail and fail and keep moving down the poison trail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Get a little bit more Ace Ventura every turn.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Got it.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** So that's why.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Whoa, wait.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:14]** Can I send you like... Is it a treat disease?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** What is this?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Drugs or poison?

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** It's a poison.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:22]** Give him a plus four bonus if I do treat drug and poison.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:28]** If I succeed, receives a plus four bonus to saving throw against a drug or poison.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Is that a medicine check?

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Yeah.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** It's a treats drugs or poison.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:38]** As a standard action, you can use medicine to treat drugged or poisoned creature.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:42]** requires a med kit, a medical lab, or a medical play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Do we have med kits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** I don't have a med kit, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** I think that you would have probably gotten a med kit.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Well, yeah.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** You might not have gotten one.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** I don't think we do.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** I think John didn't give it to us.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** But truly, would it make sense that you would have had one?

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** One person.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:04]** Somebody would have had one if we communicated better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** I think one person would have had it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** So who likely would have had it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** I think Kara would have had it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** I think Kara actually probably would have had it.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Who has a medicine skill trained?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** I have a plus five in medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Okay.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** I have a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** Let me check.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** I have...

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:34]** I think I have a med kit somewhere in my backpack, but does anyone know how to use it?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Where does this end go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** Remember he broke it when it landed from the helicopter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Yeah.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Crushed it.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** It is me.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Boom.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Friend of everyone.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** I guess you could assist, right?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** If only someone had a med pack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** We're still in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** I was joking about joking before.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** It was double funny.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** My climb speed's real low, so it's going to take me two turns to get up the ladder.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:57]** Just kidding.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** I don't know what the climb speed is.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** All right.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** So let's just â€“ can we just fast forward a little bit?

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** Like, yeah, you just call for medic.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Remy would be the medic, I guess, in this case.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:15]** And so he's going to make his way up the ladder and over to Boom and say, like, hey, what's going on?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** That's fine.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** I was poisoned by â€“ So I'm adding a med kit.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Does that give you any bonus?

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I don't remember.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** I don't even know where to add it at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:27]** Yeah, so you have to make â€“ for now, we can add it in later.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:31]** For now, you would need to make a D20 roll.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** A medicine check.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** Yeah, make a full medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** That's a 13 total unless there's a bonus from the med kit that I don't have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** No, not from the med kit itself.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Okay.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** It's DC-14 poison, man.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:47]** So you don't give the plus four, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** I can't, as an antitoxin, give it to someone else who's treating me?

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:55]** Or if I inject it in my body, does that help someone else treating me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:58]** No, you get the antitoxin, and that gives you a bonus to your save.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:04]** I was doing a medicine check to help you with an additional bonus to your save, and I failed.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Because I'm not really a medic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Your nerves are afraid from landing and fighting and getting down.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I'm just a mouse.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** I'm just a mouse.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** I'm not a medic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** What was the DC?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** It's DC-14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Oh, man.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** I would have crushed that just now.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** I am also a mouse.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** I understand.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:23]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** It's your turn.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** I literally... All right.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** So people are trying... All right.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** Boom injects the antitoxin, and then I think rolls a fortitude save.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** That's what boom would do, right?

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** And you get a plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Because of the antitoxin.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** And then fortitude save is plus five.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** So God willing, if I don't... It's a 23.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Does that beat this poison track off?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** You do... I'm sorry about the phrasing of that.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I didn't mean that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** Bro, that voice jack has never been happier, man.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** It's over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** It's so over, it'll just leave me alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** It's so over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Get off me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:05]** You do see that at the injection site, some of that purple ooze begins to just fade away and move back into the color of your skin, become less angry and irritated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Oh, finally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:12]** Archie comes over, and you hear Commander Bolt's voice say, Boom, are you okay?

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:19]** Yeah, it was poisoned, but I will not say it the way I said it earlier.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** I did not beat it off.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** I resolved it.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** It is no longer affecting me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** I don't need your life story there.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** I just want to make sure that you're okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Whatever you do in your downtime is whatever you want to do.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Well, I'm on clock right now, so we are good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** All right, let's keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Let's get on with it then.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** So what do you guys do?

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:47]** I rolled a perception check like half an hour ago, and I rolled a 10, so I probably don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** Yeah, I mean, you â€“ okay, so you see that you're about 20 feet up.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:56]** There's scaffold 20 feet up, 10 feet up, and then down to the top of the roof.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** It's a pretty mechanical roof.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:03]** There are some barrels and cylinders that are casting long shadows in the â€“

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:15]** In like the sunset time here, there appears to be a landing pad off to the left as well as a little mechanical raised area with some consoles off to the left south of that.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:24]** And along the way, you see one area on the right that looks to be a little outdoor patio, maybe three feet up.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:28]** a couple steps up, and there's a door from that patio leading in somewhere.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** And you can see that there are two.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** That's a double door.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:37]** And you see that there are two single doors in the middle of the map and to the left of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** Do we have a layout of this building?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** I'm working on it right now.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:44]** Why didn't we use the landing pad?

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Just ask him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** That's a good question.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** Let's get on with this big landing pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** I'm not the pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Someone asked the pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Trying to get in covertly.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** All right.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Are we ready?

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Yeah, you're not paused.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** You are good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** What do you want to do?

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** Migo, loose the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** Okay.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:09]** There's nothing there unless you want to craft some stuff with poison.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:14]** You can maybe pull out a sack to find, like, you know, poison sack in the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Yeah.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Migo pulls out a poison sack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Okay.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** You're going to beat that poison sack off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Beat that poison sack right off.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:22]** Love it.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Awesome.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Got to beat the poison out, guys.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Okay.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:33]** Migo is going to climb down this ladder and have a look at this patio that you mentioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:39]** Yeah, Kara's going to move down the ladder and motion the rest to come down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Okay, because Boom will also do this.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Where is entrance?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:53]** Yeah, I see a double door over here, and there's a single door off to our right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** There's two doors over here, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** Are we still waiting on schematics?

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** I'm not going to have them right now.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** All right.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:06]** Seems like something we should probably have at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** There's one here.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** I'm working on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** There's two more down here.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Hang on.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** You all are trained for this.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** What do you think?

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** Are we going guns blazing or are we trying to stealth this?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** Do I have a med kit basic or advanced?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Advanced is a level five item, so I could have it.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** I think you would just have a basic.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:33]** It feels like the advanced is a lot to just be carrying around with you.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** That's like a full pack.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** It's like its own backpack.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** That's all you got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** I think it's just sharper scalpels.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:45]** And then... It has more gauze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** It has more gauze.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Wait, where's Migo at?

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Oh, you're up there.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Okay.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** I think now that we're down here, I want to make another perception check.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** I'm looking for cameras or audio devices.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** Okay.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** That's a natural one.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** I don't see shit.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** You don't see anything.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Stop rocks today, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** Migo, what are you doing up there on that patio?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** I'm looking for any evidence that it was recently used.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:16]** So, like, condensation on cups, warm food, things that would have blown away.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** A cigarette.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** A lit cigarette.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Blown away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:25]** No, if anything, it looks very unused.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:26]** Okay.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** Looks like brand new.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** Like there are things that are arranged on there as if no one has ever used them before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Got it.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:36]** Hey, this place is fresh and dusty.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** There's been no activity up here recently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Can we...

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Can we see the doors?

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Can we see through them?

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:46]** Are there any windows or anything like that looking into the building?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:53]** The door that Migo is in front of is opaque, but it is kind of semi-transparent.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:58]** You can make out that there's a larger space behind it, but you can't see too much in there.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** But, Migo, you did walk closer to the door, right?

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]** Yeah, I did step closer as, like, yes.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:15]** As you walk closer to the door, there does appear to be some sort of movement deeper in the room.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:22]** It seems like the light is starting to play, and you look around, and there's one source of light behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** It's the sun setting.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:28]** But behind the door, there's something happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]** And that's our game.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** I love the new little 8-bit.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** It's so good.
