**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Coming in hot.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Lecrae and Eminio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:42 - 00:02:04]** that's a bang i don't know who you're who are you talking about i don't know what that is benny i don't care about music that isn't creed or nickelback so let's settle the age-old question which is better creed or nickelback creed is better clearly nickelback nickelback is so boring i feel like they scream me to sleep like i can't explain it it's just so bad


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:25]** wait nickelback puts you to sleep but creed it does it's just like music there's variation in their songs i know but and yet he's able to like provide some kind of like peaks and valleys in his song where it's just like i'm a photograph like that's the entire tone the entire way a photograph section that is their best song

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Okay, it is the best of Nickelback, though, which is sad.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** It's not the best of Nickelback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** What's the best song of Nickelback?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** What is Nickelback?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** You can't even remember it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** I just want to pause so we can quote that.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:40]** Kevin just said, I can't remember Nickelback's best song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** I mean, it's a top song.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I'm trying to remember how you remind me.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Yes, how you remind me.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Oh, I hate that song so much.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** I hate it.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** That's a good song.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** It's a good song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Did you know that Creed is from Tallahassee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:57]** I feel like I have one foot in the Creed camp already.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** I came into this argument with one foot in the Creed camp because they're from down the road.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:25]** yeah from the same places as teddy we're debating like below mediocre bands it's just which of them is less mediocre i think i think creed hit me at the right age dude that's why it hits that all their songs hit i'm just saying they're way more successful than anything that we've ever done though right nailed it yeah nailed it that we've done so far yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** We got some bangers coming out, guys.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:32]** If we measure success by the fun that we've had as a cast, I think we're pretty successful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** And Creed has zero fun.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** They're not a fun band.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** It's well known that they have no fun on all their tours.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** What is that?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Never.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** They lay around in boats.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** What are you talking about, Kevin?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Here's where this is coming from.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:53]** When I'm working, I usually put on music videos on YouTube.

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:02]** Instead of doing today's top hits and stuff like that, I just Googled or YouTubed 90s rock.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:08]** And for whatever reason, I got stuck in a loop of Creed and Nickelback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** It was four Creed songs and four Nickelback songs.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** And I was like, get me out of here.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** And I finally got into it.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** This is Groundhog Day 2.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Side by side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** This is Groundhog Day 2.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** It's just you only listening to these songs.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** It's the only songs that play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** When people talk about purgatory, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:29]** Except I would have a great time because they're awesome.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:53]** kelly this started off well half of it's awesome this started off as like you know we listened to a pearl jam song and and then we were like yeah how dare you how dare you besmirch


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** This is what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** This is what I'm saying.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:59]** I said Pearl Jam is what would happen if Nickelback was good.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** That was what I said.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** I was like, this is the potential that Nickelback really tried for, but they failed.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** It was like the Cecil fall, right?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** Like Cecil could have landed in a very, very good way.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:12]** And yet he failed just miserably all the way down horribly rolling, you know, crit fail after crit fail.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** That's Nickelback to me.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:19]** Whereas if he did, like, a somersault and a flip and landed on, like, two feet in a good way, that would be perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** And who is Creed to you in comparison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Creed's smashing pumpkins.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:28]** Smashing pumpkins?

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** Just dust that one off there.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** I don't know.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** I don't know.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** Adam's going to love this banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** Somewhere between there and Incubus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:40 - 00:06:04]** nickelback is from hannah alberta see they're not even alberta so if you if you're like up on your canadian lore shout out to canadians shout out um shout out yes we're very happy this is where we're not trying to make fun of you they are i'm saying like alberta bound yeah yeah they're always alberta bound always for life is that a nickelback song


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Is that why they're bad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** Is it that they're trying to sound like they're from the South or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Is that why?

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** But they're not from there?

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** If you have a minute, you should watch A Bird Abound.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Gordon... Paul Brandt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yeah, Paul Brandt.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** It must be a Gordon Lightfoot song, but...

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Paul Brandt kills it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** It's a shockingly good banger.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Dude, it's a banger.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:40]** Because the five of us were there, Will did this song karaoke with Mrs. Will at John's wedding.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** And it was a banger.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** It was a banger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** And she's not sorry about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Not sorry at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Wait, are we talking about...

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** So did this or Will did this?

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** That changes the whole meaning of that song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Changes the whole meaning.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** Everybody, go listen to John's song, OIS.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** It's on Spotify.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** And imagine having sex to it.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Or try having sex to it.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** It's fine.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** We don't.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** We don't.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** Let's go with dumpster fire.

**[00:09:59 - 00:09:59]** Okay.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** We're too hot for TV.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I love when Will puts the kibosh on stuff.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** If he doesn't really want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** Too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** He's like, nah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** I feel like what else would be really bad?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** Like, Chumbawamba would be bad to f*** too.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** Also, like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** I feel like that would be... That's enough.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** It's been ten minutes of this.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** We'll save the podcast.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** You should do something that would be... Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Sorry, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** That is a really f***ing good... We're not sexy music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** I like some jazz.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** How did we miss this this entire time?

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** I like some jazz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** Listen, if you want to f*** to We'll Save, that's what you should f*** to.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Just f*** to one of our episodes.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** I personally recommend Unknown Treasures.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I don't want to hear about it.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Episode 29.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** That's, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Right when Snake Boy comes on, it's like, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Like, that's like the best part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** You didn't even go to episode 69, which is where we finished episode 2.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** That's true, that's true.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** No, episode 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** What was I thinking?

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** Could you imagine f***ing to the sound of your own voice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** Like, that's just... I used to explicitly do that.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** That was all I would ever do.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** I'd have headphones in.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Oh my god.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** You just turn it up louder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** I'm sorry, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** Do you record yourself talking you up like a pep talk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** You're doing great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** You got this, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** Is Kevin like Tony Robbins unto himself?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** That would be amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:52]** So basically, you have to just record it onto this track.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Right now, this episode.

**[00:11:53 - 00:12:05]** And this episode will be the one that we recommend for... If you've never listened to Wolf Save, start with episode 95.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** I was going to start my own Spotify.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** It's just ASMR motivation videos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** It's one listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** Encouragement.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Dad was wrong.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Dad was wrong about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Oh, my God.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:36]** Speaking of having sex, what's going on behind that window?

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Wow.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** All right.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** That's a good place to call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:47]** In case any of you wonder, yes, this is exactly how we are when we're all together in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** This is exactly it.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** This is exactly it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** I feel like it's worse.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** I feel like it's worse here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** It's hard.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** I think the fact that we know we're going to be talking to people... I think we try harder here to make each other laugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** I don't think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:28]** I don't know if we try it's just like I just feel like we know that it's I think we're always on the verge of like how far can we take it before we get cancelled and I think that makes us like want it slightly when people ask what episode got you cancelled we'll be like oh episode 95 we didn't even say anything bad about any location we didn't even get into the episode we just talked about a bunch of copyrighted material from well respected artists


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** Until we got into a discussion about fornication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** This is already the episode with the most bleeps.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:43]** And depending on whether we can air the name of that copyrighted material, it might become even more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** Sure, you can air the name of the song.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Come on.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** All right.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Well, you guys did ask about the hat.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** This is my flex fit.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** We'll save the podcast hat.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** So if you're still listening to the show, it looks good.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** Go ahead.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Go to shop.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** We'll save the podcast dot com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** You get your real good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** You can follow us on Discord at discord.willsaythepodcast.com.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:11]** And you can also support us on coffee.willsaythepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:17]** Where you can write in a sentence saying your favorite song that you listen to.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Make love to.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** In your private time.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Okay?

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** In your private time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** Also, we can recommend the Will Save merch.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** As you can tell on Kevin, it probably looks really good on him while he's f***ing.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** So I'm just saying, like, the Will Save merch while it's on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Yeah, you look great.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Yeah, you look real good.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** You look sick in that hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** There you go.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:45]** I'm going to drop a separate episode, 95.1, that's just Kev saying very encouraging, poppy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** That's definitely what's going to happen.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** That's definitely, definitely what's going to happen.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** She likes you for your personality.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** And your body.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Your biceps look spectacular.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Those biceps are steel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** Doing all those curls really paid off.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** You look sexy even when you fall 20 feet.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** Is that a nuclear reactor in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Yeah.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:21]** Is that a uranium rod?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:33]** Last time, you were super sexy taking out these two beasts on the top of a sunset rooftop, looking hard as f***, blowing their brains out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** I mean, we did pierce through them pretty quickly, too.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** I was ready to move on.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** It was so much damage.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** I mean, one time that one f***ing bug thing was tapped out, dude.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Did you hear Nickelback?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Come on.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I'm a PA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Did you hear Nickelback?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:05]** That's what's blaring as you land as the copter flies away.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:23]** You are in the infiltration stage of this hostage scenario as you are jumping into the new offices of Ringworks Morrow on the rooftop near the top of the Morrow Canyon Cliffs.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:42]** And like a good team, you take out the first two beasts that are waiting for you as you landed, but not without injury as Boom sustains one step on the poison track from this creature.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** You still don't know what this creature is yet.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Maybe you'll find out.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Maybe you won't.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:58]** You all begin to explore, move down the ladder on this very scenic view, realizing what lies in wait.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** The facade of the offices.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:16]** There are three doors, two single doors, one in the middle, one on the west, and a double door that Miko, as you begin to explore up onto this patio that looks unused, brand new, fresh,

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:24]** you see that behind that semi-transparent, mostly opaque door, there's some light moving.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:36]** Boom, Cecil, and Kara have begun to move across the center of the map, taking, I'm going to guess, a wide look as Migo steps up onto this patio.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:44]** Archie has moved in and is floating behind you, keeping an eye.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:49]** I want to tell you guys, as a note...

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:55]** Once per combat, you guys can get a plus two to perception rolls.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:02]** We'll say once per ep and a plus two to attack rolls once per combat because of Archie's presence.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** Because I wanted to make it clear that Archie, even though I'm not always going to be each giving you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Yeah.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Or just per round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** I think it would make sense just like per combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:19]** One person can take a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** Will you manage this, Jon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Or you'll be like, okay, it's you that gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** No, I mean, if you all want to use it, I think that's fine.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:31]** I'm not going to choose when to give you guys that combat.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:37]** If you want to use that, then I think we can roleplay it as you call Archie over.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:44]** Or you communicate to Commander Bolt to have Archie come over and keep an eye, right?

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:56]** Or, depending on the perception check, if you say, I want a perception check on this door, maybe that would give you a plus to the perception check when you're trying to move up in a door, move around a corner, whatever it's going to be.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** As you guys are, boom, boom, boom, fast-paced, moving through.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** Again, Commander Bolt said...

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** This is important.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** You only have about an hour and a half before the sun sets.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** And those were the warning words from the IFF agent at the museum.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:17]** But at the same time, if you can get more information, the pattern here, things are starting to look similar now.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:25]** After several of these events that you all have, these kidnappings you all have been a part of, things are starting to look a little similar.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** Commander Bolt has made clear that they are trying to get some sort of schematics for the building as much as they can.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:39]** You get the sense that there is a team of people working to support you, as would be in any other case.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** They are trying to support you and get you information.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:48]** So there's probably a chance that as you're moving through, information will come through as they're able to get new info.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** With that... Understood.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** What do you all do?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** You're on the roof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:02]** Looking at this exterior, would it be reasonable for us to assume... I can't look at the map right now.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** I don't see the map.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** Would it be reasonable to assume that these...

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:29]** entrances are connected behind the facade that we can't see what do you mean connected like this door and the door down here and the door here is it connected to like one big area does does it appear from the outside like like a convention hall or like a large office space great question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** No, it seems like it is.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:34]** They're all probably different areas.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:39]** It's not a big convention hall because it's not necessarily a double height space.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** The building does go up from here.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** But in this one area, it's a single story height.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** And then you can see the rest of the building going up.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** And you know that some of the building goes down from here as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** We have nothing from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Schematics.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Not yet.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Yeah.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** So it's a Monty Hall problem.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** I don't know what that means, but sure.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** There's three doors.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** There's three doors.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:05]** Can we peek behind one door while we know that this door has somebody behind it?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:08]** There's some light playing behind it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** I don't know what it's from.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** There's some light behind this door.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** Should we go in guns blazing or try to sneak in?

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:22]** I'm always a fan of the more heavy-handed approach, but I'll check with you, TL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:28]** Yeah, you're the leader, but whatever happens there, we're trying to get Leora out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:35]** I'm always available to blow something out to make big entrance, but usually better is stealth against my nature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:40]** I think it makes sense, given the hostage situation, that we try to avoid...

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:56]** falling into a trap directly i think we should try to go around if there's movement behind that doorway perhaps perhaps one of these other doors might have less traffic you pick got a little chick one by one um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:02]** Migo is looking around for like motion sensors to see if he can approach the door without it opening on its own.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Give me a percent check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Okay.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** And Kara starts to move south towards the middle door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** Yeah.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:16]** I think Cecil is going to walk up to me like next to Migo and crack open some secret slime.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** Throw it onto the wall.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Nice.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** What does Secret Slime do?

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:25]** It's going to give a plus five to perception checks for any kind of openings or traps.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Ooh, I like it.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** You all should have Secret Slime.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:31]** The longer description is the slime kind of migrates.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** It was made for shipbuilding to find cracks.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:40]** So the Secret Slime will go and fill in voids and glow in order to reveal them.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** It helps you.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** That's super neat.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Love that.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Secret Slime is pretty neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:51]** You break open the slime and I imagine that you just put it right next to it and it just starts to move on.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** So...

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Give me that percent check and add five.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** So that's a 12.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Total?

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Yep.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** With the five?

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** Yep.

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** With the five?


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Okay.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** It looks like a door.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:11]** Looks like a door that is a sliding glass door that the seeker slime moves up the middle.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** It seems like it's going to open and slide.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** Both slide into like a pocket door kind of situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** Hey, I'm going to listen and see if I can hear anything.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** Miko steps up to him and presses his ear against it.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Okay, question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Yeah.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:34]** Is any of the surfaces of the building metal or crystalline?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Yeah.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Yeah.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:40]** There's metal, you know, chillers, pumps, futuristic HVAC.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:46]** I'm sure it's super heat efficient, especially given Mara's atmosphere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** So, yeah, it's all... So, like, towards this door where I'm at, I'm at the middle door.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:56]** Do I see any, like, metallic surfaces that I can...

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:02]** I can use one of my nanosite abilities, I guess.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:02]** Sure.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** Augmentations for an electro...

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:28]** location graft that's rad tell me more about that as you want to use it on the steel door uh silicon rugs are silicon based and i guess it's an rug feature that's been adapted uh can feel the presence of other creatures through conductive surfaces sensors installed in your hands or feet

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** can do the same.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:44]** When you're in contact with a crystalline or metallic surface, you can detect the presence of other creatures within 60 feet that are also in contact with the same surface, even though walls or other obstacles might be in the way.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** So, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Okay.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** So you would probably do it on maybe the floor, right?

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Yeah.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** If it were metal or crystalline.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** I mean, the floor is like a metal decking.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** It is outdoor.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:06]** So I don't know that you it's probably not going to be connected to the steel floor, the raised floor that is on the other side.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** This catwalk thing that I'm sipping on?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** Yeah, but the catwalk is a different floor.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:14]** Yeah, the catwalk is a different structure.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Non-metal?

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:20]** It's still metal, but it's not the same structure as what's going to be inside, right?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Okay.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** Yeah, so like...

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:27]** You could try it, but I'm just telling you that I don't want you to waste something.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:34]** So you would think like they would, you know, like this doesn't look like it's a slab that comes right out to the outside.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** It looks like it's a different thing.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Or not here.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Not here, right?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Yeah.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** Yeah.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** I just didn't want you to waste something because Kara is no chump.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** You've been around.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** You would know that, you know, outside you're like, actually, I'm going to wait and hold on this.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** That's rad as ****.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** You got to use it.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Migo.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:52]** Yeah.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** You put your ear up to the door.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** I do.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** You see the slime in front of you.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Still trying to search for all the little cracks.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:05]** And you do hear a voice coming through.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:06]** Muffled.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** But you hear like...

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:24]** Give me an intelligence or wisdom check, whichever one you think you're more skilled at.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** 14.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:29]** Okay.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:33]** So, you're pretty sure that that sounds like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:33 - 00:27:00]** Leora Huxley's voice so quietly into his comms Migo hey just listening here to this double door and I hear Leora Huxley on the other side I know we wanted to try to handle this stealthily but it sounds like our goal might be right here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** I'm coming to you.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Copy.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** I'm here with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** Does she sound like she's in danger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** She doesn't sound great.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Is the door unlocked?

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Can we get in?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** I haven't checked yet.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** I don't have the deft fingers that you guys got.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** I'll step back, create some space for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Boom.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** Are you going to blast it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** I will happily do so if we need to.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:30]** But if she's right on the other side of that door, it is not necessarily the right thing to do.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** How far away is she, do you think, Miko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** You don't know.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** It's tough to say.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** I don't know.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** It's tough to say.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** I don't recommend blowing it open, but I don't have anything super concentrated.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Everything's pretty, you know, big and boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** I mean, I could check the handle.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** I'll do it.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** I have a laser drill, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** I could help just a moment.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** I could perhaps get through the door with a laser drill, maybe.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:01]** I've never done it before, but why not?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** First time for everything.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Yeah.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** Normally, I prefer something with more to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** So what's your plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** Well, we want to see if this is openable.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** So we do a perception check on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** You want to see if it's locked?


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Yeah, locked.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:20]** Give me a computer check.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Computers.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** I could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** 30 computers.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** It's unlocked.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Excellent.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** It's unlocked, everyone.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** I have to say a little bit suspicious, but not what I would do leaving her right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Season's going to look at Kara just for confirmation.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** I'd like to go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Kara's going to give the nod.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:51]** And she's going to tighten up on her rifle just as that motion to open.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** Well, that was a 10 on stealth.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:02]** And he's going to crack it open and look inside.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Okay.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** As stealthily as possible.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Breeze in the first door.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:14]** Cecil presses the button or Kara gives the motion and I'm assuming Kara opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** I'll tell you guys what you see and then I'll show you.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:39]** As this door slides open and the secret slime falls to the floor, you see that the mature wood and friendly warm colors of this executive office sit comfortably next to traditional Akatonian armor and weaponry.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:55]** Various artifacts line a U-shaped counter behind a stoic black Thasseron desk, where four red chairs sit in front of the desk, inviting you all to sit, it feels like.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** On the left, you hear a soft bubbling.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Sorry, on the right.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** No, on the left, you hear a soft bubbling.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:12]** You think you see maybe a tank full of water filled with interesting sea creatures, including there's a sea snake with two heads.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** You can see it moving.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:19]** There's a small coffee table on your left with three casual seats.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** There's a door to the east.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:29]** And you see directly across from you a southern door that sits between two suits of armor.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:38]** As you open it, the golden hour cuts through the room, making the wood feel even warmer and more friendly.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:46]** And though her office is new, it feels like Leora Huxley could have spent hours here.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:52]** leaving her signature on the place in contrast to the cold, unused patio.

**[00:30:53 - 00:31:01]** And when you open it, you do see on the desk a very similar image of what you saw in the museum.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** Leora Huxley's upper torso, blue.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:13]** But instead of a full-size figure, you just see a smaller miniature of her finger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** Oh, I thought you were going to say she was like cut in half and spray painted blue.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** No, she's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** And as you as you step in.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** the words that Migo was hearing start to come through.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:36]** This past year, the hardworking contractors of Morrow built a state-of-the-art office that recycles 50% of our energy back into Morrow's power grid.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:45]** Now, before we get to the auction, I want to share the true reasons why we're here, the improvement of Morrow's citizens and their lives.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:49]** And as you know, we take care of our own on Akiton.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** Ringworks has made a commitment to the safety of its citizens.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** We are proud to be a new sponsor of the Stars team.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Hold for applause.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:16]** These four impressive individuals have made a huge impact this past year, including preventing a bombing at Abadar Corps, saving school children during the holiday parade, and most recently putting everything on the line to locate five kidnapped individuals and bring just as many to justice.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** Everyone, please give a round of applause to these fine agents.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Hold for applause.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:30]** We've already sponsored new technology for stars and look forward to developing predictive technologies to keep the sword of justice sharp.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:36]** With that, I thank you all for being here tonight and know every credit in this charity goes to a better Morrow tomorrow.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:41]** Hello, all good business leaders of Morrow government officials.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:45]** It is a recording and it's looping the speech that she was making.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:53 - 00:33:07]** give me a either maybe a physical science or I want to say maybe a it's not culture but like an engineering or computers check whatever you think is probably the easiest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Best for you.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** 19 from Kara, who can hear this.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Cecil has stepped in five feet.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** 18 out of 28.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** 28 computers.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Boom.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** 28 computers.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Okay.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Miko steps behind Cecil.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** And just to clarify, you said there was a door to the east?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Door to the west, sorry.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** Yeah, door.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** Okay.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:30]** Yeah, your east, map west, and a door to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:36]** So the room, this room is, I don't know, 100 feet wide?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Uh...

**[00:33:36 - 00:34:02]** squared ish it's like cut off uh diagonally in the corners 50 oh it's 50 okay uh 50 feet by 50 feet and then like a corner is kind of diagonal um and there's a big desk with four seats on one side and one seat on the other side and that's the desk that the recording is on uh-huh yeah the desk on the left the fast round desk oops i just might have opened it on accident there's a door to the south and then a door to the west


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** I think that door leads to a hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** You would know from your roles, everyone.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** You've seen these before.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:13]** They're high-end presentation devices.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** They measure the way that you're moving.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** They measure the way that you're speaking.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** They compare it to what is an ideal condition for the speech that you're working on.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:27]** And they will often give you a score at the end.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:30]** So this is something that Leora would use to practice with.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Yeah.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** What was the score?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:37]** Do you walk over and see what the recent score is?

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Yes.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Okay, Miko starts walking in the room.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** You look over at the score.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** It's a 99.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Out of 5,000.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Out of 5,000.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Out of 98.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Terrible speech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Yeah, horrible.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** What do y'all do?

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** All right.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** I guess the perception on the room.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I guess this recording is what I was seeing through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I see nothing again.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I'm rolling crap.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** Okay.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** I'm going to switch to my STF die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** A little shout out there.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** It's you?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Adam Reilly joins us.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Let's keep moving, guys.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** I love it.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:21]** The cool voice of reason as Kara is like, hey.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** They're all looking around.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** You're like, come on, let's go.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** Is this is there any else of interest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:32]** Would there be any signs of like where somebody may have last been?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:37]** Could we do like a survival check of some kind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Follow tricks.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Yeah.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Do a survival.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I don't know if I have survival.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:46]** I do.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** I have a plus four.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** And who did a perception check?

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** 24 on survival from Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:18]** okay 23 from cecil migo and boom did you do perception checks i didn't uh boom did a perception for 17 17 um i did not yet i think migo is looking around for any any indicators of the building like if there's like an office map or any like information there good question uh yeah 21 perception


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** No, you and Boom both, you don't see any maps.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:28]** You do see a lot of very cool artifacts behind the desk.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** You see the armor.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:34]** It's very meticulously housed in this glass station.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** There's nothing there indicating a map of any course.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Is it armor that we want?

**[00:36:39 - 00:37:04]** i'll just say here's here's one set for sure yeah here's yeah hey hey do you guys know anybody in the free uh the armor is please give it to here very very old yeah it's you would know that it's linked to like akiton's history during the gap maybe you've seen this stuff in a

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:29]** you can see laser blasts you can see where there's like uh you know cuts in it like this armor was used hundreds of years ago historic red black ornate gold techno archaic hybrid armor yeah and then cool artifacts behind uh the desk which you can look at but nothing that's a map maybe as you walk yeah go ahead oh no sorry i was gonna say is this a computer on this desk


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** On which desk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** The big desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:42]** Because I rolled a natural 20 for a total of 30 on computers if there's something that I could glean from it that could be useful.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** You don't find anything on this computer.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** That's a great roll.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:57]** This computer has barely been used except to connect to the video client to be used for this thing.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** It's barely been used.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:16]** maybe this is a real meta question if you do you think the characters know that they rolled well or they rolled badly they don't right so like boom doesn't know if he's actually well this is completely he's just confident right i mean high level


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** That's part of the DC for these things, right?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:37]** I mean, I'll just say like, you know, when you're running an adventure, especially for computers, there are things out there and you know of them as players and as characters, as PCs, that like there are things out there that exist that are meant to deceive you and are built into the DC of your roles.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:42]** So with that said, in some ways, you never know.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** If you actually hit it or not, depending on what's going on.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** But with a 30, you're confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** John casually picked up his cat, Beverly, and set her on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** And now I see the GM roll to Beverly.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** What's it say, Beverly?

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Tell us everything.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Okay, Beverly.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** She's not really a talker like Penny is.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Beverly, do I get something for the computer?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** She's just milking the tension.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** She is absolutely milking it.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** Kara, you are walking over to that door.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:15]** And with your survival, maybe you walked around because boom.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** No.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** Cecil, you also did a survival check.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** Seems like two things.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Survival tells you that one...

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:32]** It seems like maybe whoever entered and exited was not through the store.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:38]** And two, I think your survival would also tell you that.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:45]** Although everything is very warm and calm, things are on high alert.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** There's been some sort of like you're looking at the door.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** You're like, you know, boom.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** It's like there's nothing on the computer.

**[00:39:54 - 00:40:00]** It seems like there is some sort of alert status that has been raised in the building information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Right.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:05]** And we can tell that this door was unused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Yeah.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** Yeah, it seems like that door was probably not used.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** But this one might have been?

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** If you walk over there, it seems like that door is the one that's been used, yeah.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:21]** I think knowing that, you can tell that by the way that things were moved.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** There's like a grease smudge on this pad.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:28]** The way the chair was moved, the way like like a person moved.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** And you remember Leora looking to her left, which would have been south here.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:43]** And as the gun came in from that direction and you think the way that things are moved, maybe there's a handprint on this bottom right corner of the desk.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Right.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** Like you think, OK, they probably came this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:52]** And I think with that, Cecil, knowing that this room wasn't disturbed, is going to just clear it anyways.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** And so he's going to crack open the door.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** That door, as you start to walk through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** Benny, your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I'm not saying I'm walking through.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** I said open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:06]** As you take off your armor and call out loudly, I am here.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Hear me roar.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Benny, your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** Is it immediately obvious that this is the room that the TV broadcast was done from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:26]** You think about it, and although there wasn't a background, it was more of a hologram that was isolating and removing the background, like I imagine future video clients can do.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** It seems like it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:34]** Maybe the acoustics of this room give it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:42]** Maybe when you think about it, you're like, actually, the recording acoustics are different from the way that her voice actually sounded.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** It sounds like this was the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Cecil, you go to open the door.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** It's locked.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Pike up.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** You punch the door with your pike.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** It does nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Cecil, quit fooling around over there.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Let's get it.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Let's get this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:59]** We know where we're supposed to go.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:04]** And everyone's in the other corner being like, what are you doing, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** I'm just trying to push the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Let's stack up over here.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:18]** Cecil, is it open or are you... I pushed the button like 10 minutes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** I don't know if Cecil knows how to open doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Is it locked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** It's locked.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Are both of these locked?

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Ah, well, you know what I have?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Do you try to open the one to the south?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Yes.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** It's locked.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Everybody stand back.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** We can also go back the other way.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** There was other doors outside.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Why have we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** So keep in mind, yes, there are several ways you can do this.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:46]** Let's not forget, obviously, that you can also just use computers or engineering to open the door.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** Or you can blow it.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** It's up to you.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** It's all good.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** There are different ways to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Let's engineer it first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** Does nobody want to know what's behind this door?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** We didn't do this in the other game.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** In Threefold, we were so scared to do anything.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** I want to know what's behind this door.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Engineering check.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** All right, I will help with that.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Cecil acting on his own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** This is Kevin as well.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** We were supposed to breach this one.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** The door unlocks.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Do you open it, Cecil?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Yeah, I open it.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Okay.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** Cecil opens the door.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** Meanwhile, Boom is standing in front of the door to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** His explosives in hand as a tear rolls down his furry cheek.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** I just want to blow a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** Cecil steps out, looks down the hallway.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** He's going to step back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Okay.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:42]** You see an empty hallway, maybe about 40 feet long, a couple plants in the corner.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** Seems like it's a liminal space kind of hallway.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** There's a door right across from you and then a door to your left down the hall.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** This is probably a transitory space, like a transitional space.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:58]** People are not sticking in here unless they have a little side conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** And so Cecil will pop back in and say, like, all clear, but it looks like there might be a way down.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** There's a door to the outside and a door to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** I encourage inspecting it.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** This is very likely the way they went.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** I think this is the way they went.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Down south?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** This door in front of us.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Is there another door?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Yeah.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Okay.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** This door.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** That's locked.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Let's open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** I'm ready.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Let's do it.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Who gives an engineering check?

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:34]** Everyone, for the audio listener, everyone has moved their token at least five feet away from the door as soon as I said that.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Cara is not.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Cara is Stan.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** 25 Engineer.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** 25 Engineering.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** From across the room.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** The door.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** Yeah, why is Boom all the way across the room?

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** I don't know what door you're talking about, to be honest.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** I thought we already opened the southern door.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Cecil opened the western door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Alright, whatever.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** Joe, the game is currently paused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** I know I paused, but boom, boom wanted to go down there.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** So he's, he's at the South door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Okay.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** So boom was walking over to the South door.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Car is standing to the left.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Cecil is on the right.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Five feet away.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** Migo is directly maybe 10 feet behind the door.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Boom is five feet away from the door.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Necessity would have to be there.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Yeah.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** He'd have to be right up to it.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:23]** She's got her light rifle raised, raised and ready.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:29]** And Beverly is now making GM calls as she is changing the music.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:44]** here i'm not sure what she's gonna choose uh she's turned off this music and she is now playing i don't know what uh who is opening the door so i guess i will boom will open the door and then cecil will step in okay after you boom opens the door

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** And Cecil steps in.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** You guys want to open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Cecil falls down like a giant, like, you know.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** You guys want to open the door?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Keeping, like, chasm.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Cecil.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Sorry.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Yeah, he opened it.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** You open the door.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:05]** And you see a large conference room with eight chairs sitting in a circle around a warm yellow space.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** But more noticeably...

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:22]** Besides Beverly playing with one of my die, you see two large vests standing with their guns pointed at you wearing outfits that look exactly like the IFF outfits.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** And you need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:50]** thank you stf die for a total of two total of two you said initiative okay so let's see about this we got a four from me go we have a sorry a two oh sorry we have a 17 for me go

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Okay, wow.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Okay, wow.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Okay.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Migo is a 17.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** You have a plus 13 to your initiative?

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Yeah, that's wild, man.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** That's crazy.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** What about Kara?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Kara got a 14.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** 14, solid.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** What about Sisola?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** I got two.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Two.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Two is your total.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** Okay.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** And you're right in front.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** You're shocked.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** You're frozen.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** Amazing.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** What about Boom?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** 13.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** 13.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** 13 from Boom.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Let's see.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** I don't know.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** Love it, love it, love it.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Okay.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:38]** Cecil, I am going to need you to give me, what is your KAC?

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Sorry, EAC?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** 17, I think.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Yes, 17.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** Okay.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** And what's your KAC?

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** 17.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** 17.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** K. KAC.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:59]** As this rail gun shoots across the room in the first round, in a surprise round, as you open the door and step in.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:11]** And you are going to take nine piercing damage from this gun as this vest shoots you from across the room.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** Taking damage left and right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** Is that a lion gun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:24]** Yes, but I don't think it needs to be... It would also attack... Yeah, no, no, no.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** I don't think it's going to go through.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Let me check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** I thought real guns did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** They are automatic.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** But I'm not shooting in fully automatic mode.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** So you're good.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Good music selection, Beverly.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** Beverly killed it with this 8-bit battle music.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** She's a boss.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** She is a boss.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Cool.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Top of round one.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Let's start combat here.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** Migo7, what are you doing?

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:04]** You're standing way in the back, and you can see and hear this flare of light beyond in the conference room as it hits Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:10]** Migo is serious, but also a little bit jazzed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** He probably craves conflict more than is healthy.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** And so we ball.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Yeah.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** He storms in next to he's going to go in front of Cecil.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** Get a survey of the room.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:51]** love it push past everybody that's 30 feet uh i guess he'll use this as his last five this takes a sidestep to the right um and let's see let's see let's see let's see let's what's he gonna do you run you push past people you are excited for combat i'm sure um yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:51 - 00:50:19]** I'm looking if I can draw and fire a weapon at the same time you can draw as you're moving because you have a base attack so greater than plus one or plus one then he's going to draw his azimuth laser rifle and level it at the vest to the east the eastern vest everyone knows not to mess with the eastern vest sitting in the chair gun pointed at you but didn't fire sitting in the chair

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** He's sitting in the chair.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** He's Steven Seagal-ing this.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** He's sitting in the chair.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** Caught him a little off guard here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Too slow, bub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Is that what Migo says?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** He fires too slow.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** And it's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Oh!

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:35]** Nice!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:35 - 00:51:03]** amazing okay amazing all right let's get this critical hit deck is that 1d8 times two or is that 2d8 you roll twice you roll twice and yeah and add the bonuses both times you want to tell me to stop that one right there okay cool got it let's see love it 2d8 oh and you get 1d6 of burn god get out of here bro that's the critical yeah you choose that or the card uh all right i'm gonna go with the card


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Okay, it's a ranged hit, right?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Yes.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** So it's going to be, is it energy or kinetic?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Energy.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** It's energy.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Yeah.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** The target is stunned for one round.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Fortitude negates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** And that is 10 fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** 10 fire damage.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Wild.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** So Migo just like, he hears Remi get shot.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** He's like, man, this mouse is at some shitty day.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Runs in.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:43]** bowls over both mice steps to the left aims to the first target he sees which happens to be sitting in a chair and just like center of mass amazing just blows them back in the chair yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:50]** Okay, what's your key ability score there, Miko, for Evolutionists?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** I believe it is... Is it Wisdom?

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** It's not one of them.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Intelligence?

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** It's neither of those.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** I think his key ability score is Strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Strength?

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** What's your Strength score?

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** 17.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** 17.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:11]** DC 19 fortitude save in order to beat that stun doesn't beat it.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:17]** Sitting in the chair, run in, aim the azimuth laser rifle, boom!

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Just blow them back.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:30]** I definitely feel like the chair shakes a little bit as they are pushed into the back of the chair, leaves burn marks, takes 10 points of damage, and is stunned.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** Yeah.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** Way to knock them out.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Very, very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Okay.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Now they're flat-footed, too?

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Did I just see that pop up?

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** They're stunned.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** They're not flat-footed.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** They should not have been flat-footed.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Yeah.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** I didn't mean to do that.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:50]** I think it adds flat-footed when you add stunned, because part of stunned is being flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Okay.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** QQ cool.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** QQ cool.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Cool Zs.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Beverly just hit my light, so that was good.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** All right.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** Miko, you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** That's a whole turn.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Okay.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** You walk in.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** You say, too slow, bub.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** You blow them.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Hits a hole in their shoulder.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Amazing.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Kara, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Kara's going to pop into the room.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** If I can move.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:17]** Okay.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** And she's going to go... Kara pushes past.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** Yeah, she just sort of sneaks past and moves out.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:28]** Starts kind of slicing the pie in the room, so to speak.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Love it.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Love it.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Yeah.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Tactical.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** Goes in and takes a... This one here was the one that just got hit?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Who's the one that fired?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** The one that fired is the suburb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** This one?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Yeah.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Yeah.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** Okay, so she's going to...

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Target that vest.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Okay.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:53]** And with the light asphalt rifle that she had already raised.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** Nice.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** She walked into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Of course.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** Chest.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Like, fingers on the chest, ready to go.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Ready to fucking move in.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** That is an 18 to hit.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Ooh!

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** D. D. Yeah.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Kinetic or energy?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** It's the asphalt rifle, so I'm assuming kinetic.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Dude, 18.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Boom.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Hits him.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:21]** They can't follow you fast enough after hitting Cecil.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Love it.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Can't move fast enough.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** The range is 40 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Are you within 40 feet on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Yeah.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** It's not a big room.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Cool.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** What's your damage on that?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** I just rolled a 10.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** Yo, both of you.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** Both of you.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** 10 points of damage here.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** That's wild.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** No, she's all business.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** She's all business.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** She's got the rifle in her hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** She's a seasoned vet.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** That's how she is.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** She's done it before.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:28]** I like the picture of this being a well-orchestrated dance between Migo and Kara.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** Absolutely.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** Like, this is not the first time they've done this before together.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** It's my first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** It's the first time for me to think for Cecil.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Cecil, you had one or two years of this already.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Cecil fell.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:48]** Cecil opened the door, the other door, without saying anything and confirming.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** The story just writes itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** You clear rooms.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** You clear rooms.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Well, they've been operated.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** I'm just saying.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** It's good.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** He knew better.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** He knew it wasn't operated, so it was good to just open it and check it.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Clear.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Boom.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:10]** Boom, like, you know, like, sees the opportunity, sees how far away his teammates are from the Vesks in the room.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Yeah.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** And he sees there's multiple of them.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:19]** So he just leans back and he's like, it's time for Boom.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:31]** And then he throws a grenade, an incendiary grenade, into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** What square are you targeting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** You pick a corner.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** Sorry, which corner are you targeting?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** You pick a corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:44]** I'm picking a corner of this square because that will be safe for everyone else.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** What's the radius on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:54]** It adds 5 DC for every 5 or is it 10 feet range increment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:17]** uh yeah the range is 20 oh hold on no though so there's a there's a the throne dc here is better what is the radius of the explosion well no we're talking about the throw because you can only throw 20 feet and it's 25 feet away so it's going to add two to the to the ac of that corner yeah so it's seven now so don't fail or else it's going to randomly go in a different direction


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:38]** so i would just make sure he's throwing it if it's got a 20 foot uh diameter then or a radius then it means that he has to throw it at this corner in order not hit migo and just that's below the wall his name is boom though he's been holding back for a while he's gonna do this just saying so um i was just checking it's not a 30 foot radius because then it would hit all of us

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** That would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:43]** And Boom did check because he's a professional, so don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** He's a professional who laughed and said, it is time for Boom.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:57]** Now, the throat... If that's not the episode title, I don't know what it is.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Time for Boom.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** It's time for Boom.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:04]** It's time for Boom Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:07]** Not a double entendre.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:10]** No, it kind of is, especially given the intro we had today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:13]** What are you listening to as you throw boom?

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** That's what I want to know.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** What are you listening to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:22]** There is a song, because this is the only thing I could roll with, I guess.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:32]** There is a very bubbly, high-pitched song that goes, boom, boom, boom, I want you in my room, which actually tends to work out pretty well for this entire episode.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** I think it's by...

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** I don't know.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** It was my emo days, okay?

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** I can't remember.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** It's a 19 throw, so I'm guessing that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** You nailed the corner that you're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** Yeah.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** Well, it did go boom for one point of damage to both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:56]** So you throw the grenade, and it explodes.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:08]** the finger boys and it's a frag grenade or sorry it's an incendiary grenade incendiary grenade okay all right what's up and it does one point of damage to both of them

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** It does.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** Let me see if there's any cool extra things that happen.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Half for damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** What are the extra... Yeah.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** Do they get a reflex save?

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** All right.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** Just give me a second here.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:22]** Boom's a professional, so he knows the answers, which he will know because he already knows them.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Boom definitely knows.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:27]** Boom knows what they are.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** So, yeah.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** So...

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** It has a saving throw.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** Saving throw says plus two when unattended.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Yeah.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** It doesn't say anything.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** It just says saving throw plus two when attended.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** Reflex saving throw for half damage.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Yeah.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** For half damage.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Okay.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Yeah.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** That's what I thought.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** All right.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** And what's the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** One to one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Yeah, what would it be?

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** One.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** It would still be one.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** But I think it's always one.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** We don't have to do this math then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** Also, can your stunned guy take reflex saves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Oh.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Oh.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** So would he take the full one damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** I think he would take the full one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** He might take the full.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Yeah, it takes all.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** He takes all one damage.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:26]** I think part of the reason why it does one damage is because it hits that square and hits the base of the chair and starts to roll under the table when it goes off.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:35]** So parts of the table explode, dealing one damage to the vest in the chair and the vest standing up and the table starts to fall.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:41]** Fly up in the air and flip and turn upside down as you are destroying the new conference room.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** And that's our game.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Wild.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** I can't believe that you just end on a boom.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** You just threw this grenade.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:51]** Incredible.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** Incredible.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** Boom Alexa, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Thanks for bringing the boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:16]** thanks for bringing the boom it feels like a very stars moment cecil goes in boom gets hit then cara me go walk in boom throws a grenade that's like the standard entry for every room you know look at how good we are we everything except we're great at attacking everything else i don't know about but this we're good at this
