**[00:00:00 - 00:00:28]** Music Music


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:22]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast!

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** We'll Save the Podcast!

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** Episode Hot 105 coming in.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** We'll Save 105.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:36]** I am your deceitful GM, John Swan, here with my super cool, sweet crew who knows all these sweet shoutouts like Vinny just shouted out.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:40]** But that's not neither here nor there because today I have a question.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** We'll say 105.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** What kind of radio music would they play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Is this way in the morning?

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** Did you bring bars, John?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Yeah.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** I did.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** Let me just drop this.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** I did.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** I think the right answer to that, though, is it plays the album a week.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Come to our Discord.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Listen to the album a week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** That's what it is.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:21]** we'll save 105 yes is the album of the week yep yep that that will be our spotify or apple station which we are putting together for the last place 105 weeks maybe for yes yeah yeah i'm down i'm down i will uh i will make we'll save 105 that will play our album of the week here's my question

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:30]** If there was one conspiracy that you could just right now, you could know the truth of, what would it be?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** It could be classic.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** It could be like Bigfoot.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** It could be some government stuff.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** It could be like historical, like Roanoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Are you saying the Wilsey conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** Why are you going to bring up the threefold conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Because I would want to know the answer to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** Is that what you're talking about?

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** Is this the quickest manner we've ever had?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Wait, what is it?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Is the threefold conspiracy one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Well, there's at least there's four of us.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:59]** So if each of us, I only want to know the first fold and then you want to know the second fold.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** I'll figure out the third.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** And then Benny will know all.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:09]** I actually really want to know where Malaysian Air 343 went.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** The ocean?

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** Sure, but what happened?

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** Why?

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** Why did it disappear?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** How many years is it going to be before that's the plane from Manifest?

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** It just comes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** That's not really a spoiler.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** That happens like episode one, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** That's cool.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** That's the premise.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** That's the conceit of the show.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:37]** I did almost say that's the Plemys of the show.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I kind of like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** That's the plot premise.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** What is Plemys, Kelly?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** A Plemys is something that's indescribable.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:50]** It's like a plunger and a dildo and something else all rolled into one.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** No one quite knows what it is.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Is this a real thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** I think what you just said was a plumbus.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** No, a plumbus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Well, it could be.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** If it were manifested in physical form, it might be.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** But it's pink and it sticks out a bit and it's kind of gooey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Plumbus or plumbus?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Plumbus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I feel like that's just really efficient use of motion.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Because if you're already there, why not?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Plumbus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** He's making a Rick and Morty reference.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** Rick and Morty reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I don't know.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I've never seen Rick and Morty.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** I just thought you were being facetious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** I think that's the only episode of Rick and Morty I've ever seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** You gotta see the Meeseeks one.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** That's what you gotta see.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:34]** And then just imagine the most annoying person on the podcast as being each of the Meeseeks.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Oh, the Meeseeks, yeah.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** I'm not saying anyone's annoying here.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I'm just saying that could be me.

**[00:04:40 - 00:05:03]** every me seek is like what you're actually saying is we're all annoying in our own way which i mean i'm sure which is probably true yeah think about this there's someone out there listening to this show who loves every single one of us except one of us there's one of us that they absolutely hate if that's me if you're if i'm the one that you hate that one person that one percent or maybe ten percent of people who knows

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** Like, I just want to say I love you and I hope you have a good day and you at the same time.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Right.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** So because because we're all we're all sticking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:18]** I'm going to say that I hope it takes you an extra five minutes to find your car keys and you should join our coffee in our.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** our coffee-only, supporters-only Discord channel so you can tell us which one you hate the most.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** That's it.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Or send an anonymous email.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Exclude the person you don't like from it.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** And then like, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** Or just make a haters channel where we just hate on things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:43]** Well, and that's actually kind of funny because we, as Will Save the Cast, have a group chat that's without one of each of the members.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** That's true.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** We do.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** We have a Not John channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** It's literally called Not John, Not Kelly, Not Kevin, Not Will, and Not Vinny.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I've never seen that.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** I'm assuming Not Vinny.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** I don't see that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** But it's not for nefarious reasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** It's mostly for birthday gifts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** It's for birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** It's usually for coordinating birthdays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** It's the opposite.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** That's surprising.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:22]** just kidding i'm sure that we're all loved by yeah all of you and this is how we love you yeah yeah and this is how so the question is oh yeah conspiracy do is the conspiracy that you want to know who that person is and who they hate or is it something else uh i want oh who who are we talking about

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** The joke is passed.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:30]** What... What conspiracy do you want to know, Kelly?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** This is why we can't have this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:37]** I... You know, like, it's not...

**[00:06:37 - 00:07:05]** okay it's not really a single conspiracy i i do want to know so if you the universe likely if you're just dealing in probabilities has aliens somewhere right or intelligent as much as intelligent life somewhere i mean there's fermi paradox and other shit but there's a lot of reason to believe there might be i do want to know if they've just visited in some way in capacity because i don't believe the alien things that come up but i i wonder if maybe one of them would be true that would be really fascinating to me so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:08]** Have you heard of the dark forest hypothesis?

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Yes, I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** It's awesome.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Please laugh.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** I've never heard of this.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** I want to know now.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Don't make me Google it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:18]** It is the idea that there is other intelligent life out there.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** However, correct me if I'm wrong, people who already know.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:28]** But they are both silent and hostile.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:37]** And the idea is that as soon as you, in a dark forest where things are really quiet, as soon as a twig snaps, those large predators are going to come for you.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:47]** So if you try and make yourself known, you're actually inviting disaster from some advanced, you know, apex civilization to come to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:51]** Stephen Hawking believed, he warned, like, he's like, we shouldn't be sending signals into space, y'all.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Like, that was his view.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** Yeah, because we're like a...

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** bulldozer in a dark forest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:03]** I mean, the typical American presumption that we're the biggest and the baddest.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]** Anyway, that's a great conspiracy.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** Thanks for sharing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** Thanks.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** I hope that you can come and guest star on the show because that would really be a good thing.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** That would be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:20]** That would be a reveal to the world.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** We have a special guest.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** It's a live alien playing themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:45]** in the show what if they're just like yours though where they're so excited to interact with a new species yeah that's it they start touching us all over and stuff what if Sharon are real I would be I would love her that would be awesome shout out to Uldreon Uldreon in the discord and I would be very excited that's true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:49]** Will, Kev, you got any conspiracies you want to check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** I mean... Your Johnson 4?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I don't know.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** There's so many good ones that would be fun to uncover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:02]** I imagine, Will, you're a repository of plausible conspiracy theories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** I don't know what you mean, but...

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:10]** I'd like to know... Malaysian Air Alliance would be great.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** That's a good one.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** That's a good one.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:24]** Like you said, I feel like things are just... It's hard to investigate the other ones or to have first-hand knowledge of other conspiracies.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** It's just...

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** I don't know.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:31]** I'd like to know more about the Bermuda Triangle.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** I am so cynical that I don't know.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:42]** I feel like any conspiracy theory that exists is easily explained.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:51]** And when I say that, even when it comes to Jimmy Hoppa and how he just disappeared, he's probably just at the bottom of Lake Mead.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Conspiracy theories are just that simple.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** Where's D.B.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Cooper?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** He's the Black Dahlia killer.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Who is Jack the Ripper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Jack the Ripper was a guy named Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** So you'll just be disappointed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Royal family member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Yeah, that is a real thing.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Same thing with who was Shakespeare.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Maybe we should have started with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** Can we go ahead and... Oh, did you see the recent Jay Shakespeare uncovering?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** No, I haven't.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:31]** So I think at one point there was like a theory that Jay Shakespeare was Shakespeare's dad, but then it turns out it's like his younger sister.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** And some people are saying like she helped pen like certain things.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Like, I don't know.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Go Google it, man.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Jay Shakespeare.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** I'll Google it.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** Not right now, because we're going to play soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** At some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** I'm going to say it.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** I'm going to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:55]** I was just saying maybe we should define conspiracy theory, because I feel like that's a really loose term.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Let's say mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** Let's say mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:05]** I'm going to say, like, that's the one that everybody's thinking is Epstein and everything related to Epstein.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** That is a conspiracy I would like to be finalized and just, like, over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** You say that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:21]** Have you seen the footage of, like, where they took Bigfoot's footage and they just, like, they stabilized the camera?

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** It just looks like a dude really tired, like, walking to bed.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** Yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** It clearly looks like a human in a suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:51]** i want to know roanoke i i really want to know what happened to the colony of roanoke so there was just they just disappeared right they just totally disappeared this has happened with ships too so roanoke the only reason i know this is because my my street name is roanoke that's that's the street on the phone so you're the descendant don't don't disappear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Right.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** No, Roanoke was an island off of the Carolinas.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** And it was during the 1600s, I believe.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** And there was a settlement there, pilgrims.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** But there was also Native Americans, I believe, that lived there.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** And then they had a civilization.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Colony.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** And then somebody left and came back.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** And when they came back, everybody was just gone.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:17]** There was no bodies, no signs of anything.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** There was just an unexplained disappearance of people.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:27]** But the truth is, something probably scared them off, and they sailed back to the main island.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** And then died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** And sunk.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Probably.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** Yeah, but what happened to Sir Walter Raleigh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Who's Sir Walter Raleigh?

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Isn't Pocahontas too, isn't he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Isn't he the guy that marries Pocahontas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** I thought he disappeared.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** No, that's John Smith.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** No, no, no.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** She dates someone new.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Hold on.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Let me find out.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** She dates someone new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** You know what mystery I want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** Pocahontas is for the streets.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:54]** Well, for the Londons, I mean, it's a different hemisphere.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** I don't know what she was thinking, but like, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's about Sir Walter Raleigh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Wow.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Pocahontas too?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Pocahontas too.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** Mystery conspiracy solved.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** Didn't know.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** What I want to know right now...

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** is what happens at the end of the Nanadventure.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** That's the mystery that I want to figure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** I'm okay with skipping that one.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Well, I just want to figure out why What's-Her-Name betrayed us.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** That would be useful.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Okay.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Well, let's talk about it.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** What's-Her-Name?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Who?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** Leora?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Or Lua?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Or Suxley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Colonel Bolt?

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:27]** Kevin could be right that, like, Archie is a traitor.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** Really.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** I mean, like, Archie could be a traitor.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Look at all these people they've betrayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** You just can't trust anybody in this entire game.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I don't even trust the four of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** You shouldn't.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Good.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Good.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:44]** You all fought against the IFF agents last time who were trying to capture you and drag you into the gate.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:52]** And also you fought that steamy, smoky, that sounds a little too sexy, that smoky canine creature.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Yeah, hellhounds.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** That appeared.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** Not a hellhound, but you all have to figure out what it was.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** It was a heavenhound.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** It was a heavenhound.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** That was teleporting and attacking Cecil a bunch.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Also, Meagle.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** Meagle.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I can't say it worse today.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Meagle.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Meagle.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Yeah.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Leora Huxley went invisible.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Has not been seen.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:19]** Kind of unclear what is happening there.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:27]** Then, right as, I believe it was Kara who deals this killing blow on the strange esoteric beast.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yes, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** I would like to lodge a formal complaint as a Wilson cast member.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:48]** I logged into the Discord today, into the Spoiler Alerts channel, and there was a whole lot of text grayed out and a whole conversation about Leora going invisible that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Wait, don't spoil it.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** I didn't read any of that.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** I didn't read this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** I, as a cast member, really wanted to read.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** And it's just sitting there for me to read it.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:59]** And I can't read it because I don't want to spoil your story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** We're going to say nothing.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** That's all it is.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:05]** Okay, 75% of it is, oh, just how are you today?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** I'm good.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Because I was like, I'm not going to read any of this.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** And they're like, good.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** And started just making their own private conversation behind the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** All the way off.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** about everything that's happening in the mechanics.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** I'm like, ooh, I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** There's nothing in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** It's all been approved by our rules lawyers.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** That's the conspiracy I want to know.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** That's the conspiracy.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Okay, sure.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:34]** All right, so she did that TBD on people knowing what she did.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** And then you killed, Kara killed this strange esoteric beast.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:44]** And then there's this bright flash of white light.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:54]** Both, I believe, Will, you had said from the shot and also from the explosion, like the creature itself evaporating, going back.

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:13]** to whence it came or wherever it goes next and then as miko is about to be like all right take a deep breath what's going on we got this one vest left i don't know where lura is the yosuke that was getting that was on the platform just went and just like fell over the side right then

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:25]** Lieutenant Lua and 10 Morrow Strike Force team members show up, and she says, Leora Huxley, you've wasted everyone's time, and it is not a better tomorrow because of you.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:29]** Your experiment has come to an end.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:33]** Stars team, either get the fuck in that gate or die.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** I don't really fucking care.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** Ah.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** We had so much history together.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** Good time.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** You did.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** You did.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Many happy hours.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Many trivias.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Many secrets confided.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** You know, just is what it is.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Let's go back to the gate.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Let's go back to the gate.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** I'm going to bring back this music.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:02]** And I want to say that set a scene kind of for the listeners because we are still in...

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Encounter mode.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:09]** Kara is closest to the gate, but really you're at the bridge that's heading from the platform to the gate.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** Cecil and Miko are caught up in the middle right in front of this little platform in the center.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:21]** And next to the Vesk IFF agent, Boom and Archie are up on the small platform where the draw gate control is located.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:27]** Lua and her Maro special forces agents, strike force agents, are up.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** They came out of a small side door and they are lined up.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:36]** weapons, armed, aimed at you, ready to go.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** And I'm excited to see what happens.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** And Kevin, of course, has his hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** Do I get an attack of opportunity on Lua?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** No, she didn't do anything.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** She just walked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:50]** She entered my area of which I'm threatening and made a threatening comment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** And made a threatening comment.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:57]** I forgot that threatening comments trigger attack opportunities.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:02]** You can assume that she took a five-foot step.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** She's not going to do that.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** She's going to find the garden step to get closer.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** She's like, hey, hey, hey.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Don't do it.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Don't do it.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** She's like, hold on.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** I have to say something to introduce myself.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** But make sure...

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:38]** i'm just letting you know i'm gonna kill you but i'm just but but she's like on her tippy toes like right like right at the edge be like don't do it don't do it all right where did leora go again sorry we don't know is this a she just disappeared yeah she just disappeared you saw her go invisible somehow there after getting hit but whatever yeah it's cool no it's cool again all above board remember that cecil got hit by something

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** I think it was last round because we are in round four.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** I believe round three.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Cecil got hit by something.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** And with that, Migo, it's your turn.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** I'm going to unpause.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** What are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** We're in the middle of round four.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:55]** I feel like Migo is excited just because I am excited.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** Stacked up baddies is what Migo has been waiting for.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** Oh, do you have a line weapon?

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** He doesn't.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** I kind of wish he did, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Take out five guys at once.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** Before this happens, I have something to say.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:16]** I need Cara and Miko to roll perception checks.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** To what?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** Roll a perception check.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Actually, you know what?

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** I'll have everybody roll a perception check.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** All four of you roll a perception check.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** I got a 21.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** 21 from Cara.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** That's not terrible.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** 16.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** 21 with a plus 9.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** It could have been a lot better.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Or sorry, plus 7.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Kev has this many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** Kev has 7.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Cecil has 7.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** And Kelly, what did Boom get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** I got a 23.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** Wow.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** Okay.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Yeah.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:55]** You notice that the smoke from that creature, that again, that creature was in the fog that Migo coolly put out.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:02]** But it came from an area over towards the door where you were.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** And it seems like it's not going away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** The square that you pinged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Yeah, which is where it came out of.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Yeah, across that thing.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** It seems like it's not going away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** What's not going away?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** It's not going away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:23]** No, there was like a smoky, weird substance that it emerged from, and it's not going away.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** Miko, what do you want to do?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** Oh, how threatening are these agents?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** You know them to be one step, essentially, below where you are.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:42]** You come in to do these special operations when they can't always... When either regular officers or strike force officers can't...

**[00:20:42 - 00:21:02]** do it but they are like these are the people that the next stars group or any other stars group would probably be the first pool that they're going to pull from so they're pretty good right so that like that's the caliber like their demeanor they're trained just like you are cool uh them cool he goes gonna move right up to the line


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:26]** yo bro i mean he's called the hammock all right look let's bang let's bang spanking bang as they say so there's two columns of five and the racks of light which like hurts my heart to do this um there's a rack slight at the top of the left column oh they don't get an aoo because they have not acted in this combat yet in this round


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Well, actually, they did.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** Their turn was coming up and doing this and taking that.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** So, actually, I think they do get an AOL for a second.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** That's a cheap move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:37]** You won't give me an attack of opportunity, but you're going to give her one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** Because Migo now moved afterwards.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** So, because I move into a threatened square...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:45]** Yeah, he's moving into a threatened square to attack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** But you had to move past her, right?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** No.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:56]** You had to move... I could have very easily gone from here to here, which would have been the right tactical move.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** And that's what I assume Migo would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** Aren't you still moving into a threatened square, though?

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:02]** No.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** It's leaving the threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** The threatened square, not moving into.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** Let me grab my core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:15]** Because in that case, then technically Lua also would not have triggered because she was moving into a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** That's fair.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Yeah, it's leaving a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Let us find out!

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** First thing that happens this week.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:34]** When you threaten a space and the opponent moves or is moved out of that space in any way other than a guarded step.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:40]** Okay, then just let it be known that you can't move into a threatened square and trigger an AOL.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:46]** You have to move from a threatened square or from one to... That was probably known from a while ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** 170 episodes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Well, you know, we are not always good at remembering, so I'm just saying that.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** That's true.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Okay, all right.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Kelly, you got that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** Kelly, where does the attack of opportunity come from?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** I was reading another rule, so that's why I wasn't listening to this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:33]** go what do you want to do let's keep going uh he's gonna wield the hammer and start playing whack-a-mole on these wannabe stars agents okay wait wait they they might not be there they're just like us man i don't know what you're waiting for she said get in or die i'm not dying without a fight yeah but she said he swings the hammer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Oh, on who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Lua or the one that's right in front of you?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** The agent to myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** The top of the right stack.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** He has cleave, so he's just going to hit all of them.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** That's the plan.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** He's been complaining that he couldn't get this in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** I had a mini heart attack.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** I thought it was a one because of how the paint was scraped off of my die.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** It's a four on the die.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Plus seven.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** So, 11?

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Doesn't hit.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** 11 doesn't hit.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** You step up and swing against KC.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:11]** He swings at, like, head level because he wants to be showy, and then this agent, because they're so well-trained, is just like...

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** And it's back.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** It passes across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Yeah.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Headbutts the person behind him, unfortunately.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** It's ready.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** Like, Migo's ready for battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** To stand in back.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Okay, love it.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:23]** Let's go.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** It is the Vesk agents.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** You were leaving that Vesk agent's threatened square.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** I'm just realizing that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:35]** That's true, but that Vesk agent hasn't acted in this combat yet.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** That's not true.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** They have acted in this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** Yeah, combat didn't stop when they entered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** Yeah, that was their turn.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:46]** I thought it was like Stop Combat, New Encounter.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** No.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Got it.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** Then yes, that Vesca agent would get an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:55]** They do get an AOL, and that is going to be a...

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Ooh, that's a 22.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** Is that it?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** That hurts.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Okay, see?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Yes, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Thing is, do you stop?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** Unless there's an ability that stops me, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** When you get hit with an AoO, do you stop moving?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** No, you don't stop moving.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** It's just spells.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** It's four points of damage.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** We might lose Migo in this battle.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** Maybe you are right up against 10 people.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** That's his lot in life.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Let's ball.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** He's at 18 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** 18 hit points.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Alrighty.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** That's awesome.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Wait, no, it's not awesome.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** You said he's at 18 hit points?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Yeah.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** And now it's their turn.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** And now it is their turn.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** They are going to take a guarded step and they're going to attack Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** They can attack if opportunity, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** They take a guarded... Oh, he said a guarded step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** I missed the guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Why would there be an AOA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:57]** Because... I've reached, Migo.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** So he threatens 10 feet instead of 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:06]** But he moved into the... If you leave a threatened square... Yeah, he left the 10-foot one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** He's threatening the 3-point line, not the free throw line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** But he 5-foot stepped it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** That's a crit against you, Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** I'm ignoring you.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I'm going to not take the card, and I'm going to do the damage.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** I'm down.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** I'm sure.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** It's 14 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Not quite, but I'm close.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** I'm all out of stamina, and my hit points are at 11.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** I'm all out of stamina, and my hit points are at something low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Okay.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Wow.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** You said 12 points.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:41]** Stars team are fading into that good night.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** 14.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** Nah, we're not going to let this happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** Only because John brought in 11 people in the middle of a fight.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** He's like, your nanites will go into that gate one way or another.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:56]** Either you walking in or you're throwing your dead bodies in.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** That sounds like me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Just classic.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Just going to overkill TPK.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** All right.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** So they take a step forward.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:03]** Rage.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** Rage against the dying light.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** Do not go quietly into that dark night.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Boom, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** What are you not doing quietly right now?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:16]** Well, I mean, Boom is not one to be quiet, at least in terms of what he does.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:21]** So Boom is trying to rush back as quickly as possible to get in range.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** So he moves.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** His movement is 30 feet, I believe.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:32]** So he runs to... Who is this pink surrounded thing next to Cecil?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** That's the best soldier.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** That mob is still around, right?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:41]** That's the one that just hit me and... Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** All right, give me a second.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:46]** All right, so Cecil is... No, I mean Boom is going to come over here.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:50]** If I go here, then that's not enough space.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Actually, no, never mind.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:54 - 00:28:16]** yeah uh i feel really dumb okay all right so i think he's gonna end up doing this instead so yeah this sounds like more reasonable uh boom is gonna move um over here part way and then he's gonna like take out his gun he's gonna keep his so you run down the steps and sidestep over to get a clean life he looks at archie a little bit suspiciously i what's on archie's turn yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:22]** There are 10 people standing in close proximity to each other, and you throw grenades.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** You're literally surrounded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** I know, but I can't get there in enough time, so I figured I'd do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** You can throw a grenade.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Throw the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** I don't have the range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Yes, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** You'll take a penalty today, Sid.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** It's a DC-5.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** It'll go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** You can throw a grenade 500 feet.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:44]** If you miss, you may hit your compatriots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** I did not know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** You are currently... It is time for boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** You are 40 feet away.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:56]** You're 40 feet away from the nearest one that might hit Migo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:04]** Boom has always been planning for it to be time for boom, but I was not aware that you could throw that far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:08]** For every extra increment, it's a minus 2 or plus 2, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:17]** Boom is going to attempt to throw a grenade at the corner of probably here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** So how much are we talking about?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:23]** Wait, what is the range of your grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** What is the radius of the explosion?

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Because Migo is right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** I think it's 5.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** F*** me.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:51]** i accidentally closed something um it should be it should be i don't know it doesn't say so just give me a second uh the splash i'm not sure so i don't know if it uh i think it actually says on the so i'm going back i don't know which i accidentally closed but i'm looking at the sticky bomb thing i don't see anything about that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Oh, it's just a sticky bomb?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Okay.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** No offense.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** I didn't mean that.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** It's just going to entangle them all, but that's great.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** But Mego can also be entangled if you throw it close enough to him.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** I mean, it still does explosion damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Yeah, it damages.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** It does.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** It also entangles.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Whatever.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** All right.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Look, you're getting boom.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** You don't get to choose what kind of boom you get necessarily, okay?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Like, he threw a lot of booms before.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** All right?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:23]** It's not full, an endless cornucopia of, like, your specific kind of grenade you want at any given moment, people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** You just wasted all the grenades on the desks.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** All right.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Everyone's being so mean, all right?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** I'm still getting used to this, like, the rules thing, so just be nice.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** I'm still getting used to playing by the rules.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** All right, all right, shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** All right, so here we go.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** I love it when we put the social media crew so early in the app.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** I know.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** We're, like, halfway through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:52]** So Boom is just chilling out over here, ignoring the guffaws of his teammates.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:56]** The press is also laughing at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** The press is also laughing at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** All right.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:06]** So he's going to throw a grenade, and he's going to throw it not near f***ing... Chuck it all the way to the back.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** It's our answer.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Way over here.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Where?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** So...

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:15]** I'm not sure, like, what the chances, how it's worth, you know what I mean?

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Like, losing, like, your accuracy.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** What's the grenade?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:22]** It's a sticky bomb grenade, which I can talk about in a second with the rules section that I now do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:26]** Okay, what's just, yeah, just what is the range of 20 feet?

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** 20 feet.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:32]** The explosion, it's a Mark 1?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** It's a Mark 1, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:38]** Okay, so it's going to explode, and they'll be entangled for 2D4 rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Yes, I know this.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** I wanted to say it only because I wanted people to know that I know it.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Okay.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** All right, all right, cool.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:50]** So as you were saying, John, let's cut that out, and then let's just say that I said it, which is it's 2D4 rounds.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** I'll tee you up, Tangled.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Yeah.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Okay.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** Oh, it does say 10 feet.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:00]** I think the entanglement... The radius is 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:07]** Unless you want to entangle Migo, you have to hit a square that is... It's nowhere near Migo, so it's going to be in here.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** I see on the map where your thing is.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** That's about 50 feet.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** That's going to be...

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** That's AC 5 for 20 feet, AC 7 for 40 feet.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** Anything beyond 40 is another 2, so that's going to be AC 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:25]** Can I just clarify, when did we say it adds to AC as opposed to subtracts?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Because the ranged increment penalty is a minus 2.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** That is the rule.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Yeah, for thrown.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Is it thrown?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:58]** all right well also kevin likes to go back and forth and just with the i'm trying to get the text myself so i can understand it because i know i know so the reduction in my what's my basically uh my my negate to accuracy or whatever i can't like you don't worry about it on your end it's been added on the it's on the ac to hit that corner and now it's a nine corner boom roll to 15 cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** You roll the 15 on the die.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** All right.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** So then you hit that thing.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** And that explodes.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Love it.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Sticky Bomb Grenades flies up.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** They all get Reflect Saving Throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Yeah.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** Okay.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** That is what I don't know.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I don't know what they have to pass for that.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** I couldn't find it anywhere.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** I was reading, and now I don't know.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** The question is, what damage do they take?

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** What damage do they take?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** That's what I'm trying to do at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Oh, I think it's just them being entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** I thought that it said there was... Oh, my God.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** All right.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Yeah.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** There you go.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** That's what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Okay.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Fantastic.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Yeah.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:41]** And we talked about how they get a saving throw because this was similar to the other sticky bomb grenade that was used in the library, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** So what's that DC?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** It says 2D4.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** For literally everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** So I'm going to be doing it right now.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** So that's a 2D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** No, 2D4 is for the duration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** The DC should be 10 plus half the grenade's level plus your dexterity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** It's 2D4 rounds.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:17]** right what's your dexterity my dexterity yeah uh all right half your dex modifier kev 13 so plus one half grenades level plus your dex plus your dex modifier modifier modifier yeah so plus one and this is a mark one so it's a dc12

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Okay.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** Let's see.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** That's going to be a lot of people.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** I think that's going to be... Is that all of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** The range is 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** Except for the first two that are right in front of Migo and Lua.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** I think that's the back four.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** The two rows are back four, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Yeah, I accidentally moved, but yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** I think so.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:51]** okay this one this one failed up here it's gonna take me a minute to go through they're entangled the one right uh second line left failed okay

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:56]** This one, the one second, the one third in line on the right failed.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** So that's two of them failed.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** And that is it.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** So two of them got hit with the sticky bomb.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** They are totally stuck in place.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** It got in their socks.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Their socks are wet.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Sucks.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** How many rounds are they entangled for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** It's 2d4, so I need to roll that.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** 2d4.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** And while you're doing that, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:22]** So range penalty is a minus 2 to the attack roll, not a plus 2 to the AC.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** I'm not seeing where it says plus the AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** Plus 2 to the AC is for shooting weapons, so maybe it's different for a throwing weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** No, the penalty is the same for either.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** I'm not sure where the plus 8 to the AC is coming from.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Then maybe that was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** It's a minus 2 to your attack.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** God, I'm looking at Pathfinder, baby.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:46]** The other thing it says is that for most ranged weapons, a maximum range of 10 increments.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** And then for thrown weapons, a maximum increment of 5.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** So you can take the penalties up to 5.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:57]** So a DC of 15 is the farthest you can throw to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:22]** okay five yeah anyways that's all i'm saying but yes it should be minus two to attack thank you not not plus what a plus and a minus plus the ac and a minus to the well the bonus is kind of like equivalent it's just generally speaking yes but with grenades it's specific because any penalty to the attack ac also applies to the spell save dc so the minus two to the attack also applies to the dc for entanglement

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Why is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** Oh, any penalty?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Okay, I see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Okay.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** Well, they both rolled out.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Okay.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** That actually means that none of them would have been entangled.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Oh, man.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Rules, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** Rules.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** I was reading up on this.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** What's the TLDR of why they are not entangled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** Because you had a minus two to your attack roll.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** You also had a minus two to your DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** It was too far.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** You were too far.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Oh, wow.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** You mean the original concern that I had was an actual concern?

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** The original concern that you had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Oh, I had no idea.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** All right, good.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** That's good to know.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** That wasn't your concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** That was my concern.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** No, it really was.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** The hill that Kelly died on was perfectly valid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:08]** Well, it turned out, it somehow turned out that way, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** That was it.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** You can rewind.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** That is exactly what I said.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:15]** That's why he was going to go the other direction and shoot on his way to get there so he could get closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** In 105 episodes, Kelly found a valid hill to die on before Kevin did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Okay, now hold on a second.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** I thought you were going to say tactics or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Good tactics sometimes.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** But yes, this is my hill.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** I'm dying on this explosive hill.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** Kelly, do you... Look, I'll be completely honest.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** That didn't work out well.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** It's okay.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Cool.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Didn't work out.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:41]** But there is a white, sticky, viscous liquid on the floor now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** Maybe the stretch or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** It was just the wrong grenade.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Don't start.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Don't start, okay?

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** I didn't know what kind of stuff you guys do.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:56]** You just take a Mark III and it would up the DC.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** And that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Oops, that was the wrong container.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:02]** I gave you two lightning guys and a bunch of other things.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** You did a great job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** You did a good job.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** Sorry.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** All right, Boom.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** Well done.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** I'm sorry it didn't work out.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Sometimes this is how it is.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** But good attempt.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** You're playing Boom.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** You're playing Boom, and that's what matters.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Cecil, what do you want to do on your turn?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** You're almost dead.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** A lot's going on.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** A lot's going on right now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Yeah, what do I want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** I'm going to die.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** I'm just going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** That's probably not advice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** I'm kind of hoping it happens now.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** But yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:43]** Cecil's going to take a guarded step to be closer to Migo.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Okay.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** And as he does that, he's going to stab back.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** He's going to almost do like a stabbing motion as he jumps backwards.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Stab and retreat.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Yeah.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:02]** And...

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** He's going to slice, actually.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** This is going to be non-lethal because I'm done with this shit.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** He's going to slice.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Okay.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** So let me shake this up.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Shake it, shake it, shake it.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** AOL, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** No, because he took a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** That's going to hit for 24.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** I'm pretty sure 24 hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Way to just assume they're AC.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Yeah.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** How much damage did you do?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Oh, I dropped my...

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** He dropped a leg as high.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** Four on the die for 11 points of damage.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Plus seven.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Okay, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** That's lethal damage.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** So 11 points of lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Wow, very unlike you.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** 212.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** Should just get real.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:47]** They stabilized themselves on that platform because they are nearly dead.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:50]** There's blood, vast blood pooling beneath their feet.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** You can see them slipping a little bit trying to hold balance.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** They are... They are...

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** pretty much demoralized and about to die.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** You brought them to the lowest level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** In my mind's eye, Cecil licked his thumb and did the eyebrow thing.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** And then just... Take that!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:17]** I think as soon as he lands behind Migo, though, he's going to look Lua in the eye and just say, like, what kind of game is this?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** And that's my turn.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Okay.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** It's Archie's turn.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** Wait, so can we just get on the record that Vesca's surrendered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** No, they're not surrendered.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:30]** They're at very low HP, and they're not happy.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** They're very demoralized.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:40]** Look, I'm just trying to say I don't know what they're going to do yet, but they don't seem like they're too happy to attack right now at the moment.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** So I didn't say that they surrendered.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** It's a very specific word.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:53]** Archie...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** Is this when Archie reveals his true colors?

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** God, Archie, I knew it.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Halo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Halo.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** He's going to betray us.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** He's going to betray us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** He's just like the guilty spark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:43]** for those listening john is very clearly having like an internal conflict of like how would archie respond is is this the moment when archie like i can't reveal or or is this like does he maintain the good question this is the good question this is the the conflict playing on john's face this i'm making that assumption but i've known you for a little while the mustache doesn't lie


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** My mustache clearly moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** Unlike Archie, your mustache does not lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Yeah, I know what Archie does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:56]** Archie moves... Yep, go ahead.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** You're going to move up to one of us and self-detonate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** No.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:13]** Archie moves five feet, lowers down to the console, a cable comes out, and they start making some sort of something in the computer.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Archie picks up where the Yusogi left off.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:22]** They are still looking at what you're doing.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** They're still capturing that.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** All right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** That was round four.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Let's get into round five.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** I'm so angry right now.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Good.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** Use it.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** It's round five.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** I need the top round five.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Roll a betrayal check.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:48]** Your classic betrayal check.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:55]** I need Cecil to give me... I need you to give me a reflex saving throw.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** F*** me.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Three.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** What'd you get?

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** Total.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:12]** You step over, stab, give Lua the evil eye, and say, what kind of game is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** John, did you just measure the distance to the gate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:22]** Yes, he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:26]** I did that knowing that you can't hide it on Foundry.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:29]** Cecil.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** I want to say Kara and Boom probably see this.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:40]** Cecil, it's like in Dragon Ball Z where their bodies become lines and they move super quickly.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:45]** Cecil, your body literally starts to arc up in the air.

**[00:43:45 - 00:44:00]** and then appears at the base of the plat- like, right up the steps of the platform, right near the glazing that separates you from the geothermal abyss below that you can walk on, don't worry.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:05]** But you are now 60 feet closer to the gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:09]** Um... F***.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** That's- that's Leora's doing.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Um, I'm- okay, so I was teleported, is what you're saying.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Like, I was-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** There's something that happened.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** All will be revealed in plot armor, I imagine.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** Possibly.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Yeah, I don't know why I said that.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** I'm literally shaking as I'm trying to type this.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** John, I hate you.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** We'll see what happens next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** We'll see what happens next.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:40]** Because there's a reason I had you guys roll perception check.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:49]** I think Lua is about to respond to you, Cecil.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** She's about to respond.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** Her hand is up.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:59]** She's about to say that this is a game that you don't lose.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:10]** And her hand is up, and she is about to, it's clear to all of you, she's about to give the order, come her turn, to have them move in and attack you.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:15]** And her hands are up, about to issue that command.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** And then she stops.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:30]** As all of you feel this... This... Silence.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** You can say something.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** You can hear yourself breathing.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:40]** But there's a cool wind coming from the area where that smoke was building.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:49]** There's a static in the air that starts to build into this cloud.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:55]** And you can see like before where the canine creature came out of this right angle that was like colored.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:00]** It's like the light bars that have like an RGB flow that go up and down.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:05]** That happens as if along a seam and the darkness follows behind it.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** In a straight line.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** First 5 feet up.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** And then 10 feet up.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** And then 15 feet up above the ground.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** And through the darkness.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Steps.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** A massive.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Otherworldly paw.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** Followed.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** By tentacles.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:36]** that lead to a massive snout as this huge canine aberration steps into the material plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:43]** Huge as in... Mechanically huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Oh, wow.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** It is quite big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** Unfortunately, it's right on top of him.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Get it away.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** It didn't step there.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** It's fine.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** It's okay.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** That was a mistake.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** As that happens...

**[00:46:52 - 00:47:21]** all the electronics around you start to like like things like it's like a whole shock went through the system and it's recalibrating you see that there are sparks that start to fly out of Archie and fly out of the console the gate actually for the second just shuts down and that aura that was pulling you in is removed let me remove it here on foundry and

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:34]** And then at the very last second, you hear... And the gate comes back online and it is overloading.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** There is electricity arcing all around it.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** The systems around you are unstable.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:47]** And there is a crazy creature that just came in to the chat.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** Let me show you the artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** Wait, so did Archie shut it down and then it just came back up?

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Or is Archie doing something more?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** What the fuck's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Is this Delta Green?

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:07]** This thing is 15 feet tall and you can describe it as a dark souls enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:11]** It has like a face with like two or three tongues coming out of it.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:15]** It's all... It's like a chupacabra.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** The face is like full of holes and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** Which is the conspiracy that I would also like to know though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Thank you.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** It was a crazy old man that was eating goats.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Its belly is opened.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:33]** It's a weird dinosaur horse demon thing with tentacles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** It's like its entire body is also an orifice for devouring things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:44]** I think the split lower maw is also like... Maw, that's the word for it.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Maw.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** Maw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** That's what her kids call her.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** It's a ma.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** That's what her kids say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Yeah.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** It's like a demonic canine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:06]** You are able to roll a mysticism check on your turn to try and see what see what this might be or give you any more information about it.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:10]** Here's the thing, though.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Here's the thing.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:15]** There's a tongue that I think Kara sees.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Maybe Cecil, you see.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:24]** Because the gate goes dark and then you look back at this glowing source of purple light that's around it.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:27]** This barbed tongue...

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:34]** Flies out and Miko, you see that Lua... I don't like that Jon's cursor is on Miko right now.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:43]** And you see that Lua is about to say something and the tongue wraps around her face and entire body.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:53]** And you see it start to constrict and her body starts to wilt as if diminishing in power as she's dealt 50 points of damage.

**[00:49:53 - 00:50:05]** And then the tongue squeezes as if wringing a towel and carelessly throws her body off the platform as she has died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I'm screaming right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** That was its turn.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** Yeah, I don't think we win this fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** I think this thing's going to save us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Everyone give me a perception check.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Nineteen.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Nineteen.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Nicely done, Kara.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Seven again.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Seven again.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:35]** Cecil's fluster from being flown through.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Boom.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Fourteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:42]** Migo is shook from the wilted Raxalite that just got yeeted off the platform.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** You got a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Nine.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Kara and boom.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Your pros.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** Even in this face of sheer adversity, the options are clear.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:03]** With that power fluctuation, two things have started to occur that are significant to you.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:09]** One is that the gate, the draws gate that the stewards built, is now overloading.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:16]** And the lights around it that signaled when it locked into a location...

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:25]** are turning, like, I think I said orange, as if they're locking on a location, and then will lock on.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:37]** So in the space of three to six seconds, they will lock on, and it seems like they're locking onto a location, and then searching, and then locking on again, and then searching, and then locking on again.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** And remember,

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:44]** The boom found that there are three different locations that this gate is locking onto.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:50]** So in its overloaded state, it is spinning from location to location.

**[00:51:51 - 00:52:03]** Additionally, the door out of the chamber as a fail safe measure has started to move and is starting to close pretty slowly.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:07]** And that's the one that you all came in that is to the east.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:31]** that's what you notice and car it's your turn what do you do uh while seeing all that car is gonna try and i guess run past this monster and get the f out okay like is there anything to solve here just get out alive right easy for you to say i mean your team lead they give the order


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** What do you do?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Cecil is close to the gate.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Boom is really close to the door.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** You're in between.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** Migo's in between.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:44]** This thing lashed out 20 feet away with a barbed tongue.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** I guess it was 15.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** But, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** Yeah.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** So we think what?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** We have to fight this thing?

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Yeah.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Okay.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** I'm not... Sure.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Car's going to take a full attack.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** I wasn't saying that.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Yeah, no.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** I...

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:06]** I don't have any options, and Kara is at a loss as to what's going on.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:12]** I guess maybe we should do a mysticism check to see what this creature is.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:21]** Maybe there's a quick way to... Maybe there's a weakness in this giant maw-like creature, which I didn't roll too bad.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I got a 20.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** 20 total?

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** 20 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** I'll tell you this.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** You're not quite sure what this creature is.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:34]** It is absolutely related to the canine that you were fighting earlier.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** And you're certain now.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:41]** There's something in the back of your mind when you saw that creature that you didn't think about what it could be.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:47]** And then now that you see this creature, you think that was absolutely a hound of Tindalos that we fought earlier.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:51]** These creatures that chase anybody who defies...

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** the natural order of time or the drift.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** That's what the Hound of Tindalos does.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:04]** And you've heard of bigger creatures who have wrecked starships and cities.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Is Tindalos a god?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** I'm...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** Tindalos is an interesting name that we'll get into in the plot armor.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** But the Hound of Tindalos is a sweet creature.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** And that's what the other creature was.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** This is probably related to it.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:28]** And I will tell you that as a pro, I don't know if you are that... You're like, yeah, I can take it down.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:31]** But you're actually like, I don't know if I can take it down.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** You could fight it.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** You could try and get by it.

**[00:54:36 - 00:55:02]** hoping that it doesn't take uh attack or opportunity on you and try and get out maybe it's gonna move it clearly attacked lua or do you take your chances with the gate the chances with the gate that's still the same gate that would like kill us allegedly again remember it was locked into a certain location yeah that clearly leora wanted you to go to

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** Who knows about Lua?

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** But now it's going to two other locations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Okay.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:16]** So this one's coming out of, like, one location, and then the other one is the Stargate-looking thing, and the third one is where again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Well, there's the idea.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** Look, I'm just... There's a third location.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** That's all I'm asking.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** You all will make...

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:26]** Well, there's one location that Leora wants you to go.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** The other two locations that it's locking onto, you're not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** Okay, but where is it physically located, the third gate, the third opening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** There's no opening.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** It's one gate.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:42]** Every round, it is moving into a different location.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** All right, and then who...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** Who did he wipe out again or whatever?

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Lua, right?

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Kara, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Yeah, he took out... Okay, okay.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** It took out Lua.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** All right, my bad, Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** It's fine.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** I think Kara would be, like, shocked.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:08]** Just completely, like, broken down in shock.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:14]** And she would probably, like, see this beast and take...

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:26]** some movement back towards the gate towards Cecil, um, and fire off with the, um, her philosopher's thing that she's already got out.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** Nice.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** At, at the creature.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Yeah.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Okay.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** Just as a side note, I asked a question in chat, please answer when you get a sec.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Uh, okay.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:42]** So you're, you moved back like 20, 25 feet towards the gate.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** You moved back pretty far, uh,

**[00:56:44 - 00:57:04]** yeah yeah okay and tactfully saying all right i'm gonna i'm gonna take a shot okay i think as as soon as you take that shot cecil is gonna just like whisper to you almost cara i'm i'm scared


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** He's always scared, though, you know.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:11]** It's nothing new, but... I'm just saying, you always are.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** You're literally scared before a drop.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** I mean, I don't know.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** I rolled a 22.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** You roll a 22.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** You fire the shot.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:30]** It goes right through the creature, missing it, right through the smoke and hits the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Well, that...

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** Looks like that shot's going nowhere.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** I don't know about us either.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:45]** I ain't much for having hope in this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** That is good to know, Kara.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** I will not shoot him.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** Kara, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Who's doing the perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:56]** You, Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** I got a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** You notice...

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:17]** You don't need too much to know that at your feet as you're about to climb up onto the platform where the gate is, there was a... What is it called?

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:27]** There was an explosive that must have been flown off of Lua's body that landed near that platform.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** There it is.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** Okay.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** Okay.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** It is what was Lieutenant Lewis' turn.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** And now it's the Morrow Strike Force.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** And they did not sign up for this.

**[00:58:40 - 00:59:04]** four in the back turn and start banging at the door i'm gonna just uh i'm gonna give them the um let's call it pinned just for the moment they're not actually pinned but they are like pushing against the door absolutely trying to get back in that door was shut and now is not opening at all possibly as part of a failsafe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:07]** Maybe the sticky bomb stuff got stuck in it.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** You know what I mean?

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Maybe.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:17]** The six in front start shooting at this creature.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:22]** I believe, Migo, you will get an attack for opportunity on either one of the first two.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** They are not concerned about you at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Get one in before you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** He's a spiteful motherfucker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Yeah, he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** You don't get my flanking bonus anymore.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** That's a natural 20.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** It doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** That's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** Which one were you attacking?

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** I kind of don't like this for Migo's character, but I do like it because I think it's true to him.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** The one directly south of him.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** The one that he missed when he moved in.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:59]** I'm going to go with the deck, if that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** You're going to go with the deck?

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:05]** I think the arc would just be redundant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** How much damage do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:10]** I do 26 plus 7.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** You double the dice rolls.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** You double both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** You double both?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** Here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Yeah.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:20]** You reroll twice and you have bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** One.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** Tell him to stop.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Okay.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** All right.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** It's a melee.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Was this slashing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** No, it's electric.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** It's electric.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]** Your attack ignores energy resistance, but not immunity.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Intense.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** That's f***ing useless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Yeah.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Your normal critical is arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Yeah, it's arc.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** 1d6.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Would the arc also be dealt?

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** No, I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** No, because that's the critical.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** But the arc attacks multiple people, doesn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** It arcs to a second creature.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** That would have been cool.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** But it's just like 1d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Yeah, but... That's fine.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** It's all right.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** So which creature does it arc to, and how much damage to this other one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:12]** Okay, so it's going to do 18 electric to the one immediately south of me.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Uh-huh.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:17]** And one damage to the one to its left.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Okay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Nice.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:25]** So it just, like, lands firmly in the middle of the chest piece, and then just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:48]** yeah shocks all all around the one that is directly in front of you dies done yeah yeah probably for the best for them yep wow and the one next to him gets a little jolt okay just a warning okay

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Migo, it's your turn.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:59]** Please note, none of their attacks hit the creature when they shot.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** What do you want to do on your turn, Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:10]** Migo says, he hops on the comms and says, Stars team, it's been a pleasure.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Get the fuck out of here.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** He takes a guarded step.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** That's a measuring tape.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** I'm going to take a guarded step to here.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** Which is where for the listener?

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Five feet to the north.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** I'm going to take a normal step to the right.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** Do a little dance.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** Make a little get down tonight.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:41]** I'm going to provoke that attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** No.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:55]** Look at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** F*** you, video.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** F*** you, John.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** You could have made me cry, man.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** This is intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** See you next week.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** Maybe.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** See you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:07]** Maybe.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Maybe.
