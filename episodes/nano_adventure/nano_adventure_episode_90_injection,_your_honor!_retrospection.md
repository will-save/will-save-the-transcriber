**[00:00:24 - 00:00:25]** Well, I talked to you at the end of last year.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:28]** I said thank you for being awesome and fantastic.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:29]** Hope you were taking a break.

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:31]** And I hope that break was taken.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:37]** I just wanted to grab a super quick minute before the episode to say thank you.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:48]** Because at the end of last year, we dropped our coffee, we dropped our merch store, and I want to give a big thank you to our supporters and to everyone who's supported and bought cool, cool merch.

**[00:00:49 - 00:00:50]** We really appreciate it.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:20]** I love that all you waved and none of our audio listeners knew.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** That was great.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** We're still on audio.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** It was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I hate the holidays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** That kind of thing.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:07]** As it stands right now, I'm going to be traveling a lot over the next couple months, I believe.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** So I'm going to be doing some remote episodes.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** Where has yet to be determined.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** But I'll be buying tickets soon.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:40]** been a busy year for me i'm really happy that it's over because i have some other responsibilities that i'm wrapping up now and i'm happy to be able to spend more time with will save i'm so glad you have no idea you're very glad can this be a geoguessr game where you just leave little clues of like where you are yeah all right we could do something like that yeah yeah maybe in the background i'll leave like some random like a will save sticker or like uh you know yeah

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** Like, a skyscraper will have, like, the We'll Save logo.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:47]** Like, I paid, like, seven million dong to, like, show that on, like, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:52]** I thought you were just going to drop a fact about your location each week on the show.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:58]** I didn't realize you were going to go to the extent of billboards and paying for advertising across the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:03]** Yeah, paying corrupt politicians in fertile countries to do weird shit for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:08]** You know how, like, in Rockefeller on New Year's, they just, like, dump confetti from the roofs?

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:15]** It's just Kelly dumping Will Save stickers from whatever skyscraper you can get access to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:20]** Or dumping a bunch of the dice towers that Will has.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:25]** I don't know how this would help anyone figure out where it is, but it'll be fun to do just for the walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** What about anyone else?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** I haven't really thought ahead to next year.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Okay, we'll do it now.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** I know.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** I just want to survive it.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** Yeah, I'm in retrospect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** That's the goals for 2024.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** Survive it, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:57]** We talked about New Year's resolutions and what we wanted to focus on this year in an episode past.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I have no idea what mine were.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** Mine was saying no to things, and I have just failed tragically at that.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:09]** So I'm tired.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** I'm going to start saying no to things and I'm going to be happy about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** So you're saying that the willing could ask you for outrageous requests and you would fulfill them?

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Is that what we're hearing?

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** I'm saying they could have done that.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** They could have done that, but now.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Oh, come on.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** You failed the last year, are you sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** This ship is sealed.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** It's gone.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** It's gone.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** Send me your outrageous requests to help me practice my no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:40]** You can send outrageous requests on our Discord by going to discord.willslakepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:45]** Yeah, and then do at Vinny Rodriguez or whatever he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:50]** If they're legendary enough, we'll convince Vinny to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Yeah, we will.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** He'll be down.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I'll let you guys be my Greek chorus.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** Tell me whether or not I should do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Give me the facts.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** Well, also props to you for remembering what you said last year.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah, I don't have a clue what I said.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** I don't know what I said.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** I don't know.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** I got so much going on.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Does the passage of time affect you?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:49]** I mean, the longer that I stay temporarily linked to this time, it's only when I'm asleep or non-temporally linked to our timeline.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** That's when I don't age.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** But yeah, or they're like clear.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** It's kind of weird.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** I thought you said more than that.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** I have my job and you guys and my family.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** I want all of you to thrive.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Kelly, I appreciate you looking out.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** You know, it's good.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Do you see this?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** What is that, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:32]** yeah yeah what's that everyone at home uh if you're not sure just on audio screw you now we'll describe all right so it's it's a mug that has will save the podcast our beautiful like pyramid of giza status like background with the stars yes and then on the other side it says coffee coming soon to an internet browser near you slash mobile phone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** It doesn't say that, but it should say that whole phrase.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** It should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:40]** It says coffee, and it has a little heart, and it's KO-FI.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:44]** Because we're developing our coffee, which will be released at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** Hopefully very soon.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Or it's already out.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:54]** At that point, maybe you can go get one of those mugs for whichever your dominant hand is.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** It's fine.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** There'll be some little surprises for you on coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:01]** Dan, this is real convenient because I'm going to stop advertising for Dr. Pepper and pour it into my mug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:06]** We can't do that, though, because then we'll lose our DRP sponsorship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** I really want to get some of that.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:19]** If you have some Flaming Hot Dr. Pepper, if you are a Dr. Pepper reward member, I really want somebody to send us a Flaming Hot Dr. Pepper.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** And make Kevin drink it so we can video it and put it on our social media.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** What address can they send it to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** If soda is the flaming hot, I will do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** I will try it.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** That's got TikTok written all over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** It does.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** I really want that flaming.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** I want to try it myself as well, but I really want Kevin to try it.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** Should we?

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** Not for any selfish or comedic reasons whatsoever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** It's actually part of the meditation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** That's what you picture.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** If we can get our hands on that, I will do it.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** I will drink it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** You're manifesting Dr. Pepper into Kevin's hands.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Yeah, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:02]** But then I'm going to document everything that happens to my body for the next 24 hours after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** You survived worse, man.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** You are a real-life cyborg at this point.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** That's true.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** He has metal in his face.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** He has everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:16]** I've been watching a lot of, like, Naked and Afraid, and that's all I could picture when you said, I'm going to document everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** It's just you and a handheld camcorder out in the wilds of Maryland.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Just totally naked.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** But, like, your home is right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** You're trying to sleep outside.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** I'll mess with you.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** I won't mess with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** That's how we get Benny to do something.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** It's because Kevin is chaotic evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Kevin Chaos Monkey Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:03]** I've been around Texas.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** Benny, make sure you don't fuck with Texas, and he's going to say no.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Or he'll say, I'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** All right, let's get started.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Let's play.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** I am very excited.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:22]** Because we got a little something special for y'all today.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Let's start with a recap, as we do.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Last episode.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:49]** We wrapped with these questions from the stewards as you all are in day one, let's call it, of your time at Tercala Space, sitting down with Dr. Nodens and Silverton, answering some questions in the morning.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:56]** Here's, you went through, asked all the questions, you didn't provide any blood.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** Dr. Okay, great conversation with Dr. Nodens.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** Really just a pleasant time.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Good time.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Also didn't provide any blood.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:15]** Silverton's asking for Rick, the final interview here.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** A little debrief.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** And you all are like, hey, hold up, hold up.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** We got some things to talk about.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** And through some

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** let's say, disagreeing voices.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:40]** Some of you are ready to jump on this feeling in the back of your head that something is not right.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** And some of you are like, you know what?

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** It's probably fine.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:47]** But Rick says, I trust the stewards.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** I'm going to go.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** You all are trying your best to get a chaperone.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** And the stewards have said, nope, we're not going to do it.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** So clever you all

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** You're like, hey, why don't we have Bernice go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** It's fine.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** It's really fine.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Come on now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** So you go back behind the door.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:15]** Rick and Bernice enter into the medical chambers.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** And we'll move on the map over to Kala's base.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Because it's at this time that

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:32]** Rick is in the room with Silverton and Dr. Nodens.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:45]** Silverton, Rick, has gone ahead and started doing their physical exam on you.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:56]** And I want to highlight something here, because in the background, Dr. O'K, your chemilizer, bing, bing, bing, bing,

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** Do you remember what it said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:14]** I believe it said that our android friend has some nanosites that are in his blood as well as some Yosuke DNA.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** That is.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** Peculiar.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** Nonetheless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Peculiar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Nonetheless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:26]** So let's cut back to Rick and Silverton.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:33]** Dr. Nodes is... I just add so much crap to my OneNote.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** He's typing away.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:48]** Silverton is hitting on your knee, shining a light in your ear, checking out some vitals, maybe hooking you up, trying to pull some data out.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Just connects to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Yeah, just download everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Oh, darn, your USB-C.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Let me get an adapter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:59]** By now, USB-C is pretty... That's true, that's true.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** It's probably like, yeah.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** Or is this USB-Z?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Right, or is it like a mini USB in 2023?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Amazing.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** Rick, what are you thinking?

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:21]** You are the last of your crew to be walking into this.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** You've been prepped.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** You've been told about all their experiences.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Bernice is there with you.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** How are you feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** I think overall, Rick feels very comfortable.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** Like I said, over and over again, he trusts the stewards.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** He has no reason not to.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:41]** He's a little offset by being in a hospital room, but he understands that.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:47]** But there is this sense of concern that the others have.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** And he hasn't forgotten that.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:59]** And so as much as he is comfortable and trusts the situation, I think he is trying to be observant and trying to understand that.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:23]** what dr okay and and colin were telling him and warning about here's here's said the same but he didn't feel as confident that there was something going on yeah so yeah rick rick is just kind of keeping an eye out for anything that's off okay i roll a perception for that sure give me a perception yes i think it's gonna tell me anything but i'm gonna try perceptions of plus seven


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** 14 total.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** The middling rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** You never know what's going to give you.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:40]** I imagine that your consciousness is focused on what's around you.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** You're a little on alert.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:51]** Some part of you is still thinking about the fact that you couldn't reach the android abolitionist front.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Yeah, that's on the back of my mind for sure.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** And as you start thinking about that,

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:06]** You look over and I feel like the floor with its yellow circular ring, it just starts to reflect a lot of light.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:11]** It's almost like you can hear the glare coming off the cold of the room.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:18]** Silverton reaches over and, excuse me, just kind of brings your eye back up.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:24]** You just need to look in your... Starts to move the flashlight over your eyes and

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** And there's something about the way that the light comes into your face.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** You almost feel it.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** There's a warmth.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** There's a white flash.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:45]** And you forget that you are in dear callous space.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:49]** I want you guys, if you would like to, I invite you to close your eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** My heart is pounding right now.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** I don't know what to think of any of this.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** All right.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** My eyes are closed.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** Because our listeners can't see if our eyes are closed or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** The white fades away.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:16]** And we're looking at an emotionless white tile floor reflecting the cold lights recessed in the ceiling above.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** The camera pans up.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** We start to see a...

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:29]** Rather long, large hallway with four sterile medical bays along it.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:40]** Just barely make out four long metal apathetic tables equally and deliberately placed in the center of each bay.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:52]** Scores of uncaring instruments lay in glass cabinets and on small podiums, ready to speak, ready to work.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:01]** Next to each table eagerly stands this long, pliable rod with flexible connections at either end.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:06]** And it's just stuck in the floor and sticking straight up right next to the table.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:14]** As we listen, we start to hear the faintest, unusual sound.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** And I encourage you to open your eyes and check out what we have here on Foundry.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** We hear the sound...

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:52]** of laughter friendship growing louder and louder until the only door at the end of the hallway opens and who walks in but at the front a kitsune fox species dressed in a crisp white lab coat followed by a helki an android

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:57]** and two Yosokis all dressed in patient garb.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:08]** And behind all of you walks in this young Yosoki female dressed in, sorry, kitsune.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Thank you.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Uh,

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:36]** dressed in sharp officer dress and wearing the the collected demeanor of leadership as she walks in three yosuke nurses sorry four walk in and then quietly shut the door you all walk down the hallway you're looking around you can see as the

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:59]** yusuke officer walks up to the front of the of the group standing next to the kitsune and as she strolls by she's looking at each of you and then turns and as she turns you see the label fresh newly applied to the uniform

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:10]** It's four stars and the letters S-T-A-R-S patched, bio-weaved into a coat.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:15]** The kitsune speaks up first.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:20]** So, please, let's see, take a seat on your table.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:25]** You look like you are all dressed accordingly here.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:34]** And then she starts to walk each of you to a bay where she would like you to sit down on the table.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** Will, as...

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:45]** One of the Yosuke nurses is walking you to the furthest table from the room, the furthest bay.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** Who do we see walking there, and what are they thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** Are we speaking about a Hilki by the name of Kara Valtar?

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** I believe we are.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Yeah, well, we see a...

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:10]** You know, average height, human, female, deep red skin, as common with a Hilkie.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:17]** She's dressed in some pretty snazzy Defrax hide armor.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** She's got...

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:40]** you know, some like breaching charges and some, uh, different, um, some equipment for basically like, uh, she's kind of dressed like she looks like, uh, like almost like a beat cop, but a little bit more, um, I don't know, like grungier.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:46]** She's like covered in, she's got a little bit of, uh, red dirt on, on her clothing.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** And she's, uh,

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:54]** She's kind of eager for whatever's about to go down.

**[00:24:54 - 00:25:04]** She's a little nervous, but she trusts that it's probably part of her advancing in law enforcement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** Nice.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** I like that.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:12]** Fresh, literally off the street, off the beat, come right in.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:20]** One of the Yosuke nurses takes some patient clothes and just lays them on the table for you to change into.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:25]** And then gives you kind of a nice, reassuring smile.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Thank you.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** And walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** I'll be right back.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Okay?

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:38]** and then slides the glass, and the glass frosts, allowing you some privacy to change.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:46]** Kelly, a Yusuke nurse is walking you to the second medical bay.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** Who do we see, and what are they thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Am I in uniform at this point, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** You are in whatever you would like to be in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:01]** Well, you see a Yosuke clattering along the floor.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** You hear this clause go click, click, click, click as he goes down the hallway.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:10]** You see, like, the trail of cigar smoke just, like, in the camera view.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** You don't see him yet.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** And then you pan down.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** You pan to the right, and you see it sticking out of the fuzzy little mall.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** And boom, walks down the hallway.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** He takes out his cigar, puts it out on the floor.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** He has no respect for this place.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** But he has respect for his job.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:37]** And he is off of an assignment where he helped disarm some explosives.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Very successfully, as he always has done.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** And he gives a light wink at the Ahsoka nurse.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:49]** All right, where do you want me, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** If you could just go ahead and put your stuff over on that chair there.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** And here are the clothes.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Put some down on the table.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** And I'll give you a little privacy.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** Is there anything else that you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** That's all right.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:01]** Thank you.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** I will call you if need.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** You see like on the floor clatter a bunch of grenades and other like wires and things like this.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Super loud.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** a huge gun that's like the size of his body.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** He like puts on the floor and he puts on these clothes.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** And, uh, but the cigar is still in his mouth.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:53]** There's a knock on each of your windows just to confirm that you're ready.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:58]** And a display appears in the corner.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** You didn't see it there before.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** It looks like a projection.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** And you see the kitsune's face.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:12]** There's a brief pause and then a warm smile on their red and white face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** I am Dr. Fevrox.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:22]** And I will be overseeing your final injections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:37]** today i have to say you have taken an incredible and i know at times difficult journey and i just have to commend you all on your constitutions

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:52]** The acceptance of nanocytes into a living body is not always easy and can sometimes be fraught with issues.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** But the four of you have been exemplary.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** So thank you.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Now, I do have to warn you.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:07]** Today's is the most... Today's injection will be the highest quantity.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** And it could be a little distressing to your system.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Do not worry.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** We are here.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** You have your own personal nurse.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** I will be here.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** And you have the entire ability of the facility here.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** So you will be in good hands.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** She pauses.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:28]** kind of giving you each time to let that sink in.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Any thoughts that anyone wants to share?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Kara takes a deep breath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:41]** Miko, I mean, he's stone-faced.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** This isn't anything more intense than he's seen before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:50]** Now, a word from somebody that you know very well.

**[00:31:52 - 00:32:05]** Dr. Fedrock's leaves the screen, and then the camera points down a little bit, and a Yusoki, the sharply dressed Yusoki with the stars patch, walks in.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:14]** There's a smile on her face, and she says, I'll begin by saying that I am proud of each and every one of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:22]** The steps that you have taken will lead us to a safer tomorrow and a better

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:31]** So as your Commander Bolt, and also as your friend Bolt, I am here for you.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:36]** Don't forget, I know I've had conversations with each of you about this process.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:42]** I know that you're well aware, but if you have any other questions, let me know now or afterwards.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** I am here for you.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:49]** Your families and your friends, whoever you have requested to be here, are just outside.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** I will be with them, and we'll all be waiting there.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Whenever it's over.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Okay?

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:04]** When you see Commander Bolt and you hear this, they have been the link for you.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:13]** They were your first contact for you as you decided to investigate and join the S.T.A.R.S.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** group.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:29]** So their words feel, or hopefully, as she hopes, should feel reassuring at being a familiar voice before you take your final step to being a member of the newly minted stars group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Have you defined stars yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** What does this acronym mean?

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** I have not defined stars yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Is that intentional?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Is that intentional?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** All things are intentional, John.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** No, it is not.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Never mind.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** It is Special Tactics and Raid Squadron.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** We'll get more into what that means in just a minute.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Dr. Fedrox walks back.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:56]** You see her body into the camera, zooms up as the AI corrects it.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** She nods immediately.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:06]** And the four of you feel the cold as now no one is in the room.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:17]** until the door opens and the Soki nurses walk in ready, immediately carrying tools and medical implements, laying them down.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** And then one hand is on your shoulder, gently asking each of you to lie down.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:34]** There's a cold sensation as part of your patient's gown is lifted on your right or left side, whichever you've indicated.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:42]** as they begin to apply this antiseptic, their hands are quick and efficient, but gentle.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:56]** After a few minutes of some sterilization and waiting for the antiseptic to numb, they walk over and your mind is thinking of other things.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:04]** You don't think that there's anything happening until you look over and you see that

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:11]** your skin is cut one inch, two inches, three inches.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** There's no pain.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:20]** You don't feel anything until you hear the... of the hose bending around your head.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:29]** And if you can stomach it, seeing it slide into the three-inch aperture in the side of your body.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** And then it feels real.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:43]** As you feel the pressure and the odd sensation of a foreign object pushing into your body against what you think must be bone or an organ.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:51]** And there's a quick as both sides of the cut are sutured quickly to allow the hose to stay in.

**[00:35:51 - 00:36:00]** And there's the reality of the situation hits you as you begin to feel a warmth.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** And the nurse says,

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:10]** Officer Valtara, do you consent to receive nanobots for the purpose of serving the STARS unit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Yes.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:16]** Officer Boom, do you consent to receiving nanobots for the purpose of serving the STARS unit?

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Bah.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:26]** Officer Remy, do you consent to receive nanobots for the purpose of serving the STARS unit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** I think he takes just half a second too long.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** And then he says, I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:45]** Officer Miko, do you consent to receive nanobots for the purpose of serving the S.T.A.R.S.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** unit?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Miko puts his hands behind his head and leans way back.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:10]** There's a sound as there's a motor far away unleashing nanobots, and there's a feeling of the tube starting to shake as you can see the nanobots come down the tube, and there's a whooshing sound.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:20]** sound that slowly grows louder until it begins to resonate in your body as that warm sensation becomes a little hot.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:27]** It feels like part of you is starting to dissolve and get stronger at the same time.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:34]** I need each of you to give me a fortitude roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Well, damn, John, we started with rolls early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:41]** We are starting with the rolls early.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Yes, we are.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** 24.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** It's a natural 20 for a 27.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Natural 20 for a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** It's a 13.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:58]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** 24.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Okay.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I love when the dice tell the story.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** I really do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Kara.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** It's Kara, not Kara, right?

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** It's Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Yeah, Kara Voltara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Kara Voltara.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** Loves it.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Love it.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Love it.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Kara.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:28]** For a second, it feels like that heat will overtake you and you very easily, maybe through some meditation, are able to focus your mind and keep with it.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** And you are just focusing on the sounds around you.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Boom.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** Similarly, you are able to push through that pain.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:40]** Migo, this is nothing.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** You've already put your arms back.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** They don't leave behind your head.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** There's pain, but you've been in more intense burning pain for longer.

**[00:38:49 - 00:39:02]** And Remy, Officer Remy Cecil, the white of the room overtakes your senses as the feeling of heat.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Of course, it's Kev.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:13]** Can't stand the heat as this feeling overtakes you and you pass out.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Oh my god.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:23]** And we see the words, We'll save the mini-venture come right across the screen.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:28]** Followed by, One year later.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** We open up onto...

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:46]** The beautiful, ornate sites of the Akaton Museum of History.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** John.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** I'm going to pause you.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** No one has vision in Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** No!

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** No!

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:20]** I will take this moment before we start there to say welcome to you four and to our listeners to We'll Save the Mini Venture, a homebrew, I don't want to call it one shot, I don't want to call it a one book story, it's a lot less than that, but it's going to be a wonderful, good time telling, well, you'll see.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Very interesting story indeed.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:25]** Welcome to the mini-venture.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:25]** Mini-venture.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Welcome to the mini-venture.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Hopefully it won't take a year.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Hopefully it won't take 52 episodes.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** John wrote this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:41]** This is all John's creation, by the way, so I think he has the ability to cut us short from going on forever and ever and ever and ever.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Congrats, John.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Thanks.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:53]** Let's jump back to it as we got this nice ambiance going in the background of some people talking and some music.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** And let's come back as I bring my one note back up.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:04]** Let's come back to the sound of laughter and music filling your ears.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:11]** Let me know if you can see this at the Akatonian Museum of History.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** I got a shake from Benny and a nod from Kev.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Yes.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I have visuals.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** You have visuals.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Let's practice those commands now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, it's paused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** It's paused.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** I don't have vision and stream doesn't have vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Whoa.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:32]** So for the listener, while they're fixing the vision for our viewers, I'll give you a little insight.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** We are in what looks like a museum.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** It's a golden museum.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:47]** It shows the floor, and there are different rectangles, but on each of these rectangles, there are skeletons of large creatures.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:59]** It looks like maybe a starship on one of them, and there's some junk on another, like the side of a starship that was torn away or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** It's also some interesting-looking plant life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** Right.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** And there's a red crystalline-looking thing.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:14]** So, yes, we're definitely in some kind of museum or display center.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:19]** And all four of us are here, interestingly.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I don't see any.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:24]** Four officers of a, what did you say it was?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:28]** Special Tactics and Raid Squadron.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** You know, just hanging out at a museum together.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** No big deal.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** And the job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:39]** I think there's a Yosuke down in the corner with a gun that might be interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** Oh, I see him now.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** They're kind of all over.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Where do you see the Yosuke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Wait, did you ping?

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** I missed it.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Oh, okay.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** There is a Yosuke with a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** What is the open carry policy on Mars?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** Now I see something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** That's a great question.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** This is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** I have a feeling that could be our commander, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:08]** Let's wait for Vinny to get to stream and we'll get back to the... No, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:12]** You don't get to stream anything while we're exploring this map with our eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** While we're exploring with our eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Let's get it.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Let's get it.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** There are a lot of people inside this museum.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** I'm getting there.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** They're alive.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** I'm getting there.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Okay.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** Describe that because otherwise I'll start pointing out everyone.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:29]** No, you just need to let me talk and then we'll be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** I'm just going to talk to you, which goes against our rules, but it's fine.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Hashtag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Yeah, I'm already talking.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** You can't talk over me.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Okay.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Is the anger already happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** I'm going to like.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Kev is just.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** It is not 2 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** It's 2 a.m.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:51]** Is this why we all buy Kev Dr. Pepper so that he can drink it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Just keep him calm.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** Yeah, we're buying him four bottles he has to drink all four.

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:05]** The sun comes through as in the distance you can see that you are quite high up the Morrow Cliffs.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** You can almost see the edge above, meaning that you are...

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:19]** In a pretty good part of town, the Akatonian Museum of History, the sun comes in in the colors of red, orange, and yellow.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:40]** And you can tell that the museum has been decorated especially in bright brown, oranges, yellows, as is custom on the day of Solar's Edge, the last day that the sun will dip below Maro's surface for a month.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:55]** The museum is otherwise as fashionably appointed, so tasteful all throughout, as a testament to this growing appreciation and movement for Akiton's past.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:01]** This is probably, you know, at least 150, 200 feet by 100 feet.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:05]** And as y'all were saying earlier, there are bones of animals.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** There's flora, fauna.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** There does appear to be a spaceship there.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:16]** And you all are at the... Oh, what's it called?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Ah, yeah, that's right.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:37]** The Ringworks Rings to Life Auction for Charity, where you all will be... You understand that in your growing success as the Stars team for the past year, you will get a bit of recognition, right?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** And with that, I will say that there are a good amount of people around.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** Some of them are all dressed in more corporate wear.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Some seem to be some creatives.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:54]** They've tried to pull a lot of people from the community to come celebrate.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** And there are a couple â€“ there's tables for auctions.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** There's some local celebrities here.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** There's some swag.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** There's some food.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** There's an open bar.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** It's a pretty good time.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:19]** And I want to ask you as I unpause the game, and I will let you put yourself where I think you would be as we come into this scene.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** So I'm going to unpause now.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** Kara, where would you be as we come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:31]** Kara would be as uncomfortable with this as possible.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:45]** She detests these sort of sycophantic social situations of people pleasers and things like that.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:52]** She's very into her work and the safety of Morrow and

**[00:46:52 - 00:47:07]** doesn't want to be distracted or compromise her integrity in any way so she would just be quietly observing nodding politely and not like opening her mouth like she's not drinking she's not doing anything okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:14]** Maybe you're walking around reading some of the signage on the exhibits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:18]** I think she would just be standing in the corner, people watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Oh, okay.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** That is even better.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Even better.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** Fantastic.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Just people watching.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:30]** Feel free to place yourself in whichever corner you would like to be standing in.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Are we getting recognized?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Is that what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:42]** That is part of why you have been asked to come today is that you understand that there's going to be some recognition for your success.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Is there like a stage?

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** There is up at the top of the screen.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** There are.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:57]** Yeah, there are a couple flights of stairs all leading up to one stage that overlooks the entire city from there.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** And who's this person behind this?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:07]** So there is, you all are standing, or well, if you're currently standing in this upper left corner, there is... It's like the entrance right here?

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:11]** Yeah, so there are six entrances to the whole place.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:15]** And they're both on, there's three on the left and three on the right.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** There are three kind of short hallways that you can walk through.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:23]** And right behind you, next to this large...

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:31]** exhibit of green and purple plants that are curling around that look like they could just gobble you up.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** But they're behind glass, so it's fine.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:40]** Next to them is a Hilkie in a wheelchair who seems to be monitoring all the AV.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** You can tell that they are moving around.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Sometimes they'll have a little iPad.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** They're going back.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** They're checking lighting.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** They're making sure that everything's good and otherwise relaxing.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:56]** Kev, what is, should I say Cecil or should I say Remy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Your name's Cecil right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** I go by Cecil to my friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Okay.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Cool.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Yeah.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** So where would you be?

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** What would you be up to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:09]** Well, I'm trying to think.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** It looks like there's food down to the bottom.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** There is food.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:23]** Cecil, I think he'd probably walk in with the group and would just say, I've never been to anything like this.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** I've always lived at the very bottom of Morrow.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:30]** There's no way my family would ever... I wish I could bring my family here.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** My kids would love this place.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** And I think he would kind of just hang out with the group as they dispersed.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** Well, it sounds like Kara is staying up there, hanging out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:46]** I think he would have probably followed the other guys.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:49]** She's just going to stand in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** Okay, what about Boom?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** What are you doing?

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** You hanging out with Kara?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:59]** You walking with Cecil?

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** Sorry, not Boom.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** I meant to say Migo.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** Getting used to these new names.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Yeah.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:11]** Migo, I think, is in where... Because this seems like a semi-formal event.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** You'll see folks in their dress blues and suits and ties.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** I think Migo is in his normal work wear, and he's just put a tie on.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Okay.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Love it.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:31]** He's studied up on the rules of these social engagements, so he's got his two drink tickets, and he's ready to drink a light beer.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:44]** And he's probably never been to this museum before, so he's roaming around and taking in the sights, but really this is just a necessary evil in...

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** getting his work done.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Like they got it.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** They tell him where to be and what to do.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** And this is just part of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Okay.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** What about boom?

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Are you back on foundry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Boom is, uh, almost there.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:04]** By his name, his name, his full name is Vladislav Maskevitz, by the way.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** Uh, but his, his birth name is boom for sure.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:35]** okay yeah oh so his birthday is boom but he goes well no he goes by boom to you guys his nickname is like yeah you guys you guys are fine you're cool you check out for boom um yeah love it yeah i mean you all have been successful as a group the four of you the first iteration of the stars group you've been successful for successful for for the past year so you've definitely developed your own camaraderie um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:43]** Well, Boom basically is like, you know, he, you know, with the cigar in his mouth, like, looks at the alcohol and he's like, it's poison.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** But then, like, he doesn't, like, drink alcohol.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** It's not really good for you.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** And then he, like, you know, puffs his way over to the giant dinosaur.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Yeah.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** And then just kind of like.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Yeah, to the large.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Yeah.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:59]** Kind of like, you know, puffs, looks at it and, like, nods.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Respect for this large dead beast.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** And just kind of, like, waits for the action to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** Okay.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** You're waiting for the programming to start.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** I like it.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:15]** And I see... I'm going to stick with Migos.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Yeah.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Will.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:23]** Does Kara see anyone she recognizes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Great question.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Great question.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** You do.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:36]** Actually, you see standing on the other side, on the right side of this large dinosaur between the starship and what appears to be the wreckage of some larger vessel.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:47]** You see the familiar side profile of Commander Bolt reading one of the descriptions of the starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** So this one's Commander Bolt.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** No, this is Commander Bolt down here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** Commander Bolt is on the west side of the room.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** There's another character near the middle that we have yet to identify.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** Do you walk up to Commander Boom or are you just trying to see?

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** You're trying to take notice.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** I'm just taking notice.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** Taking notice.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Okay.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Okay.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:14]** Cecil and Migo, you're talking and then you hear this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Hey.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** How are you guys?

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Hey.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** And you look down.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** And you see a Raxalite.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** Oh, God.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:31]** And it's your pal, Lieutenant Lua, who is here from out of town, but very happy to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Hey, how have you been?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** A little lipped in it.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Hi, Lieutenant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Oh, hey, boom, I didn't see you.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Come on over here, boom, come on, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Boom makes his way over.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Long time no see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Migo turns to him but says nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Don't mind, amigo.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** She's kind of in my head today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** He has always just been the kindest, sweetest soul.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Never says a word, so that's okay.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** That's all good.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Boba, how have you been?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** It's so good to see you.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:04]** I hope you enjoyed the new weapon that I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** It is very big.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Fold many around.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** I'm very excited for it, and I can't wait to put it to use.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** So thank you, Lieutenant, as always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** That's exactly what I got on the order, too.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** It was this big and round, and I knew it was perfect for you, so it's great.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Good, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:39]** You know that Lieutenant Lua was with you for the first six months and then has moved to another city, but is still in charge of a lot of the supply and a lot of the weapons throughout this region, and then in particular, Morrow.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** And she's come back in town for this.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Rick.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** She's our child.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Rick.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Cecil.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Yeah.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** Old habits die hard.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** So you start talking to Lua.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** Kara is still hanging off in the corner.

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:02]** I think at some point Commander Bolt walks over to you, Kara, and just walks up and says, Hello, Commander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:06]** These aren't really your functions either, huh?

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Not exactly, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Yep.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** I understand that.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Just part of what we got to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Yeah.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:22]** I'm here to fulfill whatever duties are necessary, but I'm not very comfortable in these sort of situations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Sure.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Yeah.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** No, I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** Well, look, from my understanding, it should be pretty quick.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** They're going to have their corporate speeches like they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:40]** And we'll just need to stand and wave and you all be the incredible people that you are.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** And then we'll move back to protecting tomorrow.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Sorry, protecting tomorrow.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** That being said, I don't know.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** It might be of interest to you.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:52]** There are some pretty great items on the auction here.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:57]** I mean, not that we're going for them, but it's pretty neat to see up close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:01]** What exactly do you have in mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:05]** Well, it looks like there is some sort of a weapon that's like a pre-gap.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:15]** There is, I think, some technology that comes from, if I remember, from a battle with the Swarm that they're auctioning off.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:21]** I believe there's a radar that was one of the first to detect the Swarm, actually.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** Just some neat stuff that I thought that you might be interested in.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** But, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:31]** Yeah, I could check that out if you think it'd be good to check out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Sure.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Where is it?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Yeah.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** It's actually in the second hallway.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** It's up to you.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** It's all good.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** It's in the second row past the large dinosaur.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** She points off to somewhere in the distance that you don't really know where it is.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** where there are eight tables laid out.

**[00:56:48 - 00:57:01]** And then she also walks over to talk with Cecil and Migo and Boom and Lua and just check in with you all and see how things are going.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:10]** As you're talking, is there anything that anybody wants to kind of do or explore in terms of, like, food?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** You do know that, like I said, there's swag.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** There's this auction stuff that you can look at.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** There's a guessing game.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** And there's also just exploration of these different things in the museum.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** So feel free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** What kind of swag are we talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Explain swag, yeah.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:37]** Dude, it is both Goldvein Census swag, who you know, again, Goldvein Census is the larger group that STARS is a part of.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:48]** Goldvein Census itself actually controls, it's a network of avatar and temples that authenticates good, notarizes deals, encourages a lot of economic growth.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** They're a big player.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** So they have swag.

**[00:57:51 - 00:58:00]** Ringworks Industries, who were the individuals who helped come in, sponsor, set up the STARS program.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** They were kind of the financiers.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** They helped be on board.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** They have a lot of swag.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** And it's a good quality swag.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:16]** They have sent you some good water bottles, some good shirts, some good hats, things that may be friends or family.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:29]** Also, maybe a couple of data pad holders, a couple of new cred stick holders that allow faster transaction times, things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:46]** i'm gonna grab some of that for my kids and my wife i think they'd really appreciate some of the swag stuff you anybody want to go with you y'all let's do it wait where is counter for that that's over oh yeah all right yeah good it's over in the corner say hi to lua


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:50]** and just sort of roll her eyes at YouTube getting swag.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** She's like, this is potentially compromising.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** I don't want to be seen in the pocket of others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** All right, yeah.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** Yeah, that is part of what we have to do, for sure.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** We don't want to always advertise that we're going to be in the pocket of others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:17]** You can tell that she's trying to connect with you, but she has to work with vendors every day and work with supplies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:23]** She's probably the one that got us the connections to Goldvain and Greenworks.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:32]** I see that the three of you, Boom, Migo, and Cecil, have actually walked over to the game table.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I don't know what we're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Where's the swag table at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** The signage at this party is terrible.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:44]** The signage on Foundry is terrible, but good thing that your characters don't know that you're in a simulation.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:47]** Sorry, excuse me.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** We're not even real.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** So the swag table...

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:02]** But as you're walking over there, you do see this older woman who is standing there and is sitting and talking to three lovely individuals.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:07]** And then as you walk up and maybe are not sure where to go, she's like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]** Oh, do you want to guess the Marimaro beans?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** You can win free Marimaro beans for life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** All right, I'll try.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** What do I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** Okay, so you see all these cylinders?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** Go ahead and guess how many beans are in the cylinders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** How many cylinders do I see?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:24]** I can't see any.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Six.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** You see six cylinders.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]** Each of them has to figure out how many beans are in each of these cylinders.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** No, total, total, total, total.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:40]** Is she going to do like a thing where they like, you know, that like moving around and like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:45]** Give me either a perception check or let's see.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** I would say either wisdom or intelligence, whichever you want to go off of.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:54]** You can do physical science, whichever you think is probably most apt for your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Alright, they will try something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:01]** Well, I rolled a three on my die, so... I have a seven in physical science.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Okay.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** So, yeah, Cecil starts to just kind of count the beans down.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** You're like actually counting the beans, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** I think he loses track halfway through.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Love it.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:15]** Love it.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** Miko got a 17 on perception, so he looked pretty closely at the first two and got bored.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:24]** Um... He's like...

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:28]** I'm going to say you've got 220.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Okay.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** All righty.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** 220.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** How tall is Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** Migo is 6'3".

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:38]** So he bends like all the way down, just at the hip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:39]** Yeah.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Looks out over the bench, steps out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** Amazing.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** And, Kari, you are not going to check out the swag.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Are you checking out the game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** I was going to check out the ancient weapons on auction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:06]** So you head over, you do see that there appears what we know to be a pistol that looks very similar to what we would have in our world.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:11]** But it is on auction, listed as found at a planet in the vast.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** Yeah, pretty ancient technology.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** All right.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** He rolls a 14.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** He pulled a Kevin, and it's just a 14.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** So I don't know what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** Pulled a Kevin and gets a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** No, no, no.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** That's pretty good.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** You all feel pretty confident about your guesses.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** I'm sure that Cecil also feels pretty confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** So basically there's no help, so I just have to randomly guess is what you're saying?

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** I'm going to guess 700.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** I have no context for this.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Okay.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:05]** No, it's... I can't wait to find out if John actually has a number written down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** I know.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:09]** John, I have an eight, a plus eight in acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:14]** If you let me do a flip where I can see the beans, like, you know, I'll do that to, like, give me, like, a tip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** All right, fine.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** Do a flip to see how many beans are at the bottom.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** Because you flip with it in your hand.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** I flip the cups, and they're so fast, they don't even know that they flipped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** That's how good my acrobatics are.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** And then I can see.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:30]** That's very good acting.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** I am very, very impressed.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:16]** And there is a human who steps forward up.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:22]** A human woman who steps forward up, maybe about halfway up the steps.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]** And looks over at the person doing A.V.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** And just kind of gives them a knowing nod.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:32]** And they, you know, take down all the music.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:35]** And there's just kind of a quiet in the room.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** And they say,

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** I'm excited for that.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** Just about to announce how many Marrow Beans there are.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Yeah.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** We need to know.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:02]** Here is the answer to the Mari Marrow Bean question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** What was that you said?

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** If you're close, but you're not exactly.
