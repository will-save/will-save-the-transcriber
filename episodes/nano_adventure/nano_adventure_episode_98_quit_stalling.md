**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Yeah.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** One of these things is not like the others.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** You used to be able to do the Snapchat filter.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Yeah.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I was going to say, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** There's a Snapchat filter for will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** Um, check it out.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** It's really good.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Actually, it still exists.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** I think so.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** So that's cool.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** Well, look, let's roll over last week's topic.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** We talked last week about favorite starter Pokemon.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:14]** I was really limiting the selection pool there, but I got to know, because of Kelly, what's your favorite Pokemon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Thank you for asking.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Magikarp.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:22]** I'm guessing it's Magikarp.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Magikarp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** With that Neville Longbottom blow up.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** That's true.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** That's very true.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Wait, does Magikarp ever go through a glow up?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Turns into Gyarados.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Gyarados, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Yeah, whatever.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I don't like Magikarp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** And you call yourself a Pokemon trainer.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** One of like three dragon Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** I'm sorry.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** I'm a poser.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** But I do like, for me, I like Wooper.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** He's probably my favorite.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** But if I had to choose among the first 151, it would be Arcanine.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Yeah.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** So Vinny knows.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** Arcanine.

**[00:02:52 - 00:03:10]** whooper has like a football shaped head like hey arnold yeah and then like uh he's really cute that's not a 151 though it doesn't count it's second gen shut up not everyone is limited to the original 151 like you are yeah arcanine's also cool but by the one i hate is cyther

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** So we've found it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** We've found where Kelly and my tastes diverge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Look at this lonesome place.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** It's cold, man.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** It's sad.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** It's dark.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** No sooner did John say, what's your favorite Pokemon?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** I was like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Scyther!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:36]** Vinny, there's no way anyone's favorite Pokemon can be Scyther.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I really like Scyther.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Why?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:46]** As a strategic gameplay, from that perspective, Scyther's terrible.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Don't own Scyther.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Don't run him.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** It's terrible.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Oh, I thought you were going to say that was the one good point.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** The storyline, him in the story of Pokemon, in the shows...

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:10]** lovable character he's useful he's got witty retorts when he just says his name he's got little blades on his arms he's cute like i believe in the game he was like he's not any of this true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** If you didn't have Bulbasaur, because Bulbasaur could learn Cut.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** If you didn't have Bulbasaur, you had to get Scyther, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** There were a few Pokemon that you could teach Cut to.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** I forget which ones.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Question.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Kelly and Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Do you have to be mortal enemies now?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Do you have to be nemesis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** They have to fight each other in a Pokemon gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** Well, yeah, I'm going to have to fight Scyther, basically.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** But I won't fight it with Wooper, let's be real.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** It's got to be Arcanine.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Arcanine will do well against Scyther.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** That's true.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** Fire.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** Is this like a Logan Paul, like, we need to start selling tickets to this fight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** At Gen Con?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** At Gen Con, Indianapolis, in, what is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** August 1st through 4th?

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** You guys got, like, what, six months to actually obtain a Scyther and an Arcanine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** If we have a meetup...

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** This is the headline.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Is you two fighting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Yeah.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** I think so.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Wait, okay, hold on.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** I take such issue with everything that you said, though.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Hold on, how is it cute?

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** You're just like, oh, he has little pincers on his hand.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** How is that cute?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** How is he cute at all?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:20]** He's like a weird praying mantis of a thing that doesn't shut up.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** It's the worst voice ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** He's cute how Gundams are cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** They're not cute.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** No Gundams are cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** They are.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Which Gundam is cute, Vinny?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:35]** So, like, they've got, like, the body proportions of kind of, I couldn't name a Gundam.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** I just, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** With every sentence, you are straying further from the light of God.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Like, you're just, like, going, you guys forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** Vinny was a Digimon kid, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Digital monsters.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Yep.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** That's true.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** I am the devil's advocate of a lot of our conversations.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** I almost set up the group, but I don't think that's true.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** No, that's not true.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** He can fly, which is also useful.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Oh my


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** Will, have you been Googling Pokemon to choose a favorite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** I can't hear a word you're saying, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:18]** Have you been Googling Pokemon to choose a favorite, or are we just waiting to inundate you with a bunch of Pokemon at Gen Con?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** Yeah, I feel like it has to be at Gen Con.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** This has to be decided.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** My initiation into Pokemon.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** This is it.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Will it happen?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** What will the outcome be?

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** Find out.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:32]** August 1st through 4th.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** Alright, I'll get my Arcanine going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Kev?

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** My favorite Pokemon, just because it's adorable, is Cubone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Cubone!

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Cubone is cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:58]** This is recent, like the last year or two that I've seen this, where people have been like, wait, Cubone is just a Charmander that has lost its parent and put their skull over its head and the flame went out on its tail.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** And you put them side by side and you're like, ooh...

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** Yeah, Pokemon, the artists, they really... Yep.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Wow.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** But Cubone's adorable.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** And is that why Marowak is so, like, absolutely aggressive?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** Like, it's just... Yeah.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** It's got a chip on its shoulder.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** It's looking for its episode of Criminal Minds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** Right.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Right.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** It's trying to guest star.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** Growlithe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** That's the junior version of Arcanine.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I was like, Arcanine.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Growlithe.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Can I say that?

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:42]** Finder said I don't have a favorite Pokemon because I'm an adult.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Come on.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** And you know what?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** We're not playing this game anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Speaking of being adults, let's play Starfinder.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Let's play Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** Yeah.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** Jumping into it.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:05]** Hey, so we talked about this, I think, two episodes ago, a couple episodes before that.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:11]** But we do have a sentence that we want to give out to one of us.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** So I'm going to roll my die.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** You can tell us who it's from, right?

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Let's just... Sure, sure, sure.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** It is from...

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:44]** taco mug from okay for supporting us and thank you for submitting all right so i have randomly determined who this will be and i am messaging that person right now on everybody look at your discord of the exact discord on discord i'm messaging them now i have sent the message to that person let's get started let's get back

**[00:09:44 - 00:10:13]** to reality alright there goes gravity you all last time made short work of the Yosuke IFF agents in the lobby of the new that's offensive because they're little because Yosuke's are small that is exactly why I said it I said short work classic yeah classic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:18]** A short joke that I'm too tall to understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** It went right over.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** It went right between your legs.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** Not even there.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** What was the short joke?

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Did Kevin say it?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** It's cool.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** You're also too tall to get it, so I'm not going to repeat it.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** So you were fighting in the lobby against these Yusokis.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Knock them out.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** They even recognize you.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Maybe they would ask for your autograph.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** Probably not.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** But

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:47]** But they did recognize the hammer and Kara Valtara before you guys nonlethally took them out.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:54]** You investigate the room that one of the Yusokis was in, the security room.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:03]** After a good amount of computing on the last chance, you are able to break into the computer, see three things.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:07]** A memo from Leora Huxley to the security crew.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:14]** You were able to see the layout and subsequent traps in this office building.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** In this part of the office building.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** And you were able to see the cameras.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** Just want to say, Will slash Cara, really like the idea of tapping the feed.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:27]** I know that the 10 minutes was kind of your... I think your decision to not spend that much time putting it in.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** But that's a really cool idea.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** So...

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** You know, maybe that's something you want to carry over in a threefold.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** I don't know.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** That's cool.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** It's an unusual avenue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:40]** I don't have the augmentation for a nanite collector tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** I don't know.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** Bernice is very capable.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** You never know if Bernice will just somehow be able to do that, too.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** Because I feel like she can do so many things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** I guess I could level her a little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** A little RF broadcast?

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** Bernice will win threefold for us, I feel like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:00]** at the end so many abilities it will be Bernice alone by herself

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** The briefcase made it out alive.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** Everyone else is dead.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** You think you're dead.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** It's like the end of Batman.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:16]** You think you're dead, and then you just zoom in on a briefcase sitting outside a cafe, drinking a coffee, pulling out a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** And he drives a car down the coast of France.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:57]** incredible me too me too that's so funny alright and then you determine through Kara's excellent nano electro location abilities that obviously cross referencing with the layout of the building that you have and the cameras that there is a bar where the only other occupants you see are a bartender and a Yosuke IFF agent sitting at the bar seems a little awkward seems maybe a little tense can't see too much from the camera

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:05]** And through the electrolocation, you determine that there's somebody in the bathroom or something.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** Something in the bathroom.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** Like a poo-poo's.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** Before we get there, I want to remind you, you do have Archie with you.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** And Archie so far has been streaming what's been happening.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:23]** So there's data and logs, as well as providing information through Commander Bolt or Lieutenant Lua whenever possible.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:28]** But you, the players, have an option to use Archie.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:36]** To get a plus two bonus to perception rolls and a plus two to attack rolls once per combat.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** So just once per combat.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** So you can choose one attack that you're like, this needs to hit.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:44]** And Archie can move into that location, be able to give you some data.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Help you get there.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Don't forget that.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Got some stuff on your sides.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** As well as your kit.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** Y'all have been awesome about using your kits and your nano abilities.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** It's good stuff.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Let's go back.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Jumping on the map over here.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** Back to the bathroom.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** We have stacked up in front of each bathroom door.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Miko in front of door number one.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Boom in front of door number two.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:10]** And Kara Valtara in front of door number three.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:19]** Cecil standing on the sink with a giant pike.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Love it.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Just going to say love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** It's a very small bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Really crowded.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** Really, really crowded.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** It really is.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Super crowded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Super nice, but very small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Very cold, though.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:38]** There's definitely a distinction between the warm lobby and the cold bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** You know, this is not an ADA approved bathroom.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Because?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:45]** Because there's not a stall that's wide enough for a wheelchair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** You're right.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** These are all... They're five-foot stalls.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** How big is an 88?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Are there anyone in wheelchairs in Starfinder?

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** Do they have a technological solution to these kinds of things at this point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** Paizo has done an awesome job, I will say truthfully, of incorporating... I think it's in Galactic Magic.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:08]** They have a wheelchair for more accessible...

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:30]** technology that helps out of any race and actually i think the precog iconic character is in a wheelchair and it's super uh it's actually super cool because they built a lot of stuff that you can do with the wheelchair and any other accessible needs for whatever else you need that's cool yeah we'll just assume that the ada bathroom is on the other side yeah yeah

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** All right.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** I'm going to unpause the game.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:40]** I believe we ended last time with a countdown, and you all are just going to kick down the door, yeah?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** You guys ready?

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** Three, two, one.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Open up in there.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Boom.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** No one is here.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** You open up the door.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:55]** Kara Valtara is looking immediately at a VESC IFF agent.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** With the gun pointed directly at Cara.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** I need you to roll for initiative.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** I get to take an action.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** They also get to take an action.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Which action goes first?

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Initiative.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** I'm adding you all to the...

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** carousel right now.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Okay, do I get to put my number in myself or no?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:25]** Yes, so if you want to put your number in yourself, you should be able to click on the dice.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:32]** What you'll see come up is the initiative roll on Foundry, thank you Foundry, that says formula, situational bonus, and roll mode.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Yes, do you see that?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** No.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** I clicked on the dice.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** What do we click on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** So when you click on the carousel, you see your picture at the top.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Click on the little die.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:45]** If you click on the carousel icon on the left side, it'll come up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Yeah, there's a carousel at the bottom of your tree.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Oh, okay.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** And then there's a die tactic on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Yeah.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:55]** And now here's... So you want your roll mode to say self-rolls.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** That way only you see it.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** No one else sees it.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Okay.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** There's no situational bonus in this sense.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** Hit roll.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** And you will see another thing that says roll request should come up.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** You see that?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Yeah.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Okay.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:13]** Now, just like it says, if you rolled a real die, type in your number in that box.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Where?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:20]** As the second pop-up window, after you've clicked on your die, you'll see the roll.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Can I do self-roll?

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:45]** you do self-roll yeah yeah you should do self-roll then hit roll you'll see another window come up it says roll request you'll see it says 1d20 if if you want to roll with foundry you just hit submit if you want to roll your own die and then input your number put it in there that's it that's all it takes and you put in you put in the number on the die not the number plus your money correct correct because the modifiers are included because i've already added your modifier so cool

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:51]** I think I'm going to carry this over to threefold if you guys like it, because I think it's just an easy way to let you decide if you want to roll yourself or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Sometimes it's nice, sometimes it's not.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Yeah, mine did not calculate that correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** Okay, I might have your initiative incorrectly.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** Let's go around the horn for the listeners on audio anyway.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** And for everybody, Migo, what is your initiative?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Thirteen.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Thirteen, noted.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Cecil, what is your initiative?

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** I got three.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Three, that is correct.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** Kara Valtaro, what's your initiative?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Car rolled a one.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Ooh.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** But I get a plus four.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** That's kind of weird.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** You get a plus four.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** Okay, so that is fine.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** So I will update your initiatives to have that in there.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** And boom, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** 18, and my modifier is plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Woo!

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:52]** so 19 okay i will add your modifiers into this that was on me that was my fault all right let's get going so we do have at the top of the round this vest has a has a ready to action for when the door to open to shoot at cara or whoever is there see so you also have an action that's a ready to action to bop them

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:08]** to bop them i think uh i think my vote is to go by initiative here technically the the iff agent has a higher initiative than you so i think they're ready to actually go before you i believe that's how we do it in uh

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** In surprise rounds, find her, let us know, or anybody else.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** So, they're going to shoot at Kara.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** Let's see what they get with their tactical railgun.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** And I believe they're shooting at you, Kara, so you get an AOL.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:26]** Because you're within five feet if you have your melee weapon out.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Drop it!

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Plus two.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Add two to it.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Let me know what you get.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Free now?

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:38]** Yeah, because you go before the action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** So I can try and disarm?

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** Thank you, Finder, for keeping us honest.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** There's no AOLs in the first round of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Not before you take your first action in the combat.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** I forgot about that.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** That was on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** We have rules paralegal on site.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** This is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** on-site.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Can we have it on-site every time?

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** It's very helpful.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Okay, I'm sorry about that, Will.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I led you astray.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** How dare you.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** But I hope that you disarm soon.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** That would be rad.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:12]** All right, I'm going to go with the foundry roll because I like the way that they randomly generate numbers here.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** That is going to be against you, Kara.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:18]** That is a 28 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** Yeah, that obviously hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** Yeah, that definitely 100% hits.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:27]** You take nine points of piercing damage as the tactical railgun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:34]** As that happens, I see nanites kind of just fly off Kara.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:40]** And I used defensive dispersal to reduce the damage by four.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** And gained a plus one on my next save.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Dude.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Y'all with the nanites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** You're leaning into it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I like it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** That's cool.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** It was nine total?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** It was nine.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** So you take five, right?

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Yeah.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Love it.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** So maybe if you're the nanites, splat the mirror next to you, Cecil.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:05]** It is a surprise round, so Cecil, you get a move or a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** A standard action.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** I'm ready to action to bop him in the nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** Okay.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** There is... I think there's cover.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Not only is there a wall, but there's also a wall, right?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** It doesn't stack, though, so it's going to be a plus four.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Right, so it's a plus four.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Plus four to their AC.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Oh, oh, oh.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Their KAC.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Oh, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Oh, God.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:31]** That was a three total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Okay.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Stabs Kara in the neck.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** Yeah.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Rough.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** Rough.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Not good.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** All right.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** So, bounces off the wall.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** Maybe even the ceiling because you're in a tight quarter there.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** All right.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** We are at the top.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Around one.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Boom.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** It's your turn.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Are you blowing the place or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:49 - 00:22:11]** he would love to he doesn't want to hurt his good old capitan though so uh boom is going to switch to another gun uh which is his uh utility breaching gun because he is going to punch through um the bathroom stall from this end this gun is particularly good

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Love it.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** All right.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Let's change things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** There are many ways to go boom.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:49]** so let's hope that this does something oh my god um well okay i'm trying to if i'm trying to get an inanimate object like do i need to make the same like attack roll basically and like what would it what would it be for something like a bathroom but there's a hardness though so you like you automatically hit but then there's the heart the hardness of the wall


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** I'm going to Google hardness of a bathroom stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:57]** That's not... I feel like you're going to get a lot there.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** A European bathroom stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Be sure to specify European.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** It's going to get a little bit better if it's European.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** You're really just striking out there.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:11]** What to look for in commercial bathroom stalls.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Just so that...

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Yeah, go ahead, Josh.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** There's a hardness and there's a hit points.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:21]** The hardness is going to just... I believe it's going to just take away from your damage.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** It's deducted, right?

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:28]** Only damage in excess of the hardness is deducted from the hit points.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** So because of this, right?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** And it will have its own hit points.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** So when you shoot, your damage will... The hardness will be subtracted.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** The rest will go through the hit points.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** I'm trying to find out both of those parameters right now, hardness and hit points.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:46]** Well, for the gun, it says hardness 13, hit points 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** Well, that's for the gun itself.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** To do any of this, I think you have to step into the bathroom stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:53]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** What's a gun, though?

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:59]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:05]** If you wanted to breach a wall, you wouldn't want to be perpendicular to that wall.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** It says range 20 feet, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** You're right next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** Honestly, you want to be at a 45 degree angle when breaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** So, here's the thing.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** Breakdown... Let's break objects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:21]** If I was trying to shoot, like, the hinges off, like, a door frame or, like... Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:27]** If you were trying to... If you were shooting the hinges off, you'd be trying to knock a pin and, like, rollers out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** Like, if you were just trying to put a hole in the wall... The angle of deflection you want.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** So...

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** If we're talking about a frame charge, then absolutely.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:42]** It's a strip that's on the door or the wall, right?

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:50]** But you're talking about just taking a shotgun and slugging down a bolt or a door.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:55]** So, yes, I do want you to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:06]** I am assuming that the table 1111 on page 408 in my copy of the Coro book is somehow inclusive of all materials and composite materials and building materials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** You should probably be able to shoot through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, I think you can.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:14]** However, I would say that this is probably... But it would reduce the damage.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Right.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** So the wood has a hardness of 5, 10 hit points.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** So here's the thing.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** You would need to break through.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** You're shooting through once.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:28]** I'm guessing it's going to take probably two shots to shoot through to actually get through the wall itself.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** I am assuming what the contractor used and the value engineering of the whole building.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** But...

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** Yeah, so his attack will be against the wall.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** He'll probably hit.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** Five points of damage will be deducted immediately because of the hardness.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Whatever is after that will deduct from the hit points of the wall itself.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** What do I need to pass to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:50]** So if he hits for 15... I mean, you hit automatically because it's an inanimate object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Right, yeah.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** So I think you do.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, so roll your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** So do a double attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** It's a door, yeah.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** I'm not sure I can because I switched weapons.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** That's a swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** You can't take a swift action and do it full.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Wait a second.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** You switched weapons before opening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** Why don't you just shoot with your normal weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** It's not as effective, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** Is your breaching weapon made to breach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** Yeah, it's specifically for breaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** Does it have some kind of skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** It's called Utility Breaching Gun.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** It's actually made to bust through some really good stuff.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** I feel like I could get through this door with one hit with this gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Breach ignores hardness.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** We are getting into the weeds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:44]** As a full action, you can use the breach against an adjacent stationary door or wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** if you're trained in engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** I am trained in engineering, but I don't know if I can run a full action.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:57]** But instead of making an attack roll, you attempt a strength check to break the object's DC and add the breach weapons item level to the check.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Oh my god.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:07]** Alright, so it's a quicker path to breaking the wall than working through the hardest and hit points method.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** So, what do you do?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** So you are rolling a strength check.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Okay.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Uh...

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** Well, I'm trained in engineering.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Yeah, you're trained in engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:18]** Okay, okay.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** Yeah.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** I don't think I'm going to be able to do it with strength.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I feel like I should just go with the regular gun.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** I'm not very strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** This has a breaching weapon as you as an engineer.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Hang on, hang on, hang on.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** There's another property of this weapon, penetrating.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:38]** Penetrating weapon is designed to punch through large objects out of layers, making it easier to damage them.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:42]** A penetrating weapon ignores an amount of hardness equal to the weapon's level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:42]** Love it.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:47]** A wooden door has, so you ignore hardness, a wooden door has 10 HP.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** So you would just need to break through.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** You can just shoot through.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Or no, sorry, it has, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Because it has a penetration property.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** The weapon's level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** Just roll damage and tell me the number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** You threw in the armor piercing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:06]** You ignore hardness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** It's level 12.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** Yeah, it's a good thing that I have a level 12 utility breaching gun.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** So, all right, cool.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Rolling for damage.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** It's six damage.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Doesn't break through.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** There's four hit points left.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Yeah, but good stuff.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Good stuff.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** I think it's an inch thick.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** It's about ten hit points.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** So there's four hit points left.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Very surprising.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** Gun punches like two little holes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** You can see his eyes.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** All of a sudden, can't do well on wood.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** Okay.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** Oh, well.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** We'll shoot a door.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** John, I'll show you what kind of damage it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** That's fine.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** That sounds good.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** I'm down.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** We are talking about a sci-fi weapon and a sci-fi game for a utility breaching gun.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** We're talking about a sci-fi wall.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Migo7, what are you doing?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** But I hear you well.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** I got you.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** Migo7, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:22]** um migo is going to uh pivot he's disappointed that there's not a bogey in front of him um he's gonna go to the back corner okay so you can all be nice and stacked up while he moves he's gonna pull out that azimuth laser rifle okay and take a shot at our soft curve reasonably covered uh fellow yeah reasonably covered for now that is a 20 on the die


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** All right.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** All right.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Yep.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** You might just take him out real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:35]** As you step over, you kind of slide car against the wall and then just blow the shit out of this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** The cavity from the nanites is just filled.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** It just refills with fire.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** With fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** I want the...

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** I want the deck.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** I don't want the bird 1D4.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** I want the critical success deck.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** We got a deck on deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:57]** Ready?

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** And three, two, one.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Stop.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Okay.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Stop, he says.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** What kind of damage is it?

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** Kinetic or energy?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Energy.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** Energy.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Splayed energy.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:18]** Make an additional attack without expending additional ammunition as if the attack had the blast weapon special property.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** I'm unfamiliar with the blast weapon special property.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Let's find out.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Blast weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:53]** weapon this is cool oh i think this gives you multiple attacks do i have to do that uh i mean you don't have to do the burn if you want to do the burn uh well like because you doing blast would just allow me to hit cara right do you have beef with cars not enough to shoot her in the back jokes jokes jokes just kidding all right so uh no it's not good no no all right so you want to do the burn instead yeah so roll your damage and add a d4 yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Roll your damage twice and add your bonuses.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Apologies.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** And add your bonuses twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Your joke was good.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** I just meant it's not good to shoot people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** No, it's good to explain jokes.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** It's not funny if you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** That's funny.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** I just don't want our dear Kara to be shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** I know.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** I don't either.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** I don't either.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** Well, as the GM, I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:19]** So then, if I'm reading this correctly... It's 400 points.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** I think you're right.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:27]** That is 11 points of... You actually give HP and stamina to Kara if you hit her.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:34]** That's 11 HP fire damage, and they're burning for 1d4 rounds?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Is that right?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** I think so.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Well, you would roll your burn damage separately.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** So what is your normal attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** So the normal attack is 1d8.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** I rolled 2d8s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Just 1d8 flat, no bonuses?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** No bonuses.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Okay, so 2d8s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** That gives you your attack.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Yeah.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** So that was 11.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** 11 fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** And then I forget with burn, who rolls?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** It says burn for some of your rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** It says burn 1d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:21]** yes that's 1d6 of damage you roll 1d6 and then they have burn until they put it out they have their quality okay and they actually roll the wrong die but i kind of want to keep the rule no you gotta roll the die bro sorry physics is not agreeing with you okay three three burn damage three burn damage 11 points of damage three burn damage and they are on fire for how long i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** until they put it out.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** They have to, it's a move action or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** What if they're dead?

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Oh, they're already dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** See, they don't even, they're just burning.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** I like that the stall is just getting, the stall should be on fire too.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** It's just like getting punched through, it's on fire.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Truthfully.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I think that's the problem is like,

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:41]** He hits the ground or breaks the toilet and then he's on fire, but then the toilet water puts it out.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** So I don't think that's how it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** I don't think that that's how that works.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:49]** I think their body is on fire and we're going to stay in initiative order.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** Cause, uh, boom is just boom.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** Just killed, uh, this IFF agent that was on the toilet.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Sorry.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** Migo killed IFF agent, uh, cards, cards, your turn.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** This could be a fire hazard.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** What?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** What?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Really?

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** No.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Really?

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** You don't think so?

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Aren't they burning?

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** No?

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** It's also a tile bathroom.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** It's not gonna... Who cares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** Alright, alright.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** It's fine.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** They're not like flames.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** It's... Hey, you never know.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Let them cook.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Wait, is it really dead?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** She walks out.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** They are really dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** What?

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** She just reaches forward and flushes the toilet.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:30]** If the building goes up in flames, the building goes up in flames.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** Call the fire department.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** I was very much looking forward to getting through, but wow.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** That was easy.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:43]** I guess if you need something dead, give it to Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** That's great.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** All right.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** So you all walk out.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** We have that anticlimactic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** Everybody walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** It's literally on fire.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** We just leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** It's like fire.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** Are they still on fire?

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** I was thinking that that would be important to you all, but you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** And the toilet, I'm sure the valve on the toilet is broken now, and it's spraying water everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:12]** Does this thing not have fire sprinklers?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** My job, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Are there not fire sprinklers?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Look at the hardness on the toilet.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:23]** Migo's fire suppression system comes out of his crotch.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** There it is.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** And he puts out the vest.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Love it.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** On his way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** Cecil is going to kick open the other bathroom door and just clear this one as well.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Got you six.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** What do you do?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** And he moves in and he's just going to open each stall.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** One.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** One.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** And Migo beats him to the last one.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Nothing.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** You don't see anything.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** All clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:50 - 00:35:19]** right so if we go east I mean west there are what is it a waiting room an entertainment room yeah a couple storage areas and in the entertainment room there are three enemies I believe and the bartender yeah that's the plan what what are you shaking your head there you recall that there is one Yosuke IFF agent sitting at the bar and one bartender I thought there were two in the corner though somewhere


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Yeah, I thought there was one in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** Maybe not enemies, but the other people, right?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** No.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** No, I think the one in the corner was in the bathroom.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Yep.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Oh, okay, okay.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** My mistake.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Just one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** And then we go crit them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** With fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** With fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Okay.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** You all are stacked up at the western door.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:38 - 00:36:01]** so uh um i think we should breach from both sides what these other side where's the other side you have to go down you have to go outside right yeah you have to go outside i'm pinging on the map where it is if you recall there's a door to your far left that's the door that heads into a lounge and then from the lounge does this door into the bar

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** It is locked.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:06]** I'm going to say that you're able to just get it open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:09]** How do we split up for this pinstripe movement?

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Who goes who?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I feel like two seniors should have one more junior one.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** So, Cara, you can take someone, yeah?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** I'll stay with Cecil, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Miko, come with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Got your six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** We'll breach on my signal.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Get in position.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** What's the signal?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** 3, 2, 1, breach?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:39]** Cecil is going to hand boom a sticky grenade.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Or sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** I have a couple.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** Are you sure you want me to have this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** I have a few.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** No, no, it's fine.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** I'll keep this one then.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** But it might come in useful this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:36:53 - 00:37:00]** Migo's going to change his laser rifle for the pulse staccato rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:05]** Speaking of, we'll switch to his pulse staccato rifle at the same time.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Why the switch?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Well, just because like he has utility breaching gun.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** I feel like the, sorry, the squad machine gun is what he's going to redo.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** So, cause he doesn't want it.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** He's not breaching anymore.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Yeah.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** More so because it's, it's just close quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Like it's not sure.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Okay.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:27]** So Cara is going to attempt to do another electro location.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** She hasn't dismissed it yet.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** Um, just to get another read on the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:40]** You can tell that there are two creatures left in the area that you are electrolocating.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:44]** One is, they're very close to each other, within 10 feet.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:51]** And they are both about 40 to 50 feet directly in front of you, Kara, to the south of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** This is the hostage situation?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** The bartender and the Yusuke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** No.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** I don't imagine it's the hostage.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** It's a bartender and a Yusuke.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** With a gun sitting on the bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** They suck.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** He's probably keeping the bartender hostage with bad conversation or whatever.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** We need to like save the bartender.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Good tips.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** You guys, you guys ready to breach?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** All right.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** We're ready.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Three, two, one.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Execute.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Door's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:49]** uh migo and cara walk into a dimly lit lounge with two couches on either side and a chair at the top nice little stools nice place to chill seems like it's very intimate cozy there's a door directly across from you about 20 feet away meanwhile cecil and boom that arbitrarily opens sorry that was i yeah

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** That's cool.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** So Cecil and Boom walk up.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** There's a door across from you as well.

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:03]** You see that there's a door across from you and a door to the south that has the same – you can tell it's a more important door.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:08]** It's a larger transition from this area to somewhere else.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:11]** And there's a door on your right.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** to another area.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:21]** This is clearly a lobby or waiting room area where some people might sit, talk, have some intimate conversations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:25]** From the map that Boom saw, would he know what's behind those doors?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** The one on the south or the one on the right?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Just any of them, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** The one on the south, you're not sure.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:37]** The one on the right, you think that that's another storage or mechanical, electrical space.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** And the left one?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** The left one, you think this is to the bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Okay.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:46]** Migo has a look at the coffee table as he's clearing the room.

**[00:39:47 - 00:40:01]** He sees some apparel magazines and says to himself, Hey, dudes, why does all this Kasatha merchandise say you must construct additional pylons?

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** I don't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Dang it.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** I'm sorry.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Starcraft reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Okay, okay.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** Thanks, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** I got it.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** I didn't play Starcraft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Why was it that you said that, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** That was our written-in sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:22]** That was our written-in sentence!

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Both times!

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:28]** Dude, and props to both Kevin and Venny who have been able to sneak it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** I didn't realize it was a write-in, though.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Yeah, Takamon.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Starcraft-wise thing.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** I'm glad someone got the joke because I didn't play Starcraft either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:56]** we're just a generation behind on that yeah we did not play yeah yeah yeah i didn't want to get my ass kicked by like 12 year old koreans so i just didn't play all right so uh i like this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:08]** imagery switching uh back and forth two shots one of cecil and boom right behind cecil and cara and miko both on either side of two different doors ready to breach what's it going to be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** Going to breach, pierce the bar area, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** At position.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** All right.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Count us in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** I'm going to switch to my Pulsecaster rifle.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** I had my tactical rifle, but I'm going to switch.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Just saying.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** I mean, ready.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Ready?

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Ready.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Yeah.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Cara's got the flash.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Compliance ray.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Yeah.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Ready.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Go.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Go.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** We click it?

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** We're good.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Three, two, one, go.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** You all open the doors into another warm, lavish space.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:47]** Same design language as the lounge for those that were there with these beautiful orange diamonds on the floors.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** A nice bar.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** Sitting at the bar across from you is another Yosuke IFF agent nursing a drink.

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:15]** and a beautiful bar a hilkey bartender standing behind the bar as soon as you open the doors for a brief second you think maybe they were just chatting but boom the doors open the i'm guessing that you guys came in with this urgency and the yosuke's hand grips around the gun you need to roll for initiative

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** We can't even talk him down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** I guess we could just fly in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** Maybe you can talk him down in initiative order, but you are now moving and you stormed in.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Migo is in the room.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** Kara is right outside.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Boom is in.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** And where's Cecil?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** I'm right outside the door still.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Oh, Boom is right on top of Cecil.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** Yeah, let me add you guys to the carousel right now.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Did you update the initiative calc?

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:48]** I did not because I have to go in because I would have to update each of you and put your number in.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Cool.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:59]** So in the meantime, let me go ahead and ask, what did each of you get for your initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** I got a 15, and I was able to put it in myself.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** Nice.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** I'm so proud of myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Love it.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Migo, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Migo with the 12.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** Migo with the 12.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Boom.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Nine.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** My modifier is plus one, if that's already a factor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Okay, so you got a 10.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** And Kara Valtara, what'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** 19 plus three for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Ooh, 22.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Boom.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Top of it.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Love it.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Love it.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Love it.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Okay.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:47]** let's start combat i think the people who breached who would be who cecil and miko right yeah cecil was in the front this time yeah i i think the two of you get surprise rounds because you boom open the door not boom sorry that's a technical term uh so i'm getting confused

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** So that's going to be Cecil first.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** What do you do with your surprise round, move or standard?

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** And what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** I'm going to use a move action.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Okay.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** I'm going to unlock it so I can move myself.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:01]** I'm going to... Oh, you're not letting me... Okay.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:13]** Cecil is going to step into the room and trace the outside and just move towards fanning the room and keeping his gun aimed at the Yusuke.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** Okay.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** And he's going to shout on his way in, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Drop the weapon!

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Love it.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Okay.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:26]** There's a door behind the bartender, and there's another door to the south that looks like it's a transitory door to, like, it's a heavier door.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** It's a different door to a different area.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:33]** Cecil walks in, scans the room, moves around, drops the weapon.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Migo, what are you doing in your suppressor?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:46]** He says, you know, he's actually going to move up right next to the Yusuke at the bar.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Yeah.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** I don't know if you've heard of us, but you really should drop that weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Okay.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Is that an intimidation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Yeah.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Roll an intimidation check.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Are you trying to bully?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** Is that a standard action then?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Because you can't do a move and a standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Let's see what bully is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** It would be considered a standard action if you are actually influencing anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Or demoralize.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** But demoralize is a standard action.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:17]** Bully doesn't... It's just you can intimidate a creature over like...

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** 10 minutes or something like that.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** You must have one minute conversing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** To change attitudes.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** I guess it's just flavor.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Just flavor.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** Fair enough.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Okay.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Just flavor.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Intimidating flavor.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Okay.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** I like it.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** I like it.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Okay.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** It is the top of round one.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** It is that guard's turn.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:43]** As you're walking up, their hand comes out.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** and you're walking up next to them, and you say that, and they, boom, take a shot at you, you get an AOL on them.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Yes, I do.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** Because it is round one as they're taking a shot at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Is that true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Yes, because I've taken an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:57]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** In this combat, I get an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** Yeah, you did take an action in a surprise round.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** What do you do?

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You're going to crit again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** Light him on fire?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** I'm going to swing my hammer.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** That is a 14 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** Hammer time.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** 14 to hit.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** That is going to be a hit.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Kinetic.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** Finder confirmed that he agrees that you get a reaction.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Okay.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Thank you, Finder.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** Thank you, Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:50]** um that is one bludgeoning plus seven electric damage yikes yes wow cool yeah they look hella hurt uh i absolutely think that they are going to fire at you and we'll see what happens

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:56]** Survey says that they get a 22 against EAC on you.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** That hits.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:03]** Even though it seems like your hit knocked them almost the fuck out.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** Just the way that their gun was, the timing, they definitely got a hit on you.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** And that's six points of electricity damage.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:16]** I feel like it goes kind of into your chest shoulder area because they were trying to pull their gun and you walked in.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:22]** And so they couldn't get quite a good shot on you, but it was just so close that, boom, six electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:45]** okay hang on cara yeah well i'm trying to figure something out here what are you trying to figure out so i'm an evolutionist yeah each so like i accumulate mutation points you gain one mutation point at the start of your turn does that include my actions during a surprise round or now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** I would think so.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** It was your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Cool.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:59]** Then I'm going to use something called Avenging Burst, which is when I am damaged by a creature within 10 feet.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:12]** The creature takes 1d4 plus or 1d4 times one half my 1d4 electricity and fire damage for every two evolutionist levels I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Again, the fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Yeah.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Okay.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** All right.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:20]** To vent lethal plasma through the wound to damage your attacker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** So let's do 1d4.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** Okay.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Let's do 1d4.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** That's a two.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Uh-huh.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Nice ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Yeah.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** They get a reflex save, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** What's the DC?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** That's what I'm looking for.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** And is it DC for half?

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Yes.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Just going to knock him out.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Okay.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** They got a 17.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** So take one point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** So like a reflex save?

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Where would I find the safe DC though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** It's a good question.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:17]** hmm let's see what's the avenging burst 10 plus one half class level plus main modifier probably what's the yeah probably okay 10 plus one half your class level which is for us that's 12 what's your uh what's your like key ability score as a as evolution so three

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** So 15, TC 15.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** So they beat it.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Class level, not character level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:25]** So that would be three you have down to one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Yeah, so that's one.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** That's one damage.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** So they take one damage.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:31]** They are barely up.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** barely up as this gets on them.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** Their hand, I'm going to say drops the gun.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** They are like, cause it was right.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Like their, like their gun was like in your body.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Cause you stepped up to the seat next to them.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** And I'm going to narratively say that they dropped the gun.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:51]** Cause it spurts right out of their hand and they dropped the gun as they are almost at death's door.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Well done me go.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Good stuff.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Good stuff.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Cara, what are you doing?

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** You're still around the corner in the lounge.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:58]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** What do you do?

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:08]** Kara's going to walk in, take a few steps towards the Yasuki and out kind of fanning.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Smart.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** She says, comply immediately.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:17]** And she fires her compliance ray.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Ooh.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** And that is 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** That is a hit.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Yeah.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** How much damage did you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Four points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** Four points.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** They slump over onto the bar.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** They're unconscious.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** The threat seems to be over for a second.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** But... You wait.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** The bartender actually reaches over and puts their hand and checks their pulse.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:51]** And the shoki is still alive because that was not lethal with the compliance rate, right?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:02]** The bartender just puts their hands on their face.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Thank you.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** I don't... Thank you.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Thank you so much.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Sorry.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** This has been the worst hour of my life.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** He just wouldn't stop talking.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** He wouldn't stop talking about Digimon and Pokemon.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** I couldn't handle it.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** It's too much.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:30]** I kept asking people what my favorite Pokemon was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:41]** I never played ever, and I didn't know what to say, so I made up names, and I pretended like they were from new games that hadn't released yet, and that I was somehow a game insider.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** It was the worst.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** Okay.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Thank you.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** My...

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** My name is Rose.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Who do I have to thank?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** We're stars.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** We're here for Leon Huxley.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** What's it called?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Sense motive.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** Liara Huxley.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Yeah.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Where can we find her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** I don't know.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** I don't know anything.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:14]** This integrated future face front person was nice.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Look, I'm glad they're not dead.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** I don't think that they meant to shoot.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Maybe it was just a reaction.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** I think that I could have been able to talk him into complying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:27]** They had a gun displayed on the bar earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Yeah.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Yeah.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** What was that about?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** What did he tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** Look, he just came in and I was just prepping.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:41]** I was told that I was supposed to prep for some executives who were going to come in.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:46]** Then suddenly this Yusuke came in and

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** Started shouting at me, waving their gun, telling me that I needed to give up anything.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** And I've got a gun here.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** I've got a gun here.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:57]** And she points, Kara, because you started to move around the bar probably to take control of the situation.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** There's a gun here.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** There's a tactical azimuth laser pistol here.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** It's for safety.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** It's in the back.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** The safety's on.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** And she points under the bar.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** And maybe you walk over.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** You can see that there's something strapped with a quick release.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:13]** Look, I... I... I...

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I'm not an idiot.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** I thought maybe I could just entice them into a drink.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:26]** They seemed like they were maybe a little upset that they weren't in the main party that was taking these executives hostage.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** So I thought, why not?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Maybe I can just make friends.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:35]** So it took a little bit of talking, but they came to the bar and I made them a drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** I know what Stockholm's can do to people.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** I don't know about that.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:45]** I just was trying to play smart and maybe take him off guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:53]** Boom's eyes narrow and he draws in on the cigar and then he tries to sense motive but rolls an eight.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** So then just kind of nods and smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** Can Kara detect any deception in her voice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Give me a sense motive, Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** That is a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:08]** There's a part of you that

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:13]** Rose reminds you maybe of your mom a little bit.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Who was a liar.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Not in that way.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:23]** More like you know that your mom, maybe they're shooting up right now.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:27]** But there are times when they are truly trying to get better.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** And the desperation in her voice is genuine.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:36]** She was truly trying to navigate her way out of a dangerous situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** I got deep real fast.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** Maybe she was able to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** Maybe she was on to something.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** This Yusuke is still alive for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:54]** So Cecil is going to slap binders on the Yosuke who's slumped over in the chair and take his gun and slide it away.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:00]** And then he's going to look at the bartender and say, is there any details you could tell us about this main party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:05]** I haven't seen any of them that this agent would have known.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:26]** they said that their that their name was clive but i can we should we should we bother to rouse this ruffian i don't think i think my check is i uh maybe let's see if he's got a data pad or something on him so let me go data pad go check the body there is a laptop up here i'm going to check it we


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:35]** Boom walks into the lounge and besides noticing the laptop, also notices a box of very expensive cigars that's unopened.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Wait, on the coffee table there?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Yeah, there's a very expensive cigar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Boom takes it right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:48]** Boom, there's no time to pillage for your personal stores.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:53]** What's in this room back here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:01]** Behind me, that's just storage, and there's some mechanical equipment in there, and there's drinks and ingredients.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Here, let me... I can open it for you.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** And she steps back very slowly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Cecil draws his gun up as she does that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** It's a key card.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** It's a key card, I swear.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I swear.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:38]** and just where i keep all my space heroin the door opens you see graded metal floors clearly a back area back room storage space car is gonna go up to the door and do her uh to clear it and does she this other door does she sense anything behind that with uh electro location no no

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:46]** No, what you do sense is a constant maybe, because I'm imagining that your electrolocation has somewhat to do with like the vibrations in the area.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** You're sensing a constant vibration.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:56]** And I think you know enough engineering to know that as you open the door, you walk in, it confirms what you think.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** It's machinery that's operating at a set frequency.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** So you're like, okay, there's nothing in here.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** It's not masking anything.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** I don't see anything.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** It's just some HVAC equipment.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:25]** and the there is a spill in the back area um but otherwise it's just storage you don't see anything in there um what do i find on glass you find a uh you would need a computer check to get in to the data pad um go ahead and give me a quick computers 21 it's fine

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:41]** You look and see that there is enough information to note that one, Clive was asked to be at this place on the ground level about three hours beforehand.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:45]** Show up at this location.

**[00:57:46 - 00:58:06]** clearly showed up any details that he asked for the understanding there is that he is playing support it's very clear that there's an overall mission to take leora huxley hostage that's all that you can get from it seems to corroborate rose's story that clive is

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:31]** bummed let's say that uh they're not part of the main party that is taking out or you know going to extract leora take her hostage which way to the residence section uh uh it's out this door points to the lobby and and to the right copy thanks

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:36]** There is a door down to the south area in the bar that you're at now.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** While this was happening... But she didn't point there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** While this was happening, there's like a computer and two data pads in here.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** You do some checks.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** There's not anything on them.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** They seem like they're new devices that are just set up with IT.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:58]** He comes away with a fresh pack of cigars and comes back to join the group.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** Kara walks out of the storage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Is everything going to be okay?

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** Can I help in any way?

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** I'm going to put my hands down because she's not doing that.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** She's a little more cool and collected seeing that you guys are saving her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** What's the quickest way into the main residence?

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:18]** Just like I said, out this door into the main lobby and to the right.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** What's the quickest way if you don't want to be seen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:46]** that's the quickest way it's actually going to go directly into i believe it's into the office i haven't been there but that's kind of what i hear you know okay so it's through this door yeah through the upper door through the door that uh that boom and cecil breached through and through the door south in that lobby area what is this door to the south of carl

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:49]** That just goes back to more mechanical rooms.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:54]** I went back there to try and store a few extra things that just didn't make sense to put in the back room.

**[00:59:54 - 01:00:00]** But that just goes to more mechanical, you know, like air conditioning and things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** Migo is going to verify that.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Migo, you walk through.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** This is the point where I say this is beyond the scope of this adventure.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** There is not a map for this.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:11]** You walk through.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]** And you walk into a very concrete, exposed ceiling, empty back room.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Looks like double doors.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:24]** Clearly not at all meant for anybody to go through.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:28]** It's just an easy access area that the architect was like, put it somewhere.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]** Architect was like, I'm going to draw that on the map.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** We don't need plans for that.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** No one needs plans for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:42]** Cecil's going to tell Rose just head out to the helipad and there'll be somebody to take care of you soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:43]** Oh, wow.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:44]** Okay.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:44]** Thanks.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Thanks.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** It's best you get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:48 - 01:01:18]** okay what about um what about clive we'll be back to him is he gonna be okay oh okay all right he'll have to pay for his crimes yeah no definitely okay all right here i go up through the lounge bye see you she walks out we we bound him right yeah yeah he's he's still dead he is he is bound he's bindered that's the technical term all right stack up get ready


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:30]** okay i got my pulse caster because i expect well yeah how big is this room do we know can we since can i roll perception on the door since anything through it unless you can see through doors no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:57]** and this room across from where car is standing now that was the that was like more uh more mep you can open it and see you you also got a constant hum in there as well you open it you walk in seems like electrical equipment generators could we cut the lights to the building you could probably cut the lights the building but since this is the main electrical area you're probably going to cut all the electricity to the building

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** which would include literally everything like doors.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** You could.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:06]** It would involve shooting the generator.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** I don't know that you want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** The hand dryers.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** The air handling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Everything.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** Literally everything.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** Yeah.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** You couldn't wash your hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** Nothing.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:16]** So we don't know what's beyond this door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:24]** This seems to be the entrance to the residential area, and from what Rose said, to the office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:28]** Okay, wasn't there some other, like a data room on this floor?

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** I don't remember anything about that, was there, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:52]** yeah uh who's this junk uh you remember that that boom you walked up to the right when you were investigating the security you almost went in there that was a data room which if you should we check that out before we before we move along yes always good happy for data in here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** No, this is... What is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** No, that's the electrical room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** Be quick about it.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** I would know that because I know these things.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Of course you do.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** I'm going to tell you right now.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Yep.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** You start walking over to the data room.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:37]** you're able to get in server racks racks on racks on racks racks on racks on racks you think this would also be a good place for a micro tap if you were able to tap here this is where everything's like this is the spine switch this is where this is where all the data is coming to then it's going out somewhere else so there was going to be a tap this would have been a good spot for a tap this would have been a good place to go ahead and yeah car you still got that data tap yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:37 - 01:04:05]** always i think we might have hit the jackpot with this one all right so i can do a successful engineering check to place a tap um yeah give me a dc what was it 17 18 this might be the time to use arty archie how dare you get my name wrong and we'll figure it out okay so what's your engineering check car and what are you trying to do with archie


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]** Does Archie assist or does anyone assist?

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** That was a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** Okay.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** Archie does a plus two for perception and attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Not for engineering.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** Oh, it's not for engineering?

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Nope.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Okay.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:24]** I actually got a 17, but it was dirty with an assist, so an 18.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:25]** That's fine.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:26]** Yeah, I like it.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:33]** You're able to find the switch, plug it in, takes 10 minutes, couple of terminal commands, set up, you're good.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:34]** You're set.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** you now have a micro-tap on all the data coming in.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:44]** I'm going to say that that's probably going to be limited to thinking about where the server would be.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:48]** It's going to be your cameras and what else?

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:55]** Probably if there are any doors that are opening, I'm going to assume that door openings are collected in data there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** Oh, we see the camera so we can see the residential area that we'll be going into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:07]** There is not a camera in the residential area here that you can see.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:11]** So that must be in a different area.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:19]** Now, if you want to use Archie at the door to the residential area, to the home office, you could.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** So what are you all doing right now?

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:22]** Talk to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Yeah, I suggest we do that.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:25]** Whatever he just said.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:26]** Who?

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:30]** You said using Archie at the door to the home office?

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** Sorry, were you suggesting that I should use Archie?

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** main office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:43]** I'm unclear why there seems to be so much confusion about a residential home next to a place of business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:47]** I have a home office.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:51]** It's not the same thing as a residence in an office building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** It's just what we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:57]** My office does not have a bar attached to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:00]** Are any of you executives?

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:00]** Just kidding.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** That's true.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** She is really rich and stuff.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** Yeah, she is really rich.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:09]** I do often wonder about the intelligence test of our recruits.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** Joke.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** Mostly Cecil.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:21]** Okay, so Archie comes up and comes in behind you.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:43]** i kind of picture the the same like sounds as ghost from destiny and comes up and aids whoever is doing the perception check at the door which i think is cecil cecil's the breacher the newbie uh is anybody else aiding besides archie certainly it's real bad um okay so boom aids


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:44 - 01:07:11]** boom aids the boom plus three plus two is 10 10 plus what does archie give me plus two it's 12 12 it's not very good yeah you can't tell anything through the door uh so well boom has uh his nanite ability is that he can put down like a seismic coupler and i think it can like detect sort of things interesting so talk to me about this talk to me about this

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:20]** At the risk of making a 10-minute rules conversation, it's basically like a tactic seismic coupler.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:24]** It's a spherical device resembling a grenade with six spikes, blah, blah, blah.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:35]** Basically, upon landing, it sends near-surface seismic data back to a personal comm unit or a data pad within 100 feet that you're carrying, giving you senses.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:38]** listed for each model while you were within the model's listed radius.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** I don't know what the fuck that means.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:45]** But they compare it to... They're just like, it's like a drone camera and magical scrying is what it's compared to.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** It's an item?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** It's an item.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:56]** So it's a little like electrolocation, which I don't know, Cara, how much, what the duration on electrolocation is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** It's until you dismiss it.

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:58]** Rad.

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** Cool.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:03]** But I had to dismiss it in order to install a tap.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** Copy.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:05]** There we go.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]** Also, thanks for keeping true to that.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:08]** Appreciate that.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:14]** Okay, so Kara has used the electrolocation, so do you want to deploy your seismic activity?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** Will it be helpful in light of that?

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:21]** Sorry, I was reading something on a... I get the sense it's a little like the electrolocation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** But that one is not currently being used, correct?

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Because it's been dispersed.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Okay, then I will use it.

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:18]** two things you put down this you're pulling out the legs of this device put it down at cecil's feet as you do you put it down and you hear a ping sounds a little longer than you think you're like huh i wonder what's under this floor and then you remember this is the pit trap that was

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:46]** this is where the pit trap was that we disabled right under the floor you feel it feels like this is on a this is related to the door as soon as you hit the control panel the floor would slide out and anybody standing there ready to go would just fall down can't see it you didn't open it it sounds like this there's a hollow space beneath this floor panel


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:52]** Man, if this were not disabled, Cecil would take another very bad fall, unfortunately.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:55]** But we're safe.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:58]** Do I sense anything on the other side of the door?

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:20]** You get another constant hum, but the weird thing is that you're like, I know there's mechanical equipment off to the right, but right beyond this space, there's some unusual signal beyond here.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:41]** and i can't detect what that is can't no not not quite sure you're you're looking at like the frequency of this come in it's like when you play a tone and you're watching the frequency of it you're like cool that is directly at 40 hertz but you're like okay it's not at 60 hertz so it's not a fan it's not at like you know uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:46]** Because every time I see something that's rolling at 60 hertz, I'm like, that's definitely a fan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:47]** That's definitely a fan.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:52]** It's not at any hertz that it's related to, like the electricity that you might know here, right?

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:54]** It's at kind of an unusual frequency.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:55]** You're like, this is a one-off thing.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** This is interesting.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Yeah.

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:04]** Also, comms come in through Archie.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** Hey, this is Commando Bolt.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:13]** I'm getting a reading on Leora's emergency beacon.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:20]** Seems like it's coming from the residence, but it looks like you all are about to breach in.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:23]** Just FYI, keep an eye out.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:34]** Somehow, it seems like the emergency beacon is going into the cliff below where you're at.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** Uh-oh.
