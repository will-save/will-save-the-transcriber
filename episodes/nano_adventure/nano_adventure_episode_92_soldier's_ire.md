## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:36 - 00:02:01]** naturalist gm you know because you're running a museum or like like who knows why you have no clothes on is that why i have my what no clothes on yeah that's it that's it oh is that what you mean i just thought that i would just be like all right cool yeah that's fine this is why you have to be on that's why you have to watch our videos so you can see john without a shirt yeah you got your audio only people are missing out yeah i feel like for those of us that know him it looks remarkably similar to john wearing a shirt


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** I know, yeah, it looks exactly the same.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** I mean, I'm wearing a shirt over my sweater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** He had a huge accident when he was younger.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Now his body is just covered in hair.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** It's just hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** It's tarred in hair.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** The tar is permanent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** We were talking about being dinosaurs.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** You were, like, submerged in tar for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Yeah, I definitely was.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** And then I came out.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** That's why I really prefer the hot tub streams.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:25]** I think we should start doing our streams all in a hot tub so we can get the hot tub tag.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** But it's just us still playing Starfinder in the hot tub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** Let's do it.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** We can just... Cool.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Well, we can take this off air.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** What?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** But yeah, there's... Okay.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** You can hot tub it.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** We forgot to hot tub it last time, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** We did.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** We did.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:40]** Yeah, I definitely was very much looking forward to that.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** But we'll do it next time.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** It's plenty of time.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** My question for you this week is...

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** Do you remember your character's voice from last time?

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** Because we recorded several weeks ago.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** I think so.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Yeah?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** I mean, Boone's voice is pretty iconic.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** I like... Oh, yeah?

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** What does it sound like?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** I think Remy makes sense.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Yeah.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** I think Kara.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:07]** Like, I can still hear each of your characters' voices, partly because I just edited the episode.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** But, like...

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** I have no idea what Migo sounds like.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:21]** I was trying to pull up my recording from last time to listen to it while we were getting steady and just couldn't get there quick enough.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** So, you know, we'll do it live.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** That's what we do, right?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** We'll just hit it live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** We'll hit it live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:35]** Maybe there's some backstory damage to his vocal processing unit and his accent changes every episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** It wouldn't be the first time that we have done something.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** We have done shipping accidents.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Of that sort.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:46]** I did look up Commander Boltz because I was like, I don't remember what I had for her.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** Literally right before we started.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** So it's good.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:54]** As long as you don't turn into like a Western oil baron all of a sudden, I think we'll be okay.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** Wait, who did this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Is this a shout out to a past gentleman?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** My lord, look at all this damage.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** My head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** Heat in Savannah.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** It's just.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Are we talking like Daniel Day?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** My boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** My boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** My boy.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** My boy.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** All right.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** I want to get started.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** I want to play.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** We all down?

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Yeah.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Cool.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Let's talk about trucks.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** No foreplay.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Just right in there.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** What about trucks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:33]** Well, I was going to preface it with if you're a real truck person, I suggest you skip ahead.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:41]** But like my wife and I only have one car and I'm looking for a new vehicle and I've kind of fallen in love with the Ford Maverick.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** If you guys don't know what that is, it's a very little truck.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** But it comes in hybrid.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** It's a four-wheel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** It's this generation's Ranger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Yeah.

**[00:04:51 - 00:05:15]** well the ranger actually still exists and it's a mid-size now yeah but yeah like i i grew up with with small trucks my my first truck was a nissan xe uh that thing probably weighed a thousand pounds uh my my dad drove a mishabishi mighty max uh which single cab you know it was just a bed an engine and a cab and then the uh you remember the mazda b series


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Oh, yeah, I think it's tiny.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Tiny.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:25]** It had a five-speed transmission, and you could, like, if you were getting after it, go straight from one to three to five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:37]** So yeah, I grew up with those kind of trucks, and my dad always collected Rancheros, and there was also the Rampage, which were all like the El Camino style small car slash trucks.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:47]** So my buddy actually worked on the Maverick when they released a couple years ago, and I've just been looking at new vehicles, and I keep coming back to it.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** I'm really in love with it.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:56]** The saddest part is I went to test drive one, and there was a safety recall, so I couldn't even test drive them.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:02]** To be fair, the second call was like a blinker thing, like something to do with the emergency flashers.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** And like, yeah, I get it.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** It's a stand down because the flashers aren't working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** It's not like a flint bumper kind of recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** It's not like a tire is going to fall off or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Yeah.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** Or, you know, spontaneously catches fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Yeah, that wasn't one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** Small trucks are where it's at, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:23]** But I did get to test drive the F-150 Lightning, which was dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** If I had 90 grand to just throw in a vehicle.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** You're just going to leave us on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Yeah, well.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Kelly?

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:54]** ford ford is as far as american brands go it's kind of like i think the best one probably in terms of reliability so you'll be you'll probably be in pretty good hands too and uh what's that really small japanese 150 we still have f-150 that same f-150 from like 1994 so that it works out um uh will and i are getting k trucks from japan that's what we're getting oh uh see you

**[00:06:54 - 00:07:21]** yeah totally we discussed it two years ago what brain yeah totally i don't know who makes them i think it's like every japanese car makes like a tiny truck if it got hit by like a job or it would explode or whatever but like kei trucks they're the bed's actually quite big it's as big as many trucks you're talking like the little like utility it's just like a flat flat nose like yeah yeah but the bed itself is really cool and it all sides fold down so it's like kind of dope um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:47]** it's a it's a pretty i feel like a lot of good social media videos about it too okay can i ask what is it that you're wearing like right now yeah that i see on your head yeah buddy a pattern designed by it looks like not only you're wearing it it's like it's like it's behind it's become part of your i didn't know your chair was also what's going on with that you know it's yeah

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:39]** Be sure to use the coupon, though, if you're going to order that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** Definitely use the coupon.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:48]** The problem with you left-handed people is that it's more expensive to manufacture your **** just because you're you and there's less of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** We have to spend a lot more time and resources in R&D.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** Because it's a variant.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** There's a different stress with the left hand, right?

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** The way that the stresses are moving throughout the cup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:07]** We're also going to make a completely pink version, and then it's going to be twice as much as the normal one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** That's what you've got to get if you want the pink text.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:15]** I thought that was going to be 65% less than the non-pink one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** It could be that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:23]** We are truly benevolent podcast creators in that we gave you a left-handed mug, so you're welcome.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Nick brought lots in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** Yeah, so that's good.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** We can cut this.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** No one knows.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** It's not his tag on Discord, though.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** You know who you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** That's why I just wanted to say thanks.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** That was it.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Thank you.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Thank you.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Just a general thanks.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:12]** And thanks to everybody who supported on our coffee, which is also on the mugs that we have here.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** We really appreciate y'all.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** Yeah.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** We do.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** You're appreciated.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** You are just in the universe.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** You're appreciated.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:22]** If you're wondering, if you're thinking about it, you're like, does anybody appreciate me?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** We'll save this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** We do.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Yeah.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** We appreciate you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:33]** And if you're feeling underappreciated, head to our coffee, support us, and you'll have five hugely appreciative humans to lean on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** Yeah, we'll appreciate you even more, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** It's cheaper than therapy, but it's almost there.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** I'm not anyone's therapist.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Sorry, world.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** You don't want that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** That could be a tear.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Throw around some unreasonable requests for me.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** That's a request for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** That's an unreasonable request.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** Somebody asked if we could make an unreasonable request channel, and I made it.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** And it's there.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** It's locked behind a paywall.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** You've got to do the coffee together, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:17]** So far, we've got two absolutely unreasonable requests.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Very unreasonable.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** What are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Okay.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Let's take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** You have to find out.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** You've got to find out.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** You've got to find out.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** I'll read one, and then you've got to find out.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** I don't even want you to do this.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Adam from Strange Table Fellows.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** Vinny, please do the entire next episode standing on your head.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Can't confirm.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** I'm seeing you not on your head, so.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Not on my head.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Yeah.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** Although the audio listeners would have no idea.

**[00:11:47 - 00:12:07]** super flushed it's upside down the other one I would never ever imagine trying to do but you gotta join our coffee to see what it is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Yeah, that's also a really good one.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Okay, this is more doable than the other one, though.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** It's just really inconvenient.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** I don't think it is.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** I genuinely don't think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Could you imagine doing that?

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Imagine doing that for an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Yeah, I would just do it less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** You know what I mean?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** Also, let's be real.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:31]** The quality from one to another is really going to depend.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** It's just not good.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** It's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** Legit, I do think it's a fun thing to do.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** Would I have to have an assortment to rotate into?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:45]** Or is it just one type that I've got to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:45 - 00:13:08]** yeah you'd have to get you can get multiple of the same type but it's very specific you know what i mean right yeah i'm sorry all right well i'm just curious why would you ever do that with that item right it sounds very specific you could die doing it couldn't you i feel like it's not as easy as if you're doing it with something like a little bit less viscous i suppose maybe you could die the whole being able to breathe is kind of a problem yeah that's hard


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:24]** stuff would get tired good luck yeah we'll figure it out yeah thanks Jeremy you're the best the sweetest kindest all right I'm still giving Jeremy the IPC when we do a live show oh yeah of course very cool with that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Let's play.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Let's go back a little bit.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** John, you sneaky, sneaky man.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** I feel like something has to be said eventually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Oh, it will.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** I'm going to say something because I don't even know where to start.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:43]** Hold your tongue there, young Gilliam.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Why do I have... Oh, my God.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** So, look, you have... You have...

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:56]** Started the nano venture as we have, as I've made the revision to call it from mini venture.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:07]** You all are part of the special tactics and raid squadron in the city of Morrow on the planet of Akiton in the packed worlds in the game Starfinder.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** You all.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** have taken nanites in order to join this special crew.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:24]** And since you all took that final injection of nanites, you've had a banner year for stars in doing incredible deeds.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** And we'll get into that later in saving people.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Again, we'll get into that later.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:40]** And we started off two episodes ago with you being honored at the Rings for Life charity auction at the Morrow Museum of History.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** set up again by Ringworks Industries.

**[00:14:44 - 00:15:03]** And as you were hearing about, just as the whole thing was getting started from the outreach coordinator and then from the CEO of the local office, Lior Huxley, Lior Huxley was set at gunpoint, taken off screen, screen cut out.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:07]** As you were then attacked by...

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:12]** Three armed individuals and a small dinosaur.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** Gunshots started to ring out.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** The place evacuated.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:29]** And during this first round, I want to say that our friendly, fellow, caring, gregarious boom knocked over and destroyed a priceless artifact and fossil.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** What?

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** I don't remember that.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Yeah.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:35]** So and then Cecil was trying to play it smart.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Didn't shoot.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:40]** Trying to take clear view of the situation.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** Kara smartly moved quickly disarmed.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:51]** I think that might be like the first time that we actually successfully used a maneuver there.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** So that was incredible.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:55]** That was like the first thing out of the gate disarmed.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** Beautiful.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Beautiful.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:20]** and then also use uh your one of your nano set abilities to reduce the damage miko just bossed it like henry cavill in that one movie just like came out swinging turned his evolutionist arm into a hammer when he like locks locks his fists yeah it was super cool impossible movies yeah it was great it was great

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:25]** He reloads his arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:31]** And then at the end of the round, we ended with...

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:37]** Kara hears a voice in her head saying, you aren't supposed to move yet.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** And, Kara, I said that you need to make a will save.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** I'm sure we've been waiting.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** You've been waiting.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** It's been in the back of your mind.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** You've been waking up in cold sweats.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** You've been, like, worried, thinking about it.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** You talked to me about it nonstop when I saw you over New Year's.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** You just couldn't keep asking.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** I couldn't get it out of my head at all.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** Yeah, yeah, just really got in there.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:05]** So I'm going to need you to make a we'll save, and I will tell you what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** We'll save!

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** We'll save!

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** We'll save!

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** That was so delayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** We'll cut it up, make it sound better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** It sounds really too early.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** And you need to make it.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** It's like way too early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** I rolled a 14 for an 18 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** For an 18 total.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** You're standing there.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:33]** You feel this overwhelming sense with those words in your head.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** that you almost want to just turn around.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:48]** Your muscles almost feel compelled to turn around, and then your iron will shakes it off as you pass the will save from the command spell that didn't take effect as DC 16.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Well done.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** Way to be safe.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** You would have been subject to the approach choice from the command spell.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Yeah.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Sorry for the interruption.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Hello, Mrs. Decker.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Goodbye, Mrs. Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** Hello, and that was her Twitch debut, everyone.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** Say hello.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Woo, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Good times, good times.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** Alright, we are back in combat.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:21]** I am going to go ahead and it's going to start at the top of the next round.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Is the map loaded for anyone?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** It is loaded now.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** There it is.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Got it.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** Your friendly neighborhood map.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:44]** And as that happens, at the top of the round, you all are standing there, and Cara, right as you feel that happened, let's see, who would see this?

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:54]** Probably Cecil and Migo might see this, but you hear the sounds of, I'm coming!

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:54]** I'm coming!

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** I'm coming!

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** I'm coming!

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:12]** And Commander Bolt runs into the room, and Commander Bolt immediately looks around, surveys to see what is going on, and is going to run up to King Kara and take a shot.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:21]** Runs across past the giant wreckage there of some long-forgotten ship.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:29]** That is going to be a hit as this small gun comes out with these fiery red rings on it.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:36]** And she fires a tactical ring fire.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** That is going to be 1d8 plus 6.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** Got a 6.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:50]** That's 12 points of damage to Kinkara from the side as Commander Bolt comes to join in the battle after evacuating everybody.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** So you got somebody on your side.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:58]** We got the dinosaur's turn here.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** And I love this dinosaur.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** They're so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Where is this dinosaur?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** I love him.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** He's like to the northwest of Boone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:33]** yeah yeah it's just below the big dinosaur on our side the dinosaur is not on your side the dinosaur is you see this like this rage of red seem to just come up from the dinosaur's legs all the way up to and there's like a slight red sheen around the dinosaur you will uh

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:57]** what you will find out what that does soon i have a request yeah please like bring the dinosaur back up on screen so we can see him in all of his glory because i forgot oh yeah of course yeah of course let me see if i can uh yeah can i i don't know that i can do that uh yeah let's was that the dinosaur's full turn it's just full move act or full action to make them bread

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:21]** it's kind of funny for a dinosaur i feel like they're really like especially ones that look like that are usually like fast and can do a lot really quickly so okay well well because you said that it runs up to you and pass the uh the there it still is going to stay red but it does run up to you all right there's a distinct lack of dinosaur on the screen though that's what i'm saying i can't see him like where is he


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** I mean, I want to see like him.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I'm sorry.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Can you pop him up on screen?

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Because I want to see the full image.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** That's what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Right.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** I know.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** I can't.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Right.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Go ahead.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** Sorry, buddy.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:37]** You need to actually go ahead and give me a fortitude saving throw there.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Boom.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** Oh, man.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** All right.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** Well, he's going to have a plus five because he thinks dinosaurs are cool.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Okay.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Love it.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** That will help him psychologically.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Yeah.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Actually, it's a plus five anyway at 42.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** Okay.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** We'll just say that works out.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** And then it's a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Yeah.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** It's a 20.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Okay, cool.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:12]** You are good to go as that red starts to move up your body and just dissipates as it tries to cast Destructive Rebuke on you, which is a super cool spell that I'm 0 for 2 now on spells getting through.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** Got that saver suck there.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** Right behind Commander Bolt, actually from the next hallway down below.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:24]** There is the sound of footsteps as one of the security guards runs back in.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:37]** And that guard is going to run straight ahead, seeing this dinosaur attacking U-Boom, and is going to take a shot off with a needler pistol.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** That is absolutely going to hit.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Almost a crit.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** That was a 19.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:46]** And that's going to be four points of damage to the dinosaur.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** And it is Kara Valtara's turn.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** What are you doing, Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:01]** Kara is going to having... So the person in gold was the one that spoke this.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:11]** The person who spoke that is actually the woman that Commander Bolt attacked.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Down where?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Up in the top left.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Left side?

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Yeah.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** The woman dressed in all black, or the Lashunta dressed in all black with the cool eyepiece.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** And this person in front of me is just disarmed.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** Was just disarmed and then had a knife and stabbed you.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** if you recall from the last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** Sorry, the person in gold, just to the right of the skeleton, that is an enemy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Yes, that's also an enemy combatant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** You said there were four.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** So one, two, three...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** There's one down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** I think I dispatched one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Oh, is that one dead?

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** The one down at the bottom?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** No.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Maybe I didn't.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** There's four total.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** There's a dinosaur, there's two, and then there's three people.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** So I don't know where you heard four.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** But what are you going to do, Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:09]** Yeah, Kara is going to attempt to trip with her tack lash the foe in front of her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:38]** all right love it love it what's the what's the dc for trip so it's 25 but i get a um i get bonuses with the uh with your role okay awesome just pulling it up okay sounds good so you whip out that tack lash and you're just like you know what just you've got to complete the like full indiana jones first you like knock the pistol out of the hand and then now you just gotta i'm sweeping back

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** Sweeping the leg.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Yeah, to sweep the leg.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Sweeping the leg.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** Okay.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Sweep it.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Sweep it, babe.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** It's a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Really, mix and reference.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** It's a natural one.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** It's a what?

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Oh, God.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** All right.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** Yeah.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** What happens with the natural one?

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** On a combat, maybe we punch the failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Let's see.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Are you not doing the conditions tech?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Yeah, the critical fumble.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** I got it right here.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Ah-ha-ha.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Yeah, ah-ha-ha.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:18]** Kev, maybe you were referring to the fact that there's one combatant over on the left side, the female Lashunta, and then there are three combatants.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:23]** There's one in yellow, one next to Migo, and then one next to Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Right.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** In your intro, you said there were three plus a dinosaur.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** I misspoke.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** But there are four plus a dinosaur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** This is my first time doing a whole group, Kev.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** There are a total of five enemies currently, correct?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Get off my butt, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** I'm just trying to do a game.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:43]** Can't just exclude dinosaurs and be a species like that, you know what I mean?

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:43]** Wow.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** Kevin literally has one behind him.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** That's it.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** That's it.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** That's the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** He's gone.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Where'd he go?

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:49]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** I don't want Kevin to be GM again.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** He's going to fucking multiply the dinosaurs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I'll take it back.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** N plus one dinosaurs.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** You guys see 18 dinosaurs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** All right, well, ready?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Three, two, one.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** I'm going to start going now.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Now.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:10]** Now, he says, that is, the extreme is an extreme blow.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** This was kinetic, right?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Pinched, you take one damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:20]** Okay, so she swings the tactical lash.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:24]** And she, like, mistimes it and misses completely.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:32]** But then also the, like, head of the tack lash where you would strike, like, whips back at her arm.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** And she takes it.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** So it, like, kind of hits, like, your back.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** Slaps you.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** I would say, like, upper, you know, arm.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Upper arm.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Okay, cool.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Love it.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Love it, love it, love it.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Okay.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** I think that's my turn.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** That's your old turn.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Okay, sounds good.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** It is.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:57]** There's another security guard that appears right behind...

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:11]** And right next to Miko, out of that hallway, on the other side of the museum, comes out and just immediately walks up with the same tactical needler rifle, fires at the assailant right in front of you.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** That is, again, almost a crit.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:19]** I'm rolling real well with your allies and not real well with your...

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** enemies, which is a bummer.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:30]** Three points of damage as these needles just fire into the back, and he staggers forward a little bit, bracing himself on the swag table.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** A bunch of swag falls all over the place, so you can take as much as you want, Migo, and nobody will notice.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** I know.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Wild.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** Wild it is!

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:45]** The enemy combatant who is right there in the middle, they are going to run down, I think.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Actually, you know what?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** They're going to stand right there and right in the center.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:54]** They're right next to the giant dinosaur fossil in the middle of the room.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** And they're going to just fire at Cecil because Cecil hasn't done anything.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:00]** So you look like a weak little kitten.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:05]** Kittens aren't weak, but you look like a little kitten to them just waiting to be hit.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** That's a 15 against your EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** That's a miss.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** That's a miss.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** It's because I'm a little, tiny mouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:24]** And it hits a fossil further back in the museum, destroying yet another Price's artifact after Boom destroyed the first one.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** What are you going to do after the salvo comes at you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** First thing he does, he's kind of in the middle between Migo and Boom.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** He's going to turn to Migo and be like, You okay over there, Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Yeah, I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** I'm going to cover Boom.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** And he's going to step up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** I'm also fine.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Thank you for asking.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** And he, like, holds up his hammer hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:55]** But then Cecil is going to take a step kind of... Am I locked?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** I'm locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Oh, pause.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** You're good now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:05]** So he's going to step up just north of Boom, five feet, ten feet north of Boom.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** Yeah.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** But since he has this long pike...

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** He actually has reach.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Don't move, Boom.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** You stay there.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** I'm sorry.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** I thought I was growing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:17]** Boom, you're stepping all over the remnants of whatever fossil is here.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** Stop destroying.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** I hate dinosaurs.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** No.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** So he's going to attack the dinosaurs.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Wow.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Okay.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Rude.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Yeah, do it though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:28]** That's a 14 plus 6 to hit.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** So 20 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:33]** That's a 14 plus 6 to attack the dinosaur.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:38]** And that is going to be a hit for sure.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** All right.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** And I got this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** D8 plus 7.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:48]** 4 plus 7 for 11 points of damage.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** So he just kind of steps up next to Boom.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** Looks like there's a table or chair or something between us.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Okay.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** And he's just going to slice right at the body of this creature.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** I need you to make a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** What?

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** That's 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** 14 total.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** It's DC 14.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** You passed.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:26]** As you stab through it, the destructive rebuke is cast as a reaction, and you could have taken damage from it, but because your hit kills the dinosaur.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** What?

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** No.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Oh.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:32]** Instead, that red light starts to come up and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:32 - 00:31:00]** fades away as the dinosaur falls over and joins its brethren in the museum dead enemy neutralized we will put you on display dead friend boom it's your turn what are you doing boom was getting ready to do some but uh now he's freed up to do some other so this uh this black sort of figure to the uh east is an enemy right so yeah they're they are looking not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:21]** good they're the ones standing over the swag being like maybe i should have just come to this event as a participant and not an assailant because the swag is cool okay got you yeah i can't really it's a bad life choices classic because me goes nearby yeah all right well i guess stars is in the business of you know changing people's lives we did good work today


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:30]** Boom is going to attack with his squad machine gun because he doesn't want to have splash damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Going to go full auto and just hit everybody in the room?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Die!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:39]** Just hit all the fossils, all the artifacts, all the swag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:48]** Okay, next time I say to anyone that I'm going to be a soldier, I just want you to remind me to never, ever, ever, ever do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Let's talk about this, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:52]** I know, but I'm a grenadier, basically.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:57]** I can't use grenades with Migo there and stuff, so it's kind of problematic.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** It's almost like we had this conversation.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** I know we did, but I was like, all right, boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** The gun is a side piece.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** I mean, whatever.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** What did you say?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Are you metagaming that you won't get damaged?

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** We made the decision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** We were instructed.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** We were specifically instructed.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Okay.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Let this be clear.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** John, you instructed us to play like a character we had never played like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** I had encouraged you.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** You mean like class-wise?

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Whatever-wise.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** Whatever you want.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** Whatever that means.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** He's a bomb and grenades guy.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** But I can't do anything right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** He picked a different class.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** What is the character?

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Sorry, I forget what a soldier's...

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** The good thing about Starfinder is that there's a lot of specializations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** So I do appreciate that you're going with this bombardier thing.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I think it's really rad.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** It just might not be rad in this round of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** And that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** That's cool.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** Please warn me next time that I want to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:59]** I just remember a full year of you talking about Soldier.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** So you can breach.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Boom breaches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Boom breaches.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Breach this guy into the next century.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Come on.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:11]** I think an eight is my average roll for soldiers.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** But anyway, go ahead.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I rolled an eight.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** So it's very average for me.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** You rolled an eight to do what?

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** To attack.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** It would have been 11 points of damage, just like Kevin, but alas.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** What are you attacking with?

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Your ire of being a soldier?

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:28]** Yeah, it's the squad machine gun.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** I didn't catch what you said.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** What did you say?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** I'm attacking with my anger?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:43]** Your ire of being a soldier.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** It goes wildly and destroys this beautiful floor.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** Start making me destroy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** Okay, I guess his name is Boomer, so I guess he's kind of asking for it.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** You can just let Boom die and then make a new character.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** It's the first combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Well, you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** Boom probably doesn't give a f*** about this place.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** Suddenly the pins are magically removed from all of his grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:30]** all right it is the uh the agent who is right in front of you cara who is going to try and use that switchblade to once again just get right in there and i can't see in the shadow of my computer that is an 13 against kc which probably doesn't break your armor does not

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Does not.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** Okay.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** All right.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:41]** And then I think they're going to take a five foot step back and give me a perception or an insight, whichever you, or sorry, sense motive.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Actually, give me a sense motive, Cara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I got a, let me look it up.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Sense motive.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** Oh, that crushed.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Crushed.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Crushed with a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Okay.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** Okay.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:04]** Immediately from the way that they move and the way that their eyes looking, they see that the tide is starting to shift ever so slightly.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** They're pretty aware.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** So you can see they're doing some calculus in their head about what my next step should be.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Who knows?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** They might.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** But that is the... They might boom it.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** I don't know.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Migo, it's your turn.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** There's somebody who's almost dead in front of you.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** The dinosaur is dead to your left.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Are the tides changing?

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Are you going to change the tides?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Are you going to non-lethal it?

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** Are you going to skewer him on your cool hammer?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** What are you going to do?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Are you going to take some swag and leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:36]** I think Migo is not one to leave witnesses.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** And so... All right.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:59]** cool i have to know um so like seeing the assailant bent over the swag table amigo like sort of like you would take an axe if you're chopping wood takes his hammer arm and just like right as you're about to bring it down you look up and you see the figure in their eyes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:05]** Everything that their life knew before, they just see it flashing.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** Silhouetted by this hammer approaching their face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:15]** There's like a scene of them with their partner under the covers.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** It's like the white diffused sunlight.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** They're like laughing.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** There's like cats and dogs.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** There's like fun dinners and laughs, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Wait, now you're going for the dinosaur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:29]** Remembering chopping wood out in the wilderness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:51]** I think what happens is that vignette is broken by the sound of thunder crackling and the white light of the electricity rippling off of the hammer as it hits the swag table right in front of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:58]** Cutting the swag table in half and he falls prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Basically.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** That was an 11 to hit.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** I'm pretty sure that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** Well, that's what happens because you missed.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yes.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** He's just standing there confused, covered in lanyards.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** I do think that he falls prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:18]** He definitely falls prone covered in lanyards for this event.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** That his partner said that she wanted to come to.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:23]** And he's like, sorry, you shouldn't go.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** This is a plus one.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** No, this is a plus one.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** This is a work trip.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** I'm going to need you to stay.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** This is a work trip.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Sorry.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** I know you wanted to see his museum.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Next time, babe.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** All right.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Amazing.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** Okay.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** It is their turn.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** And they...

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** I like, this is, this, this couldn't be more clear to me.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** They turn around and they put their arms in front of their chest.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** Like, like they are, they are like, do not, do not hit me.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Please stop, stop, stop, please.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:52]** And you can see the fear in their eyes and, and you hear behind their mask.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Do you show them this?

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** That's all that they're going to do on their turn.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** They're going to stay prone and not do anything.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:09]** I imagine that in the 10 to 15 seconds that have passed, it's now the individual who tried to command you, Kara.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:18]** And in that 10 to 15 seconds, it might be a little quiet, and you might be able to hear the protests of that agent.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:30]** This individual on the top left, the bastard Lashunta, is going to turn around and is going to cast...

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:54]** death's door on commander bolt uh no that's a bad spell and is going to cast it at first level that is a where am i as fortitude save oh no no what okay okay here we go here we go

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** I rolled a four on the die.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Not great.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Not great.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Commander Bolt plus eight to their fortitude.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** It's DC 16.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** They don't make it.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:10]** It's 1d10 plus two strength damage to Commander Bolt.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:19]** That's eight points of damage and two strength damage to Commander Bolt as she turns around and just makes the symbol of a door and then pushes it.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:24]** This ghostly white image floating as it moves through Commander Bolt.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** And that is the end of the round.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** It's Commander Bolt's turn.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:37]** Commander Bolt is absolutely, having taken eight damage and two strength damage, is just going to fire one more time.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:44]** Just hit, stumbles back, tries to clear their eyes and open one eye and fire.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Ooh, that's a five.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** That is actually a 21, so it's going to hit because I forgot that there are ****.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** Forgot that there are ****, so that's cool.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:57]** That's seven more points of damage as this shot grazes their shoulder.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Sorry.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** A lot happening out in the corner of the screen as this one individual is not going to give up.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:17]** The security guard who is over on the left, having seen now that the dinosaur is down, is going to run over... Let's see.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:22]** It's going to move 30 feet up to behind the sign so Cecil, you might see them.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:27]** And they are going to take a shot at the... Let's see.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** They see the one...

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:33]** Agents saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't shoot me.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:40]** They are going to fire at the individual who's still standing up because they have not at all done any actions except to shoot at Cecil.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** I think it's going to be a range increment beyond.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** So they're going to get a minus two to their attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** Who's the person shooting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** The security guard in the bottom left who's come back in now that everyone was evacuated.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** The one that I was highlighting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:00]** Who's the subject of the attack?

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** It is the individual in yellow from the sun.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Oh, it's just yellow?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** It's not gold?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:10]** Well, it's just gold from the last sunlight that's going to hit us here.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** They are...

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** They got that good light, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** Wow, that's 14 points of damage.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** That's good.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** No, sorry.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** That's not 14 points of damage.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** That was a D8.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** I should have rolled with a D6.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:31]** That's only two points of damage, but it does hit them, and they are not feeling good at all.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Kara, it's your turn.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** A lot has happened.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Somebody has given up.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:41]** One individual is still pushing, and the tide is continuing to turn in your favor.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:51]** I'm going to try and not screw up this time tripping this foe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** No, it's only like a 1 in 20 chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** That's okay.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** I have a little bit better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** What did you get?

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** It's a 25 even.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** 25 even.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** That was a 25.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** They trip and fall.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** They trip and fall.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** They are prone.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** You actually did it again.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Another combat maneuver.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** That's very impressive.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** What do you want to do with your turn now?

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** You can be 5 feet away or 10 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** I have 10 foot reach with the check lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Of course you do, Rad.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Okay.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:32]** So can I use my move to get on top of them and, like, throw the binders on?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** And grapple them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** Yeah.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Is grapple a standard move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Or I have to do that next turn, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** You might have to do that next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** But I can get on top of them now or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** I think it's a standard action.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:50]** I mean, you could probably just get right next to them, which would, in effect, because you can't end your turn in the same square as them, but you could then grapple them next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Okay.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** Okay.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** I'll say...

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** You punk.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** You're going to pay for that.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Love it.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Love it.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Maybe you kind of start to put your boot on them.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** You're like, stay down.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** All right.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:13]** They are going to take one more swing, I think, with the knife while they're on the ground.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:21]** And they're going to take one more swing at you to see what they can get in their final possible moments here.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** That is going to be a 19 against EAC on you, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** Yeah, that's going to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Wow.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:39]** Okay, that's seven points of slashing damage as they cut through the leg of the boot that is pushing down on him.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** But they are staying down.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** They are staying down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:42 - 00:44:02]** yeah i can so i'm gonna use a defensive dispersal uh-huh uh-huh uh i think i can do that or either that or reactive spray okay uh just reading i think you do defensive dispersal as long as you have uh nensight surge available you should have at least three of those right

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** Yeah.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:09]** I don't see... It just says as a reaction, but it doesn't have, like, a counter for surges.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** So, like, I have... Oh, I can use it.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:15]** But is it a nanite surge, or is it a... If it's a dispersal, because I also have that.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** As a reaction, take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Oh, maybe it's just a reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Negates the damage from an attack.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Special effects.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** So there's a will save bonus for special attacks.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** That's all I was confused about.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** But, yeah.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** I will take that.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** And I will spend a surge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Who's it?

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Who's it?

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** Okay, so you're Surgeon, so we got Kara the Surgeon over here.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** How many points do you take less?

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Four.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Is that where you take less damage points?

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** Cool, so you only take three points of damage.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Rad as hell.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** That's cool.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** I should have disarmed you.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Look at this nanosite stuff.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Now I'm going to make you my...

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** Lightning doesn't strike twice, except he's behind the mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** So you can't really know what he's saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** It is the security guard who's over on the right, right by Migo.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:11]** They step forward, put their knee into the chest of the agent that's on the ground and looks up at you, Migo, and says, go.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** I got this.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** I got this.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** What?

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** Oh.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:19]** And then they are going to start grappling to hold that individual who is not protesting.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** And they're going to start turning them over to get on their side.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:27]** It is the individual, the agent, the assailant in the middle.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:33]** Both of their fellow agents, north and south of them, are on the ground.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** One of them is staying.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** One of them is not.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** What do they do?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Just rolling some dice here just to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** I'm so confused by the carousel on this thing.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Why?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:53]** Because it shows right now, it's showing the highlight on, looks like one of the all-black characters, and then me, and you're saying it's someone else.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** I don't know.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:57]** Is it the purple one, the second or fourth one on the carousel?

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:03]** Well, I think the character whose turn it currently is isn't in the carousel right now because they weren't on the map.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** No, it's this person's turn right here.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** They are in the carousel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** Never mind.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** No, you're on the right track.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:14]** It's just you don't see them because they're covered in yellow because of the sun, I guess.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** They're covered in yellow in the sun.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** I see them now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Sneaky.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Sneaky.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** You know what they're going to do?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Give up.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** They start running.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** They run into the hallway and they start booking it out of there.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:39]** So just to assess the situation, the one down in the bottom right is subdued.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Yes.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** The dinosaur is dead.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** The commander is still fighting somebody up in the top left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:50]** Yeah, the commander is still fighting the Lashunta who shouted all those words at the very beginning.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** Okay, let me make sure that I'm not over-encumbered.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** You probably are.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:03]** I'm going to take a double move in order to get up and around the corner heading towards the commander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Okay, so you start running over.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** You probably saw or heard the commander be like...

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** And them firing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:14]** I think he kind of, he just, he kind of, like, as soon as he got the dinosaur down, he kind of looked up.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** And then he can't see much because he's little.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** So he jumped.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** And maybe even, like, pushed his pike in.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Just enough to get up.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:26]** And he saw, like, he kind of just made contact, eye contact with, you know, what's going on.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** Just was able to spot everything.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** And saw.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Kara's handling her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Her own.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** So she's fine.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** She's, she's, she's good.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** But the commander's old and getting ready to retire.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** And he cares about her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** Just one day from retirement.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** Crazy how that always happens.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:47]** Hey, when you run, do you just let your pike just like across the ground?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Of course not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** He's a professional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Was a dinosaur also one day away from retirement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** He holds it perfectly balanced on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** And that way he can do like a pole vault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:26]** it's like the cheat code when it's faster to run and jump yeah yeah yeah uh kelly you will never know if that dinosaur was close to retirement or not because it's dead yeah i know and boom it's your turn there's a dinosaur is his family here just like crying over him in the past extinction so hey that's right yeah the good run uh these this purple guy is our guy or like a friendly is that correct or yeah okay and then the person down south is also friendly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:47]** that's kind of hard to know down south what do you mean yeah there's like someone at the very bottom uh yeah the one that's that's oh no further south than that yeah all the way down here oh no that's just somebody who didn't run away because they're eating and they don't want to leave so is that is that chad with his like actual burrito


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Yeah, let's chat.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Wait, when does this chronologically take place?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** No, it's not, John.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** It might be Chad.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** It's not Chad, but it's one of Chad's.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** It's Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** It's Brad.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** It's Brad.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** Still eating some of the fresh acutonium.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** No, that is Vlad.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** Uh-huh.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Comrade Vlad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** It's his plus one.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:18]** Comrade Vlad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** All right.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** I see.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** Okay.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:24]** So the only real mob, I think, is up in the upper right that I can see anyway.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:30]** So Boom is going to try to get in range because this person up here is an enemy, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** The one next to Kara?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:50:00]** yes and car is like right next to him that's fantastic once again because that means i'm gonna have to uh actually like shoot them again so wrong side technically speaking i should have moved you are providing cover so yeah so where are you running to boom is moving up and uh his movement speed is uh five feet you over encumbered me so much with all the stuff you gave us which is great stuff oh my gosh

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:20]** all right look i boom has this feature where he can stuff things in his cheeks so he's gonna put everything in his cheeks and then like i'm guessing that you're eating the fossils now seven guns like a bunch of the grenades and then these like rods everything's going in his cheeks for now especially the batteries oh my god all right so what's normal speed then i can't even tell anymore

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** For Yosuke, probably 33.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** It's Yosuke, yeah.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** In heavy armor, though.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** God, you've done a five, man.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** That's not going to change that.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** John gave me a bunch of things.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** We'll get there.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** We'll get there.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Don't worry.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** All right, all right.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** I'm just, hold on.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** I'm sorry.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I'm looking at his movement speed.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** I need to know.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:36 - 00:51:06]** it's probably it's probably 30 feet because i think it's probably 30 feet all right so let's cut it down to 15 like i guess uh so wait what why why why are you because i have heavy armor on i'm guessing that's part of the reason for me like that's not going to reduce your your speed dude just you're at 30 feet okay yeah all right so that's 5 10 15 20 25 30 uh i can't figure out how to move the map properly uh so all right so here we go so he's gonna shoot uh-huh it doesn't work that's complicated

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:11]** All right, so Boom is going to shoot this person up here.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** What's their name?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:12]** Okay.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** What's their name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Yeah, you should ask that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** Whatever, before you shoot them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** Is this the Ukrainian and Russian pilots ejecting next to each other?

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** Did you guys see that video?

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:31]** Okay, he's going to ask, There he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** What did they say?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Andy.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** Heavy armor definitely does speed adjustments.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** What heavy armor do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** And then he's going to shoot.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** It's like heavy armor.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** It's squad defined series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** You wouldn't put that on right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** Whatever you were wearing before is your heavy armor.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** All right.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Well, whatever.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** I moved 30 feet, so that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** It's fine.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Just move.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Yeah, you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** You're wearing formal wear.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** You're not wearing anything.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** What?

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** I think that you would have a shot.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** I don't think you would have cover on it.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** So what's your shot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** And then he fires this.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:16]** So I'm going to do it one more time for ranged attack.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Because I have no other choice.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Because everyone is close by.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** It's a 15.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It's a middling roll.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** But that's high for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** It hits.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** It hits.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** It hits.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Somehow, miraculously, it just hits.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Somehow, I can't believe it.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** It hits Andy instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** All right, I'm rolling for damage now.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Okay.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** And it's going to be five points of damage.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** We take what we can get.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:43]** That's pretty good, actually.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** That's pretty good.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** That's pretty good.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Okay.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** So five rounds go... And, like, pepper.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Pepper.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Love it.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Love it.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** Can you do that again?

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Okay, so you...

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** That was pretty good.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:04]** All right, so we have one assailant that has run, one that has given up, one that is still fighting on their back.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:22]** You can guess the leader is still fighting Commander Bolt, and you all are just starting to make short work of them as you're just whittling away with Boom's shot at his Russian-friendly Andy and taking out five points of damage on them.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** And it's their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Big question.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Kev.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** Did you say King Kara?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** What?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Earlier you said something about King Kara.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** King Kara, yeah.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** King Kara, Ken Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** King Kara.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:37]** He said King Kara, but I think that was... Like, we're just calling her Kara.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Not like King, like Monarch Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Wait, what?

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** But Kara is our team.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Is this a Mario character?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Right.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Yes.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** But you said the villain... Is King Kara?

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** It might have been a slip.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** But the one that is attacking Commander Bolt in the top left corner.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Uh-huh.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Are we supposed to know who they are yet?

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Have you asked them their name yet?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** No, but you said it.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** You said Ken Kara.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Okay.

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** Sounds good.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** So, the... Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** Andy... Yes, we were supposed to know that.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Andy...

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:11]** Is actually going to... You know what?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** I think that they are going to... They did not roll well.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** They dropped the knife.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** Kara.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** That's smart.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:28]** Especially after getting hit in their shoulder from their Russian friend and feeling like maybe they have an ally.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Maybe they have an ally.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Migo, what are you doing right now?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** Three of the assailants have run or given up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** Okay.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** And the fourth active is up next to the AV table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Yes.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** Yes.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** The one whose name you have not asked yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** Let's see how far away that is.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** Miko is going to double move.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** He's going to survey the room first.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** See that the person in front of him is in cuffs.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** The person next to Kara is well handled.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** The dinosaur is down.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Love him.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** So he's going to just book it.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Double move.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:15]** And as he takes the first stride, you see some of the augmentations from the hammer, like, travel, ripple down his arm, down his body, into his, like, calves.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Uh-huh.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** And he just bolts, double moves for 100 feet.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** Just some dad calves there, baby.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Yeah.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Just like defensive line level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Like on his feet.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** In his Nike Monarchs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Is that a feat that you have?

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** New balance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** New balance, yeah.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Sure.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Yeah, no.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** So that's an evolutionist trait.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:50]** So like as you spend longer in combat, you gain mutation points.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** At certain thresholds, you get different bonuses.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** That's cool.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** So I currently have three mutation points.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:01]** When I have three mutation points, I get a plus 10 to my speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** That is awesome.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** That's cool.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** You get one per round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:10]** That's just until I get fewer than three mutation points.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** That's cool.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:15]** I can spend those points to do things and get rid of those points.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:22]** It's a double-edged sword because there's also the more mutated I am, I can take more.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:25]** We'll explore more as we go through more battles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** I love it so far.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:45]** I never want to play one but it sounds fun I was going to say on my move I thought twice about just jumping up onto the stand where the giant dinosaur bones are squiggling my way through there but I was like that's a bad idea


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** But then you, yeah, you might just get stuck in the bones.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:51]** You're like, you're trying to go through with your pike and it gets caught.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** So the ribs.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Right.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** Yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Classic.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** Classic.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** All right.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Anything else we go?

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** No, that's it.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Besides wear some sport and some new shoes.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Cool.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:09]** It is the agent down south who is being handcuffed by the security guard.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:19]** They are absolutely being happy with their choice at this moment to just give up and not take it too far.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** It is the, let's say, leader's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03
