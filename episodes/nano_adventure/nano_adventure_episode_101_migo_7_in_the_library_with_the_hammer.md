## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** You like call and response.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** You like to respond.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** He is the response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Like so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Yeah.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Yeah.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Kelly.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Like a hype band.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** Yeah.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** He's our internal hype man.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** He's our yes man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:11]** On the We'll Save Hip Hop track, Kelly does all the ad-libs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** Kelly, we're going to start with you because you're going to be first this time.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Not the response.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:23]** If you could watch one movie for the rest of your life, what would it be?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** And also, would it be one of the Sony Spider-Mans?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:53]** no those um we were saying earlier that toby i was saying earlier that toby mcguire yeah he i don't know why i don't know like he's yeah he he can't act so like all he does is he's just an emotionless blob that like looks at the screen and i don't understand why anyone likes him

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:58]** And like he just he he's so pathetic looking the entire time.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** But they are.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** But then people are like, oh, I feel really bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:11]** It's funny because if you came into this conversation just like two seconds late and had no idea, like we didn't know the name of the person you're talking about that could apply to like half of Hollywood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Okay, there are other people, but he's pretty bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:19]** Let's substantiate this, because I have a question for you, Kelly, to clarify this point that you're trying to make.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** How do you feel about Kristen Stewart?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:26]** I haven't seen Twilight or anything that she's in, but I've heard that that's the same situation.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** So, like...

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** I think that he's the Kristen Stewart.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** He's like Kristen Stewart.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** All right.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** So, but, and then people I've, the explanation I've heard, everyone always says, well, he plays the nerdy Peter Parker.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** Well, who's awkward, but that's not how fucking Peter Parker is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:48]** I remember 10 years older than Peter Parker should have been at the time.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Like, yeah, there's a lot wrong with that casting.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** There's a lot wrong with those movies.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** So was Andrew Garfield.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** But Andrew Garfield,

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Andrew Garfield looks like he's 12, so it works out.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** But it's not just how it looks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** There's something else.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** I thought Andrew Garfield did a fantastic job with Spider-Man.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:13]** They ruined it with the second movie with the lizard.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:21]** No, they ruined it with the lizard, and then the second movie had Electro, which they redeemed him in the...

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** I think they did a really good job redeeming all those characters and those arcs.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Shout out to J.B.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Fox.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** It's just bad direction.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** It's bad direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** Didn't they have... He was in Seabiscuit, too.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** He was in Seabiscuit, and the same thing happened.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** He was also in Pleasantville.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** He would just look at his horse with no emotion at all the entire time.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** That's because if you have too many emotions, your horse is going to bite you in the face.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** What about Pleasantville?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** I don't have a huge sample size.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Because he's had two movies.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** I love Pleasantville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** What are you talking about?

**[00:05:50 - 00:06:14]** plus the bill was like just two and a half hours too long like they could have just made that whole movie and like condensed it and like i remember i maybe i just saw when i was too young i think it was like 13 or 14 when i saw that movie i think so i was like okay and it's all black and white right now oh they're turning color and then it's like but they're going black and white again and it's just like back and forth back and forth and i was like i'm done with this and i walked were you watching it on mute


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** No, in a theater.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:21]** Because it seems like he just recapped it without any of the audio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** You might as well.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** You didn't know it was a talkie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** He didn't know it was a talkie.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:29]** Yeah, I mean, we should ask Will about that because he was around when that was new.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** So it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** There are very few movies I've actually walked out of, and that's one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:37]** So, to be clear, is the question now... What is the movie you've walked out of?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** This is now the question, is what movie have you walked out of?

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:45]** It was... I think what was your favorite movie, but Kelly ruined that, so instead we're going to go with... Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** DuckTales movie.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** I would watch the DuckTales movie over and over again until the end of it.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** That's a f***ing great movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** I was thinking Toy Story.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** That's a standard.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** That's a standard.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** I'm for this.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** I love it.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** I would watch Toy Story.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** I think I could watch Toy Story a million times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** So can we take a slight left turn?

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** Because I think John was going to ask about what movie you've walked out of.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** Can we just talk about the worst movie you've ever seen that maybe you didn't walk out of but you probably should have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Oh, I've watched a lot of shitty movies.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** I've seen a lot of really bad movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** I learned to appreciate the writers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** I can appreciate the creativity.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** I can appreciate the art form.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:24]** I've been involved with enough production that I understand that even a shitty movie is a heroic undertaking.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** I love really bad movies.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** I watch a lot of bad movies.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:36]** I saw out of darkness recently out of darkness and it's such a bad movie.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:44]** It like the, the photography, because so much of it is spent at night is you're just like, this is pitch black.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:48]** We've got a 30 foot wide black screen and I have no idea what's going on.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:53]** The movie is a period piece, but it's like ancient Scotland period piece.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** So like it could be ancient anywhere.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** There's a made up language.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** So like you've got to read all of the dialogue.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** There's not really a compelling protagonist.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:12]** The main conflict is just like humans of different tribes trying to figure out how to coexist and they end up killing each other because that's what we've done for all time.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:40]** like it's the top to bottom the worst movie i've ever seen in my life interesting yeah what's it called again out of darkness out of darkness yeah i saw amc does this thing where like you can buy a ticket for i think it was called this something screamies and like you show up at a given time and nobody knows what the movie is going to be until the movie starts and that was the movie and i mean by that point i was committed i wasn't going to walk out

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** How long of a movie is it?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** It's two hours.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** It's normal feature length.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Okay.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:47]** It came out a year ago, maybe two years ago in the UK.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** And just recently, I think it's about to come out in the US.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I'm going to watch it and probably love it.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** You probably are going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** You're probably going to love it.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** I would love to hear your feedback on this movie.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:16]** after you see it yeah yeah there's also like ancient barbers apparently like they had perfect fades yeah of course yeah facial hair yeah just a some weird choices i think so one of the worst movies i ever saw this is back in the blockbuster days i like saw the um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** the movie on the shelf.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** I was like, huh, that sounds interesting.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** I just picked it up.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:30]** It was called bunker and it was, uh, I think it was like a straight to video independent film, but it had some pretty big names at the time in it.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** Um, but I loved 75% of the movie.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** I loved it.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:57]** then it ruined like the whole idea is it it's i think they're germans in germany during world war ii and or or they're like i forget what it is either way it's it's like you know allies versus the axis or whatever the case is and they get stuck in a bunker and then while they're in the bunker

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** They're stuck in there so long, they start to go delusional.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** And then people start dying.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:06]** But then it's like this whole debate of like, well, the ghosts are killing them.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Or, you know, there's a murderer.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** They're all going nuts.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** And they're losing their minds about who's doing what and how they're dying.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:22]** And for a long time, it was just like, up until like three quarters of the way through the movie, it is all just, you know, conspiracy and stuff.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** And then it turns out there's actually like a giant spider monster...

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:45]** you're just like okay this is this is like it three like what are we it was very i it was poorly made and then like the spider was very terribly done and yeah it just ruined the whole movie but yeah this is apparently a there is a new one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** possibly 2022.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** So just saying it's out there.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** Yeah.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** It's about the 2022.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Yeah.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** It's not 2022.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** I watched it like 10 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:00]** I like to, when I'm going to see what movie is like going to be on, but that like I'm watching, right?

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:04]** Like, like I was looking for, uh, you know, like, like Dune or something.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:09]** And then, you know, I'm on some streamer, uh,

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:14]** And there's always something like people who watched this one also watched this or also like this.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Also watched Scanners.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Yeah.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** And I love going through and seeing like just movies that I never even knew existed.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:28]** And then like you watch those trailers or you read the reviews left by people on their like Firecube or like whatever, you know.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** And it's great.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Yeah.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** I don't end up watching them, but I do end up wondering.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:42]** And I spend a little too long researching the movie and seeing what happened to it.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** I don't watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Well, you do that, though.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:49]** You just read the entire movie, like, synopsis or, like, a scene by scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** That's for horror movies, and that's for a separate version.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** I know, but... And I used to make fun of John for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** Here it is.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:00]** Now that I have children and don't have any time, I end up reading about movies, and, like, yeah.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:05]** It's the movies that, like, I don't have the time or the energy to sit through.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:05]** Right.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Then I'll read the synopsis.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** But you're curious.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Makes a difference.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Yeah.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** I found it.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** It's called The Bunker, and it came out in, I think, 2001.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Not to be confused with Bunker.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Got it.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Got it.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** Right.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** And it's Germans that end up... Hold on.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** This is what it says.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Germany, 1944.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** The Forest of Ardennes.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:37]** A platoon of wary German soldiers forced into confusion and retreat by advancing Allied forces take refuge in an isolated Siegfried Line bunker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:37 - 00:13:06]** yeah anyways does uh yeah does anyone have one that they want to share before we get started yeah i was gonna say for movies i didn't i i've i don't know if i've ever walked out of a movie um but like um but the one that i really really disliked was the teenage mutant ninja turtles one done by uh what's his name the guy who doesn't do good things but like he does explosions well that's like his only oh yeah uh michael bay yeah the michael bay movies spider-man or uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies were mediocre at best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** I fell asleep.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** I actually fell asleep, which is rare in movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:18]** Is that where there's the ooze and vanilla ice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:23]** No, that's where there's CGI buff muscular ooze.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** The 90s TMNT.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:43]** killer they were they got worse and worse they were all better than i would watch that 100 me too the seth the seth rogan uh new one is actually really good uh animated one cool that's a computer animated one yeah everything's computer animated yeah that's what i've heard yeah

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** Also, I don't like the original trilogy.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:53]** I feel like if I watched it again today, I would walk out of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** So we're full circle.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** We're back to where we started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Really?

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Just pissing off Sam Raimi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** That's the whole point of this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Although, What's-His-Name was really cool.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** The villain.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** Not the Green Goblin, because he was ridiculous.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** But when he wasn't the Green Goblin, yeah, William Dafoe.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** He's so good.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** I mean, he's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** I really liked it.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** I actually really liked those movies.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Maybe I'm alone.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** I didn't think the movies were bad.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Most people agree with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Most people like them.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** So it's my fault, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** It is your fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** And Army of Darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Great.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Okay.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:51]** that's a classic dr strange love no dr strange in the multiverse of madness i think it's a bad movie it no it what it's whoa it was a well guys we're we're almost at the 15 minute limit here come on this is a i i can't let that slide though this was incredible

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:56]** I think there were a lot of things that were changed to it, especially in the very beginning.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:00]** And if Sam Raimi could go back and do a Raimi's edit, then I think it would come out almost perfect.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Sam Raimi did it.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:06]** He did it, but then there's producers and other bureaucracy that changes movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** The new Ant-Man movie was so bad that that one I almost walked out of for sure.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** That one was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** I thought it was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** What was bad about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** The Ant-Man movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Yes.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:25]** The one where they go into the micro world or whatever and then like what?

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Bill Murray's in it?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Yeah, Bill fucking Murray.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** Bill Murray is cool.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** But like literally it is insanely boring.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** I would say it's boring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** I would agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** It's a little slow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** You know what's not boring?

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Nothing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** You know what's not boring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Starfinder.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Starfinder.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** We'll take the podcast.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** Let's go.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** We'll take the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Let's go.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** One of literally thousands of podcasts.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Proud.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** One of literally thousands.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** Proud to be one of literally thousands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** Yeah.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** See, there it is.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** There's only like 2,000 podcasts out there.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:11]** You know, another situation where we would be proud to be one of literally thousands is our attendance at Gen Con in Indianapolis in August.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** That's more than thousands, right?

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Could be tens of thousands.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** How many people are there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Dozens.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** Dozens of thousands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** If you're going to Gen Con, you will know how hard it was to get housing.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:34]** We had a huge adventure just trying to get a place to exist in Indianapolis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:39]** We had a whole business meeting to the point where we didn't even resolve this problem on ourselves.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** We had to combine with another...

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:45]** group of individuals that also record their content to put it out.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:53]** You might call them podcasters of the Southern Tomfoolery Persuasion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Strange Table Fellers.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Strange Table Fellers is their new name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** We're going to be living with them for like four days.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:12]** In case you're not a possum or we haven't said anything on our Discord, we're going to be hanging out with the Strange Table Fellers folks for Gen Con this year.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:39]** also finder we're gonna hang out with finder as well and find we're gonna find we're gonna find finder for the first time and i'm pretty sure he's gonna find us it's okay it's the finder embarrassing moment it didn't occur to me until this week his handle was finder of the path all right yep was that that was a pathfinder and starfinder reference it's very just all the way over my head until this week maybe i drink too much i don't know maybe we'll uh we'll find you there

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:11]** Matthew, if I see you again, don't be mean to me for not knowing things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** Are you worried about people being mean to you, Kelly?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Matthew Lillard was mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** He's not a fan, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** Kelly's face was like hands over his face.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** It's like, please don't get mad at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:31]** We don't know if he listens or doesn't.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Thanks for listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** With that, let's get back into why are you doing this?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Fact, man.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** You asked.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** You asked.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** Gen Con 2023 had 70,000 visitors.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** No one asked that.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** 75 of dozens of 70 of thousands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:54]** And with that, you are 70,000 feet below the surface.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** You're not, actually.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** You're not that far beneath the surface.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:00]** You guys remember that time we stonewalled John from actually starting?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** That was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Good times.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** It happens every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Alright, 3, 2, 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:12]** It is as consistent as Kelly's response to Welcome to Will Save is being so involved.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** It's good.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** It's good.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** And throughout this whole nice business side of things, we've had the recap music playing, so it's made it extra.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Give it the extra gravity.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Super quick recap.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:38]** You were deep down in the mountain, in the trenches of Morrow, in a cliffside, following Leora's signal that you've been alerted is.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Beep, beep, beep, beep.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:57]** Moving further down into the mountain, you come into a secret staircase from Leora's home office after you very brilliantly deduced that the painting above the secret staircase was showing you 20 seconds into the future.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:05]** And you figured out the right code sunlight to open up the door and descend.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:13]** You find a hidden warehouse full of stacks of books, art, statues.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:19]** Didn't get a chance to see what it all said, to see what it was all about.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:30]** Because you start fighting a dogmatic Shabbat sniper perched in the corner of this little hidden treasure trove.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** Cara steps up car and the sniper.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:39]** I feel like going shot for shot, just like gets a shot off, shoots him in the same spot.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Cara nails it.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** Professional is always dealing a bunch of damage.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:47]** Cecil starting to get creative to throw an entangled grenade.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** I know I should have saved probably, but figure that out later.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** It's all good.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** They are entangled because they're not moving.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** They're trying to take you out there.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Boom, also creative, takes a page out of Cecil's book, or was it the other way around?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:03]** Throws up this grenade to summon an Electrovor to attack.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** And Miko, I think, is about ready to do some damage.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** But we ended last time.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** It's not an Electrovor, John.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** What was it?

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Sorry.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Apologies.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** It was an electric guy.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** An electric guy.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** Is that the Starfinder Paizo term?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:22]** He's an electric Atronach or something like that, which is all I can think of because I'm thinking of Skyrim.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Elemental.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:23]** Elemental.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:23]** There it is.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** Thank you.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** We just keep calling it the Electrovor because your ears has the Electrovor statue.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:33]** I mean, I appreciate the call out, but I don't want to insult Electrovor with this new person.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** We don't know if he's cool or not.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** I don't know anything about this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** We don't know this person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I don't know what his name is.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** How long does it last for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** You read into that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:56]** Read it as we determine what happens next because I believe Cecil came up and alley-ooped his pike over the railing and then stabbed the Shabbat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** The Shabbat goes down and then comes back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** One day we'll figure out your definition of value.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Oh, man.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** It's the only definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** What does it mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** What does it mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** We read it to you.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** We've gone over this.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Everyone kept calling it something else.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** We have gone over this.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** I'm going to bring you guys back to the map here.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** The Shabbat is up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** And Migo.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Hey, Kevin, you're really going to hate this.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Kevin's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Kevin's gone.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** But I think he'll be back in just a sec.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** Migo, what do you want to do with your turn?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** It is your turn in round two of this fight.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** The Shabbat has gone down.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** You are still on the ground standing next to Migo.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Kara is across the room next to the windows.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Got a good vantage point.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Cecil's run up the stairs.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:46]** And Electric Guy is standing behind the Shabbat Sniper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:46 - 00:23:12]** sorry yeah what's up no no what's up man all right am i the only one um who can i only see the spinning logo on founder i see the the building yeah i see the man uh i only see the spinning one i'm gonna give her a reload second let me on let me on uh oh i see it pause and pause oh wait no i see it yeah

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:08]** you know, I was going to say, uh, when you try to connect from halfway around the world, like, yeah, we're, we're a lot of stress on our system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:15]** And also a lot of stress as you are starting to run your stamina and hit points low here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:20]** I mean, it's, it's only got, it's only got 378 gigs of Ram.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** That's it.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** What?

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:27]** It's enough to compile, uh, some good things.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** So I can put that to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** It's,

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** Yeah, I'm just checking our usage for the Foundry.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:39]** So Foundry, we're using 200 megs of the 4 gigs I provisioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** Solid.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** Cool, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** That's probably the issue.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** I've got 6 CPU cores.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** I've got 48 logical cores.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** There's no... There's a ceiling somewhere, but I haven't hit it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** Is this Migo's attack?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** Is reading out the specs of the server box?

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Just wait long enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:03]** He'll just pass out.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Yay, I'm back!

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** He rotates with me.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** That's nice.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Migo...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** We're trying to have this serious thing all over the place.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** And Kevin is rotating his character.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** Just can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Just can't get.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Also, Kevin.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Do a little dance.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Make a little love.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Get down tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:33]** As Kelly rotates his boom, the electrical elemental...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:56]** is also rotating which is actually kind of cute his official name is electric guy i guess also kevin you're really gonna hate this but there's no time limit to him pizan sorry that's probably that's probably not true you've like uh okay i'll get back to you on that one like continue on the bone he's gonna get to the bottom of that so migo what are you doing right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:00]** So, Migo very strategically placed himself here.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** I'm actually really... I'm so excited for my turn right now.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** I'm going to spend two mutation points for those tracking at home.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Migo gets a mutation point at the start of each of his turns.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:22]** What I get by spending those two mutation points is a climb speed of half of my movement speed.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Wow.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** So, we have canonically...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:51]** figured out that this ledge is about eight to ten feet high so migo is just gonna like scurry himself all the way up right next to this shabbat wow whip out his big ass hammer and shabong this wow so you run up this heavy duty door leap over the railing going to shabong


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:51 - 00:27:02]** I imagine he utilizes every bit of his air maxes to yeet himself over the barrier, the railing, the safety wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:05]** Like a cool TMNT flip jump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Right.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:10]** So that is a 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:14]** 21 to hit against EAC.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Even with a melee weapon?

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** Because it's an electric weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** Kelly is still turning his tokens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** I'm not doing that on purpose, I swear to God.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:28]** Yeah, Boom is just doing pirouettes as he watches all of this unfold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Can you just, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Yes, that hits.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Awesome.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Yeah.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** So then that is... There you go.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** That's a one on the die for eight electric damage.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** One on the die.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Yeah, tell me.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** It's just like he jumps over the ledge, but he does kind of a gainer move.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** over and just brings the hammer right down on this Shabbat's knee.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** The head would be a much higher role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:53 - 00:28:03]** So it brings it, brings it down on like his knee and you can just see like the electric charge all the way through pulses right through their massive body.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:13]** They are a large creature and their whole, their whole body shakes and then they fall dead to the ground.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Nice.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:21]** Okay, so speaking of electric energy, let's go back to the summoning grenade thing.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** What level is your summoning grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:27]** I think it was a really good question.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Mark one?

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** It's a two or a three.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** Hold on.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Mark two is level six.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** It must be two then.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** It's whatever the max I can do is.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** So give me like a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:40]** So that would be a second level summon creature caster level six.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** And so it is one round per level.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** So it'd be six levels.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Six levels.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** If it's a mark two.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Okay.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Or six rounds.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:53]** Do you know like the meme of like the actually kid?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** Like whenever someone says something and then there's someone who's like, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** Kelly, if you just followed the rules, man, I don't know what to tell you.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** It's not.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** It says when you throw the grenade, it casts summon creature.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** So just look up summon creature.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** That gives you the rules about the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** Is your contention that you're not actually a kid or that you are, but only because we don't read the rules?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Actually.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** I'm just upset you don't read the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:23]** He's upset that we don't, like, I'm helping out with notes today, okay?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:23]** I'm helping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** We're all making little baby steps toward, like, being good with you.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** I'm not helping with notes today, and that's my task.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** Well, the notes should say Kelly got summoning a grenade wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:36]** Because I have heavy-handed typing skills.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Unless you type one at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** But you type very quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** My other keyboard is a typewriter, and that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** That's why your fingers are so strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Is that a bumper sticker?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** My other keyboard is a typewriter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** The Shabbat goes down.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** Cecil is standing on the steps.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** Migo is standing up.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Did you get a plus two on that attack?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** You didn't need it, but you probably could have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:10]** Well, what's really fun is because combat is over, he loses all of the evolution points and no longer has a climb speed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:37]** so migo isn't entirely sure how he's getting back down there are stairs just gotta like there are stairs oh there's a door isn't there a door here oh good the electric guy can carry you down oh good well how so electric guy lasts for six rounds so 36 seconds yeah he's gonna be he's gonna be available for like 36 seconds well we're not in round yeah we're not in turn-based combat anymore so i imagine i know that's why you gotta hurry up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Electric guy, come down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** What do you all want to do?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:45]** You're standing in this hidden library warehouse with all these books around.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** There's a large car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** It's going to approach.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** This doesn't make sense, John.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** I think across the...

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Is there, like, some sort of, like, safe?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** There is a large... What is this facade here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Yeah, there's a large, heavy door.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** Like a... You would think a door that's the same that would be in front of a vault door.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** That is right underneath the perch that the Shabbat was in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** Cecil rolled a 22 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** What is the rest of it?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:30]** boom is looking at this like pharaoh painting and uh seeing if there's anything he's gonna like perceive this and then other stuff around this general area cool i will cara you're investigating the door i'm guessing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yes.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Kara's going to be investigating the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** And Migo, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Migo's checking the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Migo's checking the body.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Love it.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Love it, love it, love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Cool.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** Um... Kara rolled a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Kara rolled a... Okay.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** It's a big s*** door.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** It's a big door.

**[00:31:49 - 00:32:00]** You think that there have to be services, like a computer that can unlock it, but it's large enough, and you would know, I think just from your experiences, that...

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** You do have a laser drill with you.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:11]** Given enough time and in the right spot, you could probably laser drill your way into the door, at least through where either any of the locks are.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** You could probably get through.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** So you could try with computers.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** It might be tough.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** You know typically these are pretty heavily secure.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:25]** Or given a couple minutes, the right locations, you can use your laser drill.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Maybe somebody can help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:42]** yeah oh i have drills is there like any sign that like uh their room or is it like a self-contained unit you're not sure yet like it's yeah okay not sure yet it's a good question it's a good question we've got to get in this vault i think


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:53]** Cara, I have specific, if you remember from bathroom stall, specific weapon slash device for helping out with, and I'll help you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:59]** Well, my knowledge of these things is about as similar as that bathroom stall, apparently.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:04]** This door is just massive.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:08]** Well, did we search this guy's body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** That's what Migo's doing right now, right?

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Migo?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** That's correct.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Got it.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:19]** You see that this is another member of the IFF.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** But if you give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Do you have culture?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** Yes, he has culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Carl will assist.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** Yeah, you're shouting down what you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** That is a 13, but it's a minus 5.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** It's related to militaries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Okay.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Cool.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** 13 and then plus 2 from Kara.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** So 15.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Yeah, that's enough to know.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** And Kara, you might know too because you've been around.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:58]** This is Malarash, who is a well-known Shabbat sniper who, as of the past few years, you haven't heard a lot of.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Typically a mercenary killer for hire.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** Sometimes on the same side as you, sometimes not.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** You know that they...

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** have been known to have very strong opinions in the past.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** And sometimes when they are a mercenary for a certain group, they can take on those beliefs.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** But for the past few years, you haven't heard about them.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** And you see the IFF symbol.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:35]** You do remember that they lost, of course, in the terrible backstory, lost a lot of their tribe, even though that tribe was warned that there would be a terrible tragedy.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** And Malarash was the only one who listened.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** And that part of their backstory seemed to resonate.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:50]** And you can see their trajectory of how they are now laying here before you dead.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Dead, yeah.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** But well-known sniper, well-known mercenary.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Are we just this good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** You see Migo take a knee and pay respect to...

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:26]** malarash like if if nothing else migo will respect his his art for like his dedication to the craft if not his motivations behind it does migo say anything or just quiet um just a quiet like you know two knuckles on his forehead committing his spirit to the elders and love it you know okay warrior to warrior yeah it was a good battle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:44]** okay cecil didn't know if anybody else wanted to do something cecil you rolled a what was your perception well i wanted this 22 and what was your perception boom that's right it's 19 but i was looking at the pharaoh thing you were looking at the useful that's what we wanted to know they're both pretty good behind that's pretty good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:44 - 00:36:14]** uh i'll say this boom and cecil you see that a lot of these books are very specific logs and records about the history of ringworks okay you go through uh and i would say that do you take a few minutes to like kind of peruse through look through things


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Why, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:25]** While that's going on, I think Kara's going to investigate the body further for any signs of where the...

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:38]** Our target is and check the computers for any access to the safe or whatever this door vault looking thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Okay.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** Hey, is everyone... Kara, are you all right?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Do you need to take a rest?

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** I've... I've...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:51 - 00:37:03]** I'm hurt, yes, but I think it's more important to start to figure out where our target, the kidnapped is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** I think we got 10 minutes.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Just take a breather.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** As the team medic, I think it's my responsibility to tell you to do that.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** All right, then.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Love it.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:16]** During that rest, I know, Cara, you're just kind of perusing around the computer.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:21]** You think that the computer there could possibly open the door.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** But I don't know what your computer skill is, but it will be possible.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** It seems like it might be tough to get in.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** The body.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Yeah, the body is...

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:37]** there's nothing more on the body about where your target might be.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:48]** But checking out their data pad, I think there's a message on there from an unknown number that just says, hold them off as long as possible.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:55]** Cecil and Boom, you are looking through the logs, thumbing through.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** You start to realize that Morrow...

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:05]** Mara was one of the first ringworks factories.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Not for too long.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:13]** But you can see really early dormant ship designs and logs.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Maybe you're looking through kind of a history.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:21]** You see that this was also a steward's office before.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:25]** It was headquartered here in this same location.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:34]** And it was labeled as one of the... Let's say one of its one-of-a-kind offices.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** It seems that there's a lot of references to the draws for this office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** How do you spell that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** D-R-A-W-S.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:49]** Then, as Thasteron was really booming...

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** a lot of available space.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:58]** After the steward's office, they moved, I think, over to the hive market, I think is where they are now.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:04]** And then all available space needed to be turned into Thastron.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:09]** And so this became a geothermal Thastron manufacturing plant for a while.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** Obviously, Thastron did not last.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:19]** And so it's the chosen location returning to a ringworks office feels very circular.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:25]** You're going through, you realize there's like a history of like every single Ringworks model ship.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:30]** There's like, you know, Ringworks is one of the oldest manufacturers of ship in the packed worlds.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** There's evidence of their manufacturing pre-gap, right?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:40]** And so you see that there are some records that are pre-gap records here that you would never be able to find.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:44]** But they're like designs and launch testings of like Aether ships, right?

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:50]** That launch from Skydock, that's where on Versys, that's where Ringworks started.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:55]** You see rogue designs of ships that never made it to the factory floor.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** You see luxury ships, which Ringworks is not known for luxury.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:02]** They're known for very good quality, but stable quality.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:27]** right middle of the road like a good balance of price practical fast adaptable you see an early design for the ringworks wanderer that's it's there's probably one in every docking bay from here to the vest right like like that's like such a ubiquitous ship this is a clearly a library and and sacred space for ringworks where they keep some of their kind of offline information but

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:41]** That includes Ringworks personnel, notable CEOs, founders, full biographies, day-to-day decisions, a lot of logs.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** Give me whoever is looking through here, because, Cara, you're looking at the computer.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:53]** Whoever's looking through books, walking around in this check, or Cara, maybe if you want to as well, give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** So I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Okay.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:00]** Cara will roll.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:27]** migo you are still doing this doing this taking a break but paying reverence and respect to the body um man i think she rolled a one she rolled the one it's fine you can't for an 11 yeah that's that's still good enough okay but i'm surprised that car would roll a one knowing car she seems like very knowledgeable she's focused on the computer yeah that makes sense migo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** I imagine like he's paid respects.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** There's, there's a time and a place.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:37]** And I think the time is, is he's paid respect and it's time to move on to the task at hand.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Okay.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:42]** Um, he's probably noticed by now the stairs leading down.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:50]** And so if there's not a wall collision, he'll move down and start inspecting the books and try to figure out clues to figure out what, what the next right thing to do is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Boom, boom, rolled 18 culture.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** We'll pick a number between one and four.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Two.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Was that inclusive of one and four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Yes.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Or could he only pick two and three?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** That's a good question.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Including one and four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Wait, can I change my answer?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** No.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Zero.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Uh, logic.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:20]** Uh, Betty, give me a... I'm gonna roll with a four.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Okay.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Kelly and Kevin, give me something.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** You can roll a d4 if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Between a one and a four.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Can I just choose one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Then I got a one.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** I got three.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** Kevin got a three.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Yeah.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:34]** Kelly, you can choose one or... We won't choose a four, I guess.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Boom.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** You're looking through and then...

**[00:42:38 - 00:43:08]** just barely you feel your electric guy no what's happening unless your guy unfortunately uh vanished after trying to did he because he's still on this map he's upside down you put him in the dark spot of the map okay all right so it's like okay got it got it got it

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:14]** As he starts walking around and he's about to tell you the secret of the meaning of life, he's like, ah, fades away.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** So you'll never know.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** That's what the shock was.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** You feel the static shock.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:23]** Your data is going off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Alright, boom, boom, opens data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:33]** It's... It's not an unknown number, it's just not a contact that you have on your phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** So I know it, but it's not on my phone?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** They're reporting the number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Yeah, it's reporting the number.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** It doesn't say that it's private, hidden.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** It's not scammed likely.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** It's not scammed likely.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** What's the area code?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** Tomorrow area code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** He picks up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Hello?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Is this Boop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Yeah, it's Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** I have good news for you, Boom.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I have the best news for you.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** You sitting down?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** You ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Yes, yes.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Finally, subscription went through.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** He sits on the couch in front of where the bookshelf curves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Okay, all right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:22]** Do you recall the other day when at the Morrow Museum you guessed the number of beans at the Morrow Morrow Bean Contest?

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** Well...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** You guessed the closest.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:33]** You've won a year's subscription to Mario Beans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:36]** How do you feel?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** Well, it's great news.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** I feel very good.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** What is subscription?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** Do I get to eat bean or do I get magazine for bean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:45:04]** You get a year supply of beans, so you'll have a monthly subscription of beans delivered to your door, as well as the Beanly, which is our monthly magazine, all things about Mari Maro beans, including interviews with staff.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** and some coupons in case you want to extend for friends and family discount.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Obviously, you got an extra one there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** And we're thinking, this is new.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** We've never done this before for our winners.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** You get a tour of the factory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:41]** in next month so hope your schedule's open hope you're ready uh but you get to come see how the beans are made as they say oh fantastic it is as for the magazine and bean delivery i will give you address right now and uh and then he sent overseas he has a family to feed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:50]** Are you talking about the bean thing where Boom literally bullshitted the amount?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** Right before the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** The attack was very unfortunate.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:00]** But for the purposes of this promotion and sweepstakes and giveaway, you did win.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** So I wanted to call you and just let you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Well, I appreciate it.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** That is great customer service to hear from you directly.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** And I'm glad to see you are healthy and okay.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** I really appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** If it's okay, at the end of this call, there may be a very short survey.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:21]** So if you could just rate how I was between one and five, I would really appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** Look, if you want to stay on the line, Jared's going to come on the line.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** He's going to get all the information to send to you.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Is that okay?

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** Oh, so you don't give Cecil's address?

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** It's pretty quick.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:53]** Well, Cecil's address he's going to give, but the review, they never know.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** They never know if you actually did it.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Hopefully.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** Do you think?

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** It's all randomized, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:07]** Turns out she's going to be the villain in Threefold because you didn't fill it out.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:30]** all right so uh that happened and thanks yeah yeah you won beans for life well for the next year so well cecil did cara you gave a culture check and uh cecil you don't have culture right and kelly did you i have no culture yeah culturalist yeah you are yeah he rolled an 18 culture okay

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:35]** As you're on the phone, everyone else is chilling, walking, typing on the computer.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Your eyes just, like, scan over.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** You just, like, look.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** There's a bust.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** There's a name on the bust.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** The name is Mycroft Black.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** You're like, hmm.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** That's a cool name.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** That's about right.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Then you're looking over...

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:58]** You see a couple volumes talk about Mycroft Black.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:03]** You're just kind of maybe perusing as you're on speakerphone, starting to look through.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:08]** And then that's, you know, you just say Cecil's address and you hang up.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:23]** And you start just thumbing through pages about Mycroft Black's time as one of the pivotal CEOs of Ringworks, skilled inventor of micro technologies for Starships.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** A lot of work with...

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:33]** Keeping the same power output while reducing the footprint for a lot of different technologies across the whole manufacturing process.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:41]** This includes a lot of cutting edge science and magic incorporation.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** You see that there's even work that they did with nanites.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:52]** There's a lot that they built that you maybe see and you and Cara and Migo, you're like,

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** I see the descendants of this idea.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** I see the descendants of this technology and what I'm using today.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Brilliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** We're all looking at our own hands like –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:21]** Then you look over and listed on a page, you feel the thickness and you're like, pull the page apart and realize that there's a fold out piece of paper that is folded in quadrants.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** And you can, it's bigger than the book.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** You fold it out.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** Some sort of large... Yeah, it's porn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** It's a microbe.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** It's porn.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Naked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:41]** Looking over the shoulder with the buns out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** It's a large calendar, you think?

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** There's a lot on there.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Circular.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Weaving.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** It seems like a lot of the language is in Athlo.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** You aren't quite sure what to make of it.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:13]** Anybody who is either looking at it or besides boom or boom, give me either a perception or a physical science or a mysticism.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** I think those are the three checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** Could you all please, we're guarding this, right?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** Yeah.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** A 27 perception.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Cara, can you take a look at this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** I'm not sure.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** It's written in Aklo.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:32]** But the sketch and calendar of one of the previous CEOs... Oh, wait, no.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** It's not a porn sketch anymore.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** 27 Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** 27 Perception from Kara.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** It's just a calendar.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** So, Kara... Three life signs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** Okay.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** I love that y'all start to kind of... You're resting.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Then you come over.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** You go, Kara.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Boom.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** Maybe each of you sees it at the same time because you all roll pretty high.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** You're like,

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** That date is recent.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** That date's a long time ago, but that date is also recent, like in the past year.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** And you realize that at the intersections of some of these lines...

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:28]** The full meaning of the map is not quite clear, but it's odd that this map calendar has all these dates from here to Mycroft's time, which was close to the gap afterwards, but close to it.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** And you think maybe you're looking, maybe you ask Archie.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:44]** The dates on the map correspond to the dates of the kidnappings that you responded to on Mara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** What are you doing, John?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Do you all see what I see?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:54]** These lines are perfectly with kidnappings on Maro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** We should take this with us.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** What dates are we seeing exactly?

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:01]** Are these the life and death dates of this individual?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** No, that's the full page.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** It's like predictions.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** It's almost like a celestial map of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:26]** It's like a template of like, is somebody recreating it or is somebody like, is this a prediction?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Like what Kevin said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** You think it's predictive.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:35]** Clearly, the lines indicate some sort of trajectory.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Cosmic event.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Less of a cosmic event.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:44]** And you can tell that the scale of the map is large in terms of time.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** But then it zooms into these specific days.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** And that's the amount of granularity that you get.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** Yeah.

**[00:52:52 - 00:53:16]** so it seems like there are it's acknowledging and tracking some sort of uh Force or impression but then it's it zones in on these days as if something is supposed to happen on that day future oh yeah sorry yeah that's the next thing yeah I was gonna say Cecil wants to like run his finger along and see if if there's a date for today and if there's any dates in the future

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:28]** I feel like the four of you have spread it out, and you all started on a different part of the map, and then your fingers start to come together, all four fingers, and there's a date for today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:35]** Yeah, we all look up together like that one part of Scooby-Doo, where they all look at the camera at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Scooby-Doo appears.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** It's actually electric guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Pulled a mask off to Shabbat.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** It's just an old white man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:50]** It's actually the mayor of Mar-a-Lago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:53]** I would have got away with it too if it wasn't for you kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** There's a date for today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** What does it say?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Oh, no.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** These are just days with no descriptions.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** So you're standing in this hidden library.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:10]** You've taken out the threat of a Shabbat who is told to hold you off for as long as possible.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** You have discovered that there is a lot of history here.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:27]** about Ringworks, about the building, about some of its founders, including this Mycroft Black and some calendar map kept in their books.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:36]** And then you, maybe, Kara, you remember there's a large safe door off to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:42]** Is there a door up here up the stairs into the right once you're up there next to the Shabbat?

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** No.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Can't click it.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Nope.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Okay.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** It looks like a door, but it's not.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** So this is like a dead-end room.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** It's just a big warehouse.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** And then there's the vault.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** All right.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** I think the only way forward is through that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Agreed.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Let's see if we can unlock together.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:00]** But if not, I have Thrusty back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** And he, like, hits his little preacher gun.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:29]** but um he folds up the map uh the calendar puts it in his coat pocket and starts to make it i'll break out my laser drill oh yeah can team up on the laser drill that's cool can i use i mean i'm assuming like maybe the uh this vaults like single forge construction in some places like can i use my electro location yeah i'd say you could definitely


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:31 - 00:56:01]** let's take a look where a laser drill can create a whole one inch in diameter and one inch deep you same time yeah you see exactly where a lot of the bolts are going from the door into the surrounding wall and you are able to identify those weak points around it and you're a smart cookie you know if you make this cut here this cut here this cut here the door might be able to open


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:23]** a cutter just like old oh wait no i'm not talking who's doing this cecil right he's still in car okay right oh i wanted to help out too or can boom take out his like little i think uh this might be the linchpin here if we just uh snip snip so with his like puncher thing so not the laser drill


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** We're all working together.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** He just wants to participate.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Let him do it.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:33]** I'm not yucking your... I know.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** I'm not talking to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** Is this door made out of concrete, plastic, or wood?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Because it does not say metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Right.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:51]** So if you go to the hardness on 408, 411, that's what I used last time you guys were punching through the wood door.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Where's that hardness?

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:19]** materials uh let's see uh there was i thought i had here that it was 15 so it's stone it's fine you're able to get through it with your uh it's hardest of 15 or less yes the laser drill yes okay all right yeah just just saying i know because rules are important okay thank you kevin

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** So you're able to get through.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** I like the idea of Kara and Cecil doing this together.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:32]** And then Boom's like, it's like we trained for this kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Yeah.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** We are professional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Love it.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** how does the door fall off?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** Well, where does it fall off?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Does it swing?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:49]** Where did the linchpin like, where do you try and open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:54]** I'm assuming it's around like the latch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** So it, so it'll swing off.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Yeah.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Cool.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** Takes a minute or two, but you all are skilled.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** You've done this in training a bunch of times.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:29]** and it slides you can you can feel the floor as because you've cut it in some places the hinge is a little unbalanced suddenly and the front end scrapes a little bit and you you push it open and you see that there is a

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:37]** Small room with a little shelf on the side and another staircase that descends further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:44]** Cecil kind of shimmies his way forward and he pulls out his tactical pike in one arm.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:50]** And as he's putting his drill away, he says to Kara, that was a lot easier than training.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Maybe too easy.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** And he's going to head down the stairs.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** Taking point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Okay.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** What's everyone else doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:01]** Boom equips his pulse staccato rifle now and follows right behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Squad machine gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:10]** Kara's going to pull out the tack lash and compliance ray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Ooh.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** The old trusty whip.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** I like it.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** What's Migo doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:20]** Migo is covering six with his hammer.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Love it.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** He likes to be all the way in the fray.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:26]** Again.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:47]** quietly you hear the sounds of your own feet but as you're descending you realize you are you are deep getting deeper and deeper under maro's surface

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:53]** There's an intermittent as the signal keeps trying to catch from Archie.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** It's still there.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:58]** You all can talk locally to each other, but the signal is becoming a little weak from Archie.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:07]** The walls and the ceiling are silent under the pressure of just acutons, clay, thousands of feet of it above you.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** It starts to spiral down.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:13]** There's a small landing every 10 or so steps with a left turn.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:23]** And then you also start to notice this like... Thrum.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Maybe you think it's in your head.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:28]** And then you reach out.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** You can feel barely perceptible vibration.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:35]** Kara, especially with your electrolocation, if you test that...

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** There are small lights that illuminate each step.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Those flicker sometimes with that hum.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]** So for a brief second, sometimes you think you can't quite see the step in front of you and then it comes back.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:58]** If any of you have apprehensive about tight spaces, you certainly begin to feel uneasy in your gut, even when they're training.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:06]** So step after... Is this the same thrumming that Boom heard with his...

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** No, that was different.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:11]** You think that that thrumming came from the statue.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:15]** Yeah, the prophetic statue there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** This is new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** This is a new thrumming.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:24]** After a while, there's just the thrum, your footsteps, and the air around you as you descend.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** The air's also getting hotter.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** You're starting to breathe.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:35]** Sweat's starting to build under your suits and in your masks.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:44]** If you're wearing any masks and you think, man, this is getting real hot.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:51]** Maybe you take off a glove as you're walking slowly, switching weapons because your hands are getting sweaty.

**[01:01:52 - 01:02:02]** Then the light starts to just, the light level raises a little bit as a soft orange hue until you stop.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:12]** right before a landing, and you realize that around the left, there's a source of orange light.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** The staircase ends around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:22]** And that is our game.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** Knew it.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Is this where we finally are?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** I don't know.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** Listen in next week to Roll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** And Kelly says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Until next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** What do you want me to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** You always have to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** You have to do it as boom.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** You have to do it as boom.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** What's waiting for you?

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:44]** Yeah, like, yeah, we'll say it.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** Yeah, we'll say it.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** See you later, Scotty.
