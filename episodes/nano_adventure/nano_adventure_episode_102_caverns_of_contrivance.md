## Speaker_0

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** We would like to formally apologize for these 30 seconds.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Can you, like, open your mouth when you eat, please?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Be polite so we can hear it.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** You want me to be impolite?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, open your mouth.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** I'm sure with the class.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** No, I was just trying.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** It definitely tastes like artificial Dr. Pepper.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** It's like the Dr. Pepper jelly beans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** As opposed to what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** To naturally occurring Dr. Pepper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** The stuff that grows on the plants in the wild.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Naturally.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** It's the Willy Wonka.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** But it wasn't like exactly Dr. Pepper.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:07]** And I can tell you that because I have my cup of Dr. Pepper here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:12]** It's probably like the most Dr. Pepper they can make, Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:19]** Can Dr. Pepper do a spoof commercial that is just them, but instead of spice on the planet Arrakis, it's Dr. Pepper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** That is a Dr. Pepper commercial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** That is absolutely a Dr. Pepper commercial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** It would be the sugar off of this peep.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:59]** yeah it would be the spice hold on the doctor pepper spice the dp peeps must flow i also don't know if it's just the outside of the peep that tastes i'll have to eat another one later um but if it's the outside of the peep that tastes like dr pepper or if the entire peep tastes like dr pepper you know like is it is it just a peep coated or a dr pepper flavored coated peep or is it a peep flavored doctor how do you how do you eat your peeps how do i prefer my peeps


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** How do you prefer your peeps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** I prefer my peeps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** How do you partake in your peeps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** I like it when my peeps hang out with me and play Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:14]** Wow.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** That's the love we all need.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Cheers to that, Kevin.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** That was nice.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:28]** I still have the images of, like, Kevin being, like, stranded on a deserted island and just, like, licking, like, Dr. Pepper leaves or something.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Turns out they're from a tree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** Dr. Pepper's a single flavor from a tree in the middle.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Hunting Dr. Pepper peeps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** As it, like, drips into his mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:42]** Finding a nest of DP peeps.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Yeah.

**[00:05:42 - 00:06:08]** have you guys ever played chubby bunny no yeah no yeah yeah i have should i i'm afraid it's like it's a dangerous game i'm not gonna google it i could literally die yeah you could so it was should i google it it's it's a perfectly innocent so kids at home don't try this i wouldn't recommend it but it's perfectly innocent chubby bunny you take a marshmallow and you put it in your mouth and you have to say the word chubby bunny chubby bunny


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Oh, I think I've seen that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** And if you do successfully do it, you shove another marshmallow in your mouth.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** Repeat to see how many marshmallows you can shove in your mouth and successfully say Chubby Bunny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** I'm not doing that.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** I see where you're going with this, and I've got a box full.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** I can't believe you guys never tried it.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** It was like a big thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:31]** According to Wikipedia, three people have died.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:53]** choking on marshmallows cases of death three at least all right because like when you think about things you don't want to get stuck in your esophagus marshmallows are up there marshmallows yeah yeah wow yeah it would not clear it out because you've got 26 other marshmallows in your mouth do you need to like just have hot chocolate on there ready to like pour into your face just to mouth like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** That's probably it.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:00]** You just need to be adjacent to a hot chocolate fountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:08]** To remove the marshmallow from your esophagus, you need to inhale this hot chocolate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Like an aerosol.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** Like a hot chocolate aerosol spray.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Emergency spray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Or just like a river.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** That actually sounds really good.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Can we make a hot chocolate spray?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** A little breath freshener.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Super soaker full of hot chocolate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** I'll give you a hint.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** They don't, they don't have daylight savings time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** So it hasn't been saved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Apparently no one does though.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** Apparently this is a very unique American thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Uh, there's a daylight savings there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** It is.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** It is.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** I'm not sure what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Only three countries in the world.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** I'm sorry.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** There are five of them.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:23]** Five?

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** There's only five of these kinds of countries in the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:30]** Are you talking about behind a curtain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** But the curtain's gone, though, isn't it?

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** Can we get clarification on this?

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** I don't think this was ever under the curtain, though, if I'm not mistaken.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** The Iron Curtain.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Yeah, but I don't think that this country ever was.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Maybe it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** That's an interesting clue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:54]** Everyone here already knows because they're smart enough to figure it out and or have a good memory of my mentioning it earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:23]** so yeah you probably you probably talked about it like last week and you sent us photos and then specifics yeah yeah my goal though is like this date drop that you need to drop the pictures in in the general discord because you you dropped it on private and from those clues you said find these clues like i i got i think i got the clue i think yeah but i was trying to find like we can we can we can redact something yeah we know we can just remove the audio but

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** I won't say anything, but you're at a bar.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** It's clearly what the picture's at.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** You're at some kind of bar on a beach.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** On the beach.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:38]** My goal was to find that bar.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** Stroll down the street and be like, oh, look for the hideout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** I want to see that too, actually.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** I still need some time to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** That's going to be me before I go to bed.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Just me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:57]** The clue is... I'm going to find... We've got to find an open security camera somewhere nearby.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:04]** You know how they have that you can browse just open publicly on security cameras?

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** There's got to be one.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** There's got to be one.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Come on, you know.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Nearby.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** You can catch Kelly on a surf camera.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Especially in a... There's enough Samsung hardware around there.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:19]** When you live in one of the five kinds of countries this is, or whatever, then I imagine there are security cameras.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** They make fine watches.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:40]** fine watches they make like clothes that i wear as well but like um uh the the the clue is on the horizon for sure in that video and photo there's something in the background there yeah it's it's not the bar it's not the heineken thing it's something further back

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** It's, oh, it's not the, it's definitely not a figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:56]** It's behind my head, but also, uh, well, I mean in the photo, but like in the one where it's the video, it's not, it's like an on the horizon in front of my face, but we'll got it earlier.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** And we'll notice that we'll notice where it is.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Will is pointing.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I'm pointing.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Okay.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Yeah.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** Bob Dole.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** And the president's subreddit, which I read a lot.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Which president?

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** It's probably a bulls**t post.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** Like a personal sub-president?

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** What would Bob Dole have won if Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself?

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Sorry, that sounds kind of dark, but it's also kind of funny.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** What the heck?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** I don't know why that's related, and I want to find out.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** More questions.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** The person who does my favorite Bob Dylan impression, Norm Macdonald.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Oh yeah, I remember that.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** I remember those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** I don't know if I would know a Bob Dylan impression if I saw one.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** I feel like that's just Norm Macdonald talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:55]** Yeah, basically.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:03]** Speaking of sentences, I think we should roll into... Do we have a write-in sentence?

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** Okay, I got the sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** I want to be the one.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** I never have been.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** I want to be the very best.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** You never have been.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** Okay, I'm going to message this person on Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:31]** I guess I should open Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** I'm easily distracted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:38]** Yeah, we should all make sure we have our messages open in case.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Yeah.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** But who can say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Okay.

**[00:13:43 - 00:14:12]** what you say it has been messaged to that person it has been messaged to that person and it is time to play all right let's do this i clapped again to to mark thank you thank you for that that was very good i'm gonna take a shot because we are real close some might even call it possibly at a finale and i'm nervous just finished my tasty alcohol yeah go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:18]** No, I might at some point go on the banana phone and then order a coffee.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** But I'll do it discreetly.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** But you might see a banana phone.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Banana phone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Does it say ring, ring, ring, ring?

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Banana phone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** No, it probably makes one of those... It does.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Someone better call me on it so I know.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:56]** well if i feel like that concept is like 15 if you find where out kelly is then just give us your room number so if we find the right hotel we can call exactly my room number is 502 502 okay noted yeah all right y'all this is gonna be exciting you're actually gonna get a call from one of our fans i really really hope so

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** I really hope so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:06]** So in the picture you sent, is that your balcony or is that just a bar around?

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Or is that pointing to the hotel you're staying in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** No, no.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** I'm right across the street from that, basically.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Okay.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Yeah, more or less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:25]** So if we find this location with the Heineken sign, you are across the street from that, away from the water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** I'm not quite across the street.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** I'm like the next street over a little further south.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** So I'm like... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** So I'm just going to call five hotels and ask for 502.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** You should just find the bar.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** If you can find the bar, I'd be impressed.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Are you going to be at the bar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** We'll call the bar when you're at the bar.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Enough interruptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** If you get the city, I'd be impressed.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** That's me.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:55]** Why am I... I shouldn't give it away.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** I think I found it.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** You're at the final bend.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** On the staircase.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Deep in the Morrow cliffside.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:11]** You have conquered IFF agents in the maze of the corporate office.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** You have deduced the trick.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** The orifice.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Shut up.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:22]** You have deduced the trick behind the secret door in the orifice.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:27]** You have bested Malarash, the well-known mercenary.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:34]** And you have found out more about the history of Ringworks and this facility.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** And now you wait.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** That is final secret.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** Ah.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** I'm excited.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Step after step, you walked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Wait, what?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** I didn't hear it.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Wait, what did I miss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:55]** Worst.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:55]** Wait, what did Kevin do?

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** He said chubby bunny right as I started it.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** I missed it.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** That's 100% the thumbnail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:10]** That's it.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** Absolutely.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Sorry, I couldn't help it.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:18]** I just smelt the Dr. Pepper powder and I had to eat one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:26]** You smelt the Dr. Pepper powder and that caused you to evacuate your... The Dr. Pepper spice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** Oh, man.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Thanks, Kev.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:40]** Step after step, the only sound is your footsteps and this... ...thrum as you descend.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** The air was getting hotter and denser.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:49]** The sweat is beginning to build under your suits and in your masks, if you have any on.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:57]** The light is beginning to fill around you with a soft orange ambient hue until you come to the last landing.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** Speaking of that, I did want to put on... Hang on, hang on.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** But you said you just said mass.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** It seems like the staircase ends around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Like it goes to nothing?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** What?

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** What are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Wrangle it in, guys.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** What are you thinking?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** What is your character thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:36]** Cecil would throw on his environmental protections, and you gave us some kind of special mask thing in our... Enviro-mask, which I'm assuming that works on top of your environmental protections.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** So this seems like a good time to put that on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** If you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:55]** yeah okay yeah why not yeah that's a good it's a good idea yeah it's best to go in prepared sorry i thought you were finished john that's why i said it uh-huh yeah it's okay it's cool yeah just interrupt me uh so yeah what are you all thinking as you're about to turn the corner here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:08]** So Migo is keeping an eye on his, I assume, wrist screen, sort of like NFL quarterbacks wear, to make sure that we're tracking toward the emergency beacon.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:18]** And I think he's nervously excited because this is, you know, these captors have eluded him and the Stars team for so long.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:23]** Having another shot to close this loop.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Yeah.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** You know, he's a doer and he's a closer.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** And so he wants to, he wants to get done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** The beacon is very close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:46]** I think along those same lines is like Cecil is just so laser focused on getting into this next room and, and, you know, taking out any hostiles.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** So he's, he's in the front of the pack.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:59]** He's, you know, he's got his pike, but he puts it over his shoulder and you see him kind of just draw the nanites out and form back into his pulse caster rifle.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:05]** And he's, he's just prepped to, to, you know, break into that next room and get to the action.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Kara.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Boom.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Yeah.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:22]** Kara is very, very pumped to get into the room and get this solved and like to clean up the streets and this menace.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** She wants to get to the bottom of this.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** She's hoping it's like around the next corner and that it's,

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:39]** But she's also kind of reckless in that she wants it so bad for this to be a fight that she can win on her own.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** On her own?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** What do you mean?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:49]** Well, not on her own, but leading the team collectively on our own.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** I like it.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** She wants these stars to align.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:05]** Boom being the consummate professional that he is, is, you know, just sort of like you see like...

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:32]** as he takes as he puffs in the darkness like the embers glow and his eyes like look like concerned over it at cecil to make sure that he's doing okay because he knows that he was nervous earlier you know what i mean and then he but he's not worried um and he tries not to get too caught up in theories about what's happening he has his gun trained forward the he's ready for action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:57]** okay keeping hit in game and what's the order that you all are in i have uh cecil i think and then cara and then migo and then boom i know someone else is at the back it's not boom yeah i thought migo was at the back yeah and then archie's behind migo yeah okay archie's dead right archie fizzled out crashed wait what what are you talking about


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** In my notes, it said Archie's connection is cutting out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** So I'm assuming it's like a... That's a lot of assuming that you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** Wait, are you just on purpose taking bad notes so that you don't have to take them anymore?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Because no one else... I don't remember that ever happening.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** He's not shorting out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** It says Archie's connection is cutting out.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Right.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Yeah.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** It's cutting out.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:23]** And so Archie's just running into walls at this point because it's not getting... Archie can act on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** It's like a glitch.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:30]** I mean, I imagine Archie's navigation is on board processing where external information is probably... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** I don't have enough details on this drone.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Archie seems... Commander Bolton Mechanic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:40]** Archie seems like, reminds me of the thing that turns sort of evil in Halo.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** But then, like, what's that thing called?

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** The little, like, floating ball robot.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I don't know why I can't remember.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** The key?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** The key?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** The key?

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** No.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** The cartographer?

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** The cartographer, yeah, I think.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** After Ghost and Destiny.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** That was my thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Oh, yeah, it's the same idea.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** It's almost like Destiny is terrible and completely steals everything from every other game.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** It's a f***ing Destiny.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** It's a terrible game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:07]** And with that... I think Kelly likes it when I rant because it makes Fizz rant.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:15]** With that thought in mind, in Boom's mind of watching Destiny, it's a horrible game.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** I think Cecil... So much potential.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** You go in.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** Let's do this.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** I'm going to read what you all see.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:33]** Give me a sec to get through it and to get through some other things, and then I will bring you to a map.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:39]** As you step in, you see a massive space open up before you.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** You walk through a portal.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:54]** onto a platform and you see around you the industrial setting of huge pipes and conduits running hundreds of feet up.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:02]** And when you follow them looking down, you see that they run hundreds and hundreds of feet below.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:14]** ending at the source of the orange glow, a massive source of geothermal energy far below waiting to be tapped.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:20]** If you recall, this was a geothermal plant at one point.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:29]** Looking ahead, you see that the concrete floor gives way to a metal and stone platform directly in front of you.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:35]** There are steps that lead up to a small control center on your right.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:51]** And at the other end of the metallic platform in the center sits a large, wise metal ring, 30 feet in diameter, constructed of material at least 150 years old, if not more.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:57]** Steps lead up to the aperture, the ring.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** There are small lights that dot the circumference.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:08]** In front of you are two VESC IFF agents.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** And you can see a Yosuke sitting in the control platform.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:30]** And then, as I bring you to the map, you can see, standing directly in front of you, her arms open and a smile on her face is Leora Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:34]** I knew it this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** I have brought you to the map.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** A halo.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** Welcome, S.T.A.R.S.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** team.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Perfect.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** You have arrived just in time.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** This is perfect.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** You've done an excellent job getting here.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** I knew you would.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Step in.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:52]** Step in.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** How did... Explain the meaning of this.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** We will get there.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** We've got a few words to get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** I understand.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** I've got a monologue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Please wait.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** I've got a monologue.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** I have so much to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** There's an unskippable cutscene we need to get through first.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** I do have to ask you a question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Before we start, how did you find the new offices?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** They're great.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** They were right where they were on the map.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** But they're exquisite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** No, they're excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** They're not my taste.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:32]** It was very, very colorless, I think, comparatively.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** I hate the color gray.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** It's bland and it's used everywhere around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:41]** Well, these jabs, I'm sure, are warranted given the circumstances that you're in.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:49]** Had to come down here, but could we maybe just lower the guns or just keep them a little less aggressively?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:56]** I thought it was really clever you had your office there and where you live just, like, in the same sort of structure.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** I thought that was also very tasteful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Super classy.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** Must help with that work-life balance.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** It really does.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** It's part of the Ringwoods design.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** I didn't see a bed where, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** So, like, you actually live there?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Well, there's a bed in a separate room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** I thought maybe there was a Murphy bed behind one of the bookcases or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:22]** Cecil, I know that you've come on some hard times before, so I don't want to assume.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Look, I will... Can I sense motive on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** Is that like a dig or is that just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:34]** You don't need sense motive to know that that is both a dig and a nod to her having done her research on who you all are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Okay.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** That's immediately Migo flips the switch to fuck her.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Wait, are you going to interrupt her monologue?

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** You don't talk shit about the stars to me.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** Are you just going to like... We're talking.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:57]** In her comment about lowering the guns, Migo lowers his gun and fires up the hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:25]** I think Cecil at first pulls the gun in tighter and then sees Migo do that and he kind of does the same thing he drops the gun and it kind of melts back into his arm but he reaches back and he's got a hand on his pike you better watch your mouth maybe we got off on the wrong foot look there are apologies in order we couldn't meet at your gala


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** It wasn't meant to be.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** But I'm sorry.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:32]** I would have loved to meet you there and celebrate you.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:35]** And in a way, I'm celebrating you here and now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Where are the hostages?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** One sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** And she takes the emergency beacon and just throws it over the side.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** And it falls down.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** And you lose it.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Migo?

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** I'll get there.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** They are... safe.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:04]** Let me keep this little spiel short, but there's a reason you need to listen, okay?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** Let me build a narrative in your head.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:12]** The world that each of you has weathered is cruel.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** It is stolen from you.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** It is threatened constantly.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:25]** To usurp your peace, your security, your reason, your friends, your family, your mother.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Looks at you, Kara.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Your very body.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** You feel it.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:34]** Twisting at you, blinding you, even now.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:38]** Making choices for you, even when you think that you're in control.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** And I can see its scars on every one of you.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** It is a thorn in the eye of creation and civilization.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:55]** Maybe you have done your research, but this world also plagued Mycroft Black.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** a fugitive Vesk during the silent war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:11]** He found a home here with us at Ringworks and eventually sought a personal mission to bring peace to the Pact Worlds.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:21]** But when he returned from the future with the roadmap to that peace, many were angry, jealous, doubtful, spiteful, twisted by this cruel world.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** That's where it is.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** And they hated him for it.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:31]** So they gathered together and they took him from us, but not before he preserved what he could.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** And this is where you come in.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** Imagine if your memories left a physical impression.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** She starts to pace back and forth like it's a TED Talk.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** A measurable impression in your body.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:51]** And that we could store these impressions, recall them into a new body long after you're gone.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Give them a new life.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** That's what Mycroft discovered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** While she's talking, Bego turns to Kari's like, you buying this shit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:10]** Kari's just looking straight at this, like, she's trying to preserve her poker face for Leora.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:35]** boom boom's also trying to do that but he's looking at his watch because this is like the seventh time this has happened to the stars team like where they've had like some maniac like go on a monologue and he kind of like looks at car like really annoyed like we won't be any breaking any records yet but uh don't hold your breath yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:42]** If you share the memories from the right people, the right history, progress becomes a reaction and the nanites a catalyst.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:52]** You place them in the right body and your pace towards utopia is accelerated as that new individual brings long lost knowledge.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:57]** This is what we are working on to carry on this link.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:01]** Only this, this, this next link, I can't quite get it right.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:10]** None of the others that I kidnapped, none of the other experts, none of the similar test subjects, they didn't have the skills needed to withstand processing, to handle the infusion.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** If I could, I would.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** But my destiny is nothing compared to yours.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Your bodies have this.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** And that experience is in your nanopods.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:28]** The nanobots in the four of you contain the collective memories of Mycroft Black.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:44]** You four have, as intended when we gave them to you, contributed to his memories with your own over the past year, folding in your skills, expertise, and knowledge, the perfect link in the chain to his work.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** No one else was more perfect.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** The real reason you are here?

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** You are the conduit for this change.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** Of course, what can I offer you?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** You look incredulous.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** You've heard this before.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** You've heard this offer.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** You've heard this understanding.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Understand that you have a choice before you.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:18]** The right decision means that your loved ones, those who are still under the press of this world, will be compensated, celebrated splendidly for the death of their hero.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** They will be looked after in perpetuity.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** They will no longer have to fight Kara.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:30]** Your mother becomes the leader of an Akatonian effort to rehabilitate those in need of a straight path.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:38]** Migo, your research will help advance the team who develops a cure for the Brathedon Blight.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:44]** Boom, your inventions will move explosive safety research by decades.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:49]** And posthumously, you become the spokesperson for a packed world cigar brand.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:54]** Cecil, she looks at you with kind of a soft eye.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Cecil, your children grow beyond your imagination to become people.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** You keep my children out of your mouth, lady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** That you never thought they could be.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** Spreading light to the darkest corners of the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** It's a good thing, Cecil.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:18]** You see, the four of you, you will grow into the collective embodiment of Mycroft Black as your bodies died.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** But your memories live on.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** The foundation for the future.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** Remember, you get what you give.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** The decision before you now is not about you.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** It's about the future.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** All you have to do is walk through that gate.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** And she points behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Well, it was under time limit.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** I have seen before.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** What time did you put it at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** Six out of ten for originality, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:58]** I had it for 30 seconds, but I know that was... Who was tracking how long that speech took?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** I tracked.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** It was like four and a half minutes.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** I had 358.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I took the over on that one.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** Well, I included, like, this small interruption earlier.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** I think... Yeah, I guess I'm buying drinks after this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:16]** You are aware that if you refuse, your family gets none of that.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, whatever you say.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** What are you promising exactly?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:37]** devote your body contribute it so that way we can take your nanites to bring about a utopian future and your family your loved ones will be looked after in perpetuity if you don't

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** She holds up this small rectangular device.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:51]** Your memories, your existence, and their memories of you will be modified, removed, from everyone and every record that you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Carrie, you mind if I do the honors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** Suppose I say yes to your what happens next.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Again.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** What do you mean?

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** You walk through the gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Oh, just walk through the gate?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** What gate?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** The gate that's been here the whole time.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** The gate at the end of the platform.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** It's like the gate, though, in Harry Potter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** You walk through and you die.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** Right, the sheet that Sirius Black ended up in.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Exactly.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Spoiler alert for those stuck in.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Rude.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** I didn't know that.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** That's not true.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** I totally knew that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** So this platform here is like we are on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** It's like a reclamator for our nanites.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:58]** much what is this we need more than that this here is well as i'm sure you found out sometimes the stewards don't look after their old technology this is the steward gates oh this is a thing that they used to bounce around from an early steward's base that was here that was part of the research that you had determined back up in the library was that this used to be a steward's base a long time ago


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** And they would use these, like, portals to move around quickly, allegedly, right?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Like, between place to place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Allegedly, they still do.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** So she wants us to... How does that lead to... She modified it, I guess?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** What she's talking... Yeah.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Is she modifying it?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Like, what is this?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:17]** What is this perverse experiment you have got concocted here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** It's just a gate.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:25]** Where it leads, that's where you will make your final contribution, let's say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** This reminds me of Westworld.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** What?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:33]** I don't want to do any spoilers, but the whole end of season two... I've never seen it.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** I haven't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** I haven't seen Stargate.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** It's a little bit like that, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** But I'm just thinking our bodies are going to pass through the gate.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** Yeah, you just hope the gate is open on the other side.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** And then our bodies are going to fall into the pit.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:50]** Like, it's just taking the information out of us and then destroying our body.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Not that I'm going to pass through that willingly.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** I think during all this, I...

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Cecil's going to look at Archie.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Can I do a perception check on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** Is Archie showing Bolt's face or anything?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** No.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** Archie's cameras are just looking forward at Leora and then looking back at the two of you.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Just taking in the whole situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:17]** Cecil's going to look directly at Archie knowing that Bolt's on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:39]** did you know this were you involved you don't hear anything coming through who was the person monitoring the taps up at the server side up in the office that was yeah that was that was cara cara you do get a ping as this is happening a notification of movement in the lobby

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Maybe you look down real quick.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:48]** You see a little feed of the room that leads into the waiting area.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:56]** And you see what looks like a Raxalite and ten armored Morrow strike team members walking through.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Moving from the main executive lobby.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** Starting to head down the path that you were going through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Morrow, sorry, say it again?

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Morrow strike team?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Strike team.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Yeah, just kind of the...

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** Not as advanced as you all, but support.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** Support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** And the Raxxlite... Was that the Lieutenant?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** Was the Lieutenant a little Raxxlite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** That's the Raxxlite you're the best friends with unless there's something else in your backstory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:30]** So, Kara, maybe you can be the one to teach the truth to the other three.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** So, Kara's going to start inching forward.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:38]** So, if I just step through this...

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** This gate here?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Do you keep walking?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** What happens?

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Yeah, she's going to, like, walk.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:50]** She's going to distance herself from, like, Leora and sort of stall, like, getting into a position away.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:58]** But, like, where's, like, the safe minimum distance between this thing and myself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** You think that it's probably at the stairs, maybe?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** You really can't tell, though.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Not sure what it can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:18]** She's going to keep asking questions, getting Leora to talk as she approaches the stairs.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Okay.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** And what are you trying to do here?

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** You trying to bluff?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** You trying to hide something?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Yeah, it's a bluff.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Okay.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Give me a bluff check.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** What are you trying to bluff doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Just like the whole thing?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:35]** No, I mean, I'm just trying to, like, get her off guard.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** A diversion, I guess.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Maybe for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** She starts to follow you.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Give me a bluff check.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** But she walks a little bit behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Bluff check.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Here we go.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** That is a 23.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Migo, your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:01]** So is this part of the stars playbook or is this like off script?

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Kara's improvising.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Kara's improvising.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** I mean, I've read that whole playbook and this ain't in it.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Of course, Cecil has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** Boom is the second most senior person here and has seen Kara do many things.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** So Boom is just calmly like folding his arms.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** He knows what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:21]** Liara steps up next to you and says, Kara, just quietly, kind of to you, talk to me.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** What are you thinking?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** The last time that I saw you like this, it wasn't quite right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** I don't understand how it's all supposed to come about.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** How you're supposed to just change this place overnight.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** There's nothing to change.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** The only thing you need to worry about is yourself.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** You can be the one to show them that this is okay.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** That this is acceptable.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Acceptable for what?

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:49]** For the good of the rest of the past worlds.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** How?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** You know.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** You know how.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** Carl, what's she talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** It doesn't make any sense.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** And you start to walk back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Okay.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** I think Cecil's going to take a sidestep.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:26]** like try to sneak a sidestep towards boom to fill that gap that car made yeah i mean you can yeah he's gonna he's gonna whisper over to the the two and say like we need to take out that guy the control panel yeah for sure don't don't worry we will and then boom like plays up like cars oh no cara don't do it it's not worth it we love you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:32]** I don't want to mess your car up.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** I've seen this routine before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:46]** So what are you doing?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:49]** Come.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** Let's just go ahead and get this thing running, shall we?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** And she looks over to the Yusuke and nods.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** And then there's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** What is Leora?

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** She's holding this box?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** No, she's not holding a box.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** She held up that box.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** She did hold up a box on her person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** Could I attempt when she was trying to fluff?

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** If you want to try and steal it from her?

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:26]** It's still in her hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** It's not in her hand.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** She has put it back on her person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Sorry, say that one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** It's back on her person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:40]** Look, I may... It seems like there's some hesitation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:49]** I just don't understand what you're... How is this supposed to just change things overnight for the people in our lives?

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** There's too much pain and hurt in this place.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** We can do a lot of things, Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** We really can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** And we have the support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Sick of your snake oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Yeah, alright.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:03]** I guess we'll see what this thing is about when the ghost starts walking toward the portal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Migo starts walking towards the portal.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** Wait, wait.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Migo, don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** Look, I may, I don't want to compel you.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** I may have to.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** So, boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** Cecil, can we just have you come on as well?

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:26]** It seems like two of your crew members have already agreed that this is of an interest to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** When Migo gets to here, he says, actually, Leora Huxley, you're under arrest.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:36]** And pulls out his binders to restrain her wrists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** Boom reaches into his cheek and pulls out a grenade.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** It's all wet and soppy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** You can do this on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** I will.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Well, it's ready, okay.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Roll.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:59]** Let me go and add you all to this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:04]** You know, you showed us how to add our own initiative, and I don't remember how to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** You have to, like, hit roll.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Yeah, you click on the dice.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Or the die.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** The die.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** It will come up.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:16]** You should be able to type in the number that you rolled yourself, and then go from there.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:41]** oh leora looks mom baby looks evil in this picture of her so she's a human or she's a she's a hilkey but she looks like demonic and her armor is is i don't know if it actually did it correctly or not mine certainly didn't i did not get a 41.01 that is weird because i definitely added in your thing but maybe i can update it i think you added it i just didn't do it right

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Oh, okay.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** I'm not sure if any of this is correct.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Well, let's just walk through it real quick.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** So, Migo, what did you get for your initiative?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Dirty 20.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Dirty 20.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Okay.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Sounds good.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** What did you get, Kara Valtara?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** Kara also got a dirty 20.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:03]** Ooh, who has the higher initiative between you and Migo?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Plus three.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Plus three.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** What about you, Migo?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Migo?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Oh, Migo left.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** No.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:34]** amazing uh i think let me let me just go check in the uh here lab it is it's definitely you cara so i'm gonna put 21 it's gonna be me boom 21 17 17 what'd you get i got a 17 as well but i was okay

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** Well, I think, boom, you probably have the higher dex.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** Let's check.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** That's probably why you are already at 17.01.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Let's see.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** Your dex is plus one.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:47]** And your dex, Officer Remy Cecil, is plus zero.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** So, yeah, makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:52]** That's why I can stick landings, unlike our dear Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Rude.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** Just a little bit extra dexterous.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Dexterity.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Did we lose Vinny?

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Super duper rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** He just like walked off set without saying anything.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** Yeah, I don't know where Vinny went.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** What if he's getting murdered?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** What?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Vinny, are you still alive?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** What?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** Show us a sign of life.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** Vinny, can you hear us?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Why would he be getting murdered?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** That's great.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** I don't know.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:14]** It's like maybe he had a knock on his door and he went to answer it and there was somebody...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:19]** Or, like, maybe there was a swamp puppy that leapt out from the Everglades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** He's back.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** It's cool.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** There was no IFF agent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:27]** He was going to pop up on our VTT as a token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** IFF?

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Yeah.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Like, what is IFF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Something Futurefront.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** The Integrated Futurefront.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** It's the cult group that you've been fighting this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:47]** So I was saying, Leora, if this image of Leora is legitimate, she looks pale for a Hilki.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** And she looks almost demonic-ish.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** And then her armor is plate armor, like layered plate armor.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Something you'd see in medieval times.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** And not at medieval times, the place, but in medieval times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** Not at medieval times.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** I've seen it.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** I've seen this.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Thank you for that.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** That was pretty.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** Thank you for that.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** That was, that was much needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** I'm really glad that you said that.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:16]** But it's also, it's, it's like, it's, it's brushed with purple kind of from the center.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Is that a valid description?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Well, it kind of, sure.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** It kind of looks like a bone structure too.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:29]** Like the way it's laid out, it's like, it's almost like a, yeah, it's something like the horde from, from like, wow, which I've never played before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Okay.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** So, you know, it's a lovely boost here.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** Let's let combat begin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** So, Migo, you walked up and said, what?

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Leora, you're under arrest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** You all chose the hard path.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** I'm sorry.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Listen, I don't know about no hard path, but I like your outfit.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** This has got to end.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Thank you.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** I appreciate that.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** You've always looked great yourself.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Thanks, I try.

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:19]** just like brushing each other's hair like you know that was great thank you for that she turns from you Migo and just starts to move 20 feet back towards the steps

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** Either Kara or Migo, if you have a melee weapon ready, you can make an attack of opportunity.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** It's the first round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** Didn't Migo have the hammer ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Migo did have the hammer round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** But I have not taken action in this combat and I don't have an attack of opportunity.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:42]** Our adult friend Finder would be very upset if I took an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** It is true that Finder is the most adult among us.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** He really would.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** He really would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** It's because he doesn't like Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, he doesn't like Pokemon.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** He nags us.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** No, I mean, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:59]** Is not drawing your binders an action enough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** You know where she walks?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** She actually walks straight ahead.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:07]** Towards Boom and Cecil.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** I imagine she struts.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Yeah, it's confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Cecil, I need you to give me a will save.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** We'll save.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** We'll save.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** We'll save.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** I see 42.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** Yeah, we slept on that one.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** Seven total.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Seven.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** That's what I do.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:35]** You feel this, like, shiver come over your body.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** You can't quite place why you feel it.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** But it's uncomfortable.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:45]** And she turns around to Kara and says, you're responsible for this.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** And that's going to be Leora Huxley's turn.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** It is the Yosuke's turn up at the control panel.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** They are going to do what they're going to do.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Kara Valtara, it is your turn.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** What are you doing?

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** First round of combat.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** Kara and Migo are closer to the gate.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:11]** Leora's in the middle with two Vest IFF guards kind of near her, flanking her.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Archie, boom.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Cecil, closer to the entrance.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** What are you going to do, Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** Just to be clear, she's doing some sort of magic, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** She is doing some sort of special ability.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:33]** And all I would have to do... Can I... I guess I would have to roll Mysticism to kind of understand that.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Go ahead.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Okay.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** I'll roll Mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** I'm sort of rated... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** 18.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** You have seen a lot.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:42]** You got what?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:42]** 18?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** 18.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** 18.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** Okay.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:47]** There's something about...

**[00:51:48 - 00:52:03]** Her hands, for a brief second, kind of a bunch of colors that look very similar to the drift kind of just came off of her fingertips and just started to move in these lines that are like right angles.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Do, do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:09]** as it's following graph paper down to the floor.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:21]** You think that this is some sort of precog ability and it has something to do with planar or drift beyond your understanding.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** I don't like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** I don't like this at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:36]** Yeah, Kara is going to be like, I don't know what sort of drift, precognitive witchcraft you're dealing with, Leora, but I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** But I like your hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:43]** But your outfit is smashing.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Slay queen.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** No, but actually, like... Again, Kara, you've always looked incredible.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** I really do like the outfit.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I'm so sorry about this.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** I mean, it's pretty sweet looking armor.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** Again.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** It looks like an exoskeleton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** Dude, she has style.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:01]** She's like the f***ing CEO of this whole spot and is tied into the culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** She's Rome tailored.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** What are you doing besides lavishing compliments on her?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:13]** I'm going to... Can I also just say that I like that you are?

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:16]** Because there is a little bit of like a familiarity between you and her.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Like, you've like...

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** You've come up kind of from the same spots.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** She knows who you are.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:26]** I like the role play.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** What do you think about doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** You guys actually knew each other in middle school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:53]** yeah actually like do i can i like i don't know i guess it's like it's it's what was one of you like a mean girl yes it's for sure it's all revenge it's all a revenge thing can like can i gather information from her using a diplomacy check

**[00:53:53 - 00:54:11]** maybe like yeah so you're listen can we just like talk about what's going on here with this nonsense before this gets physical and she holds up like her tack lash and i don't want to have to use this make a make a diplomacy check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** What is my diplomacy check against?

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** I got to look up to see what diplomacy is against.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Change attitude.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Is it change attitude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:27]** I think you have to spend a stupid amount of time doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** I'm literally just trying to gather information.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** About what?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:38]** Like, what craziness has led her to this and how to defeat her for it?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** What is her Achilles' heel?

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Of course.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:48]** What does she really struggle with day to day in her demonic worship?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** She just needs a friend.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:54]** She's surrounded by vesks all day that don't get her because they don't have fabulous hair.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** And you come up.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** They don't have hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** They don't have hair.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Yeah.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** They're just jealous of her.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** Yep.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:11]** You do recall that she is both of Morrow and clearly has changed.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:18]** So however you might have known her before, she has gone on to study at the Singularity Conservatory.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:26]** She has clearly been a part of some sort of, you know, like just in the corporate world of Ringworks.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** You don't just end up being the CEO here.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** You've changed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:44]** you've betrayed your roots kind of like boom like he left maro but everyone for some reason thinks that's so weird when apparently she can do it and it's fine to just like come back but whatever anyway it's just like it's a common thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:56]** She seems very, she is definitely, clearly a leader in the IFF and is very sworn to this future.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:00]** And she is willing to do just about anything for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:04]** You mean that we can't have like Speech 100 and Skyrim and just completely like talk her out of it?

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** I'm not surprised.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** And she's like, ah, you're right.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** You got me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:13]** I was actually just thinking about how anticlimactic it would be if we came up with a diplomatic solution to this.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** I have prepped for it.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** And I thought you guys would go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Of course you have, John.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** You're the consummate professional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:28]** John's like, these guys' conflict resolution skills are on the next level.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:33]** I need to dial it up a notch when it comes to my rebuttals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** You don't create outcomes.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** You create problems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:43]** When our collective conflict resolution skills is, we should get drunk together and just hang out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** It worked with Frog.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** It did work with Frog.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** It did work with Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Carl, what are you going to do here?

**[00:56:51 - 00:57:19]** you are uh i so yeah she's not receptive to any of this no no she she like it's it is a little weird she is clearly advocating for you to sacrifice your body for the experimentation that's been done on you unbeknownst to you without your consent and she's clearly asking you to do this and yet a part of her is still willing to just talk to you a bit it's yeah it's

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** There's a cognitive dissonance here.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** It's a little unnerving.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:27]** She is a little unnerving, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** She has two lives to keep up.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** At this point...

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** I think it's going to turn violent because she's attacking Cecil, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Yeah.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** You saw her look at Cecil.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** And Cecil, when she looked at you, there was like a pity in her eyes.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Again, with that soft look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Yeah.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** So she's going to hit her with the tack lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Going to hit her with the tack lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:58]** She's going to she's going to try and trip her.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:10]** So, yeah, is the reason I rolled for Mrs. Kind of earlier was to try and figure out, like, if I break her concentration, does that, like, affect what's going on or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:16]** Uh, it's not a spell, I don't think, because concentration only applies to, like, spells.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** And you don't think that this was a concentration that she's trying to keep up.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:27]** She did something, and now she has... Like, you've seen enough spellcasting to know that she is not actively maintaining this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** And she's not currently armed with any sort of item?

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** Or is she just, like, using her hands?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** She is confident as all... She clearly has a weapon on her, but right now, she has bare hands.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** Yeah, I'm going to try and trip her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** You're going to try and trip her.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:45]** That's against KSE plus 8, right?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Because it's a trip maneuver?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** Is that what we figured out?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Just throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** Equip the bare hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:18]** we're an eccentric rich person i mean it's it's her kc plus eight like something crazy though like would i know that like that it's impossible to trip her uh i will just tell you that it's very very hard to trip her like i don't i don't think they're gonna do it dude she she doesn't skip any day she's a leggy she doesn't skip brain day


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** She doesn't get leg day.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** She doesn't get hair day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:26]** For the listeners, today is leg day and I'm hating life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:55]** telling you that will just as like gm the player like like i don't want you to like do an action and be like no i'm not gonna try and do this more than once i'm throwing it out there as the first uh sort of uh salvo you know maneuver and combat okay so let's do it okay no natural 20 natural 20 what's your total what is your total 25 it doesn't work no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** The leggiest of the leggies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** You're saying a natural 20 on a combat maneuver doesn't count as an automatic?

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** No, it's not an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** It's not an attack.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** It's a combat maneuver.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** It's a waste.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** It's a combat maneuver.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:17]** So I go to sweep the leg, and I guess it just ricochets right off of her, and I don't know.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** She doesn't even flinch, I guess, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** Yeah, she just moves her leg.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:26]** It gets wrapped up, and she just moves her leg at the last second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** Leora Huxley, former prima ballerina of the Morrow Ballet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Oh, I see.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:41]** I think a natural 20 does give you... Does a natural 20 make a combat maneuver?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:45]** I'm trying to find it in Starfinder and I don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** I'd be interested to know.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:49]** If it were an attack, that's obviously a hit.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** Regardless of anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** Oh, we're going to ping the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** I kind of like it where she's not tripped now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]** I don't think that she was.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:06]** If for some reason I'm super wrong, maybe she'll just trip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:12]** I mean, if she's a tank dude and her KC is like 20.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** I think a part, yeah.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:20]** 28 is the... Her KC can't be 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:25]** There's a part of you, Kara, that's like, she is formidable.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Very formidable.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** What else do you want to do with your turn, Cara?

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Well, I mean, I already did it all.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** I like it.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Your turn reflected the indecision.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** I'm trying to figure it out.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:41]** I didn't want to necessarily go down this path, but I'm going to try and trip you.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** And then you're like, okay, this is what we're up against.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** I like it.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:49]** Migo, you tried to put the cuffs on and she just strolled away from you.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Not quickly.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** Not in any hurry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** This is a quote.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:58]** I strongly believe the answer is yes, as they are a form of attack.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:01]** And we got a plus up from Leslie.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** Or a finger up from Leslie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:09]** That's our adult friend finder, which means you need to really, really believe what he says.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** He's an adult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** Is combat maneuvers under the attack section?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:19]** I don't think they are attacks because they are modifiers for other people's attacks, typically.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:25]** When you think about combat maneuvers, you've got covering fire, you've got harrowing fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:28]** Combat maneuvers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:35]** It's good to just get bogged down on the first time.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:39]** Why did I even try to do this?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** Does there need to be a vote that goes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** I know.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** It is not under attack.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** It is its own section.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** It is under standard actions.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** I'm going to rule that it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:51 - 01:03:10]** migo what do you do with uh with cars tack lash uh migo interprets that as weapons hot because why the not um migo moves in says all right you didn't want the uh you didn't want the handcuffs let's see how you like the hammer

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** And he just swings for the fences.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** And he swings for the fences.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Give me a swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** That is a 15.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** Do you make a melee attack?

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** Plus 7 for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** I think we should go back.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** I think we should pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:30]** Yeah, I mean... It does say melee attack roll.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** Let's see.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Critical hits.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20, you hit regardless of the target's AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:40]** And it says, in combat maneuver, then make a melee attack roll against KAC plus 8.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** It is a melee attack against the KAC plus 8.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:47]** And we have unanimous yeses from our paralegals.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** You can't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** No, I'm allowed to rule it if I don't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** But false.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Wait, really?

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** No, no, hold on, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** Wait, to change the rules of the game?

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** No, no, no.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** I'm with John on this one.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** GM ruling supersedes even the core rulebook.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:08]** But is that part of the will-safe philosophy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:12]** If you think about the Constitution, what did we mean when we wrote it for will-safe?

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** There's a Constitution?

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** I feel like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** Again, I am a fan of being technically correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:18]** Guys, we're our own country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** We are our own country.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** I am a fan of being technically correct.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:28]** And if that is technical evidence that a standard 20, when you make an attack roll, you automatically hit.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** I mean, I did roll a 20.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:36]** I didn't like saying no, but I didn't have any evidence to say otherwise.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** And I think in that case, it made sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:42]** Listen, I was with you up until a point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:48]** I'm actually coming back around and thinking that you did trip her.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:49]** Really.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** Truly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Grumpus is chiming in.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** I don't know if this will change anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]** I knocked the stone loose that was under her foot.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:02]** I didn't want to have to appeal this to the Supreme Paizo courts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:06]** The question is... That would have gone ugly.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:10]** Don't take somebody to court over a rules interpretation.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** Just don't be that guy.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]** Don't be... Be an agreeable player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** You have not exceeded, right?

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Clearly.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:45]** her ksc plus eight she's stacked but so she's like 28 27 but like uh he grumpus grumpus said it's an attack against ksc plus eight and a nat 20 auto hit on attacks or whatever right right and that's the thing it's the fact that the combat maneuver says you make a melee attack roll that's the part that's convincing me otherwise i mean i think three of the rules are

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:47]** I think that you trip her.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** I'm going to roll that back.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** We'll cut a little bit of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** She's just like down on her knees there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:57]** Yeah, I think she absolutely goes prone.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** I think it makes total sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:03]** The image of Leora Huxley, even with her glorious hair, has not completely changed.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** Brought down by the one person.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:05]** Cara.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** It's a crack of the whip.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** She is proud.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** I told you.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** I told you you were a domino.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** I said it.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** Like, it's a thing.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** As much as you want it, Kelly.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:15]** She is proud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** That's the thing that Domino would say.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:22]** So, Migo, does that change anything that you would do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** It changes it mechanically, but not practically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** Okay, because?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:30]** Because Migo is going to step up and swing for the fences.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:37]** At this point, he's going to turn to Kara and Kara, excuse me, wink at her and say, thanks, Dummy Mommy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** Ah, Daniel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:47]** He rolled a 15 plus 7 to hit, which is a 22.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:52]** If my alcohol basic math is correct.

**[01:06:53 - 01:07:00]** That's a melee attack against Leora Huxley targeting her EAC because this does electric damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Against her EAC?

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Correct.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** Okay.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:10]** That hits Leora Huxley as she is on the ground and you step up and swing and hit her.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** That's a five on the D6.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:19]** Four, five plus seven is 12 electric damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** 12 electric damage.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Okay.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:23]** Okay.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Arcs through her armor.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** Rolling some awesome, awesome hits here.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Amazing.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Amazing.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Good, good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:36]** The one-two punch of Kara and Migosem.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** Love it.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Love it.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** I'm waiting for Boom to throw a grenade over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** Just to toss one over.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** It's time for Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** You might get your wish, you know.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** You might get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** Amazing.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:51]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** I've moved.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:52]** I've attacked.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** That is all of my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** That is all of your turn.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** Okay.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** Let's keep going.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** Ooh, ooh.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:09]** The Vesk that's standing in front of the stairs, right next to the stairs, walks over to you, Migo.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:18]** And as they're walking, they pull out this polearm and just take it with their hand and just chuck it out.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:22]** And these prongs come out with these pincers.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:26]** as if to capture you and put it around your neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** You see a glint of jealousy, like, oh, I want one of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Right as it closes around your neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** You're like, wow, cool.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** Can't wait to confiscate that goodie.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** Why doesn't S.T.A.R.S.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** team have these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:44]** It is kind of like a dark trooper weapon.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** It's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:47]** It's a bit of a dark trooper weapon for sure.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** For sure.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** Okay.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:55]** Walks over and as they come up to swing at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Come at me, buddy.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** You better come correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** That is our game.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:58]** Oh!
