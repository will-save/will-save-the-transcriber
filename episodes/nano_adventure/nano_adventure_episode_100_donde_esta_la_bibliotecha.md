**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** We never really talked about our real 100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Get off.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** 69.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** You have to look at the timing.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** It was Unknown Treasures episode 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** What happened in Unknown Treasures episode 31?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** And did we celebrate it?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** Did we record that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Then it's like 130.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** This is 100 of Jon jamming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** It's 100.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Wow.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** 200 Unknown Treasures episodes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** Yeah.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** No, no, no.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** I think you're a little low.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** There's like 400 of Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:14]** So you've done 153 eps, and then we've also done interview episodes and stuff like that.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** And then we did Plot Armors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** But of Game Time...

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** This is... This is 100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:28]** Google Sheets is freezing on me because my computer sucks, so I'm not going to... Let's not get into tech issues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** The persistent ghost in the shell that we've seen this whole time.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** The ghost in the machine.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** Anyway...

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Congratulations to you all.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** You all are a fantastic group to play with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** And then cheers to your GMing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** Thank you.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Cheers to John's GMing.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** That's a good one.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** I think I've only GMed... How many times do we play D&D?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** We've played for a while.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** But this is the longest game that I've ever GMed.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** So, it's good.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:55 - 00:03:01]** I actually want to pick your brain at some point about how to breathe life into pre-made adventures.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Sure.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** Because I feel like that's something that I'm not...

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:11]** I'll read the adventure, and I can get a grasp for the NPCs, but how do you make them feel alive?

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** I don't know.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:20]** I feel like you just... And then it feels lifted, and there's other cargo bays, and there's people that...

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Fuck around with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** You had to do that.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Thanks, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** I appreciate it.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** Leave some things out, put some things in.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Yeah.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** With the cargo base and such.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** But the characters are, like, amazing.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** So, yeah, they're really good.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** I'm going to have to ask you, because I know that I'm going to be doing it soon enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** You will be doing it.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Will's going to be doing it here soon.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Benny might be doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** Kev's already done it, so that's why he's... I mean, all the cool kids are doing it.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** Why not?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Let's fucking do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:50]** Before we thank our fantastic audience, I just want to turn to you for a sec.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** What, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Way to go back.

**[00:03:52 - 00:04:02]** Episode 31 of Drunkard's Delight, I finally got to load, was the Battle of Midzone when you had the big match with the goblins on one side and the Kestis on the other.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** Yeah.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** That was our big, that was our actual episode 100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** That was the technical 100.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Cool.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** That was a big momentous episode.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** That was.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** That was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** That was an episode befitting the occasion, for sure.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** It was.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** We just didn't know at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Our largest battle.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:27]** So, along those lines, what's been a favorite moment for you across the past...

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:32]** 100 slash 152 episodes of gameplay that we've done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** I was going to say Snake Boy, but that was a different game.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** No, no, no.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** We could do that too.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** I've got to choose a 3FC thing.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** In my own brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Also, just want to shout out Benny.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** I'm drinking this excellent scotch that you gave for the wedding.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:55]** Glenlivet, 13 year, but you can only get it at the distillery in Scotland.

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:02]** And it's with first fill European cherry casks and American bourbon casks.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** I mean, it's tasty.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** There's just no two ways about that.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** I spent entirely too much money on scotch when I was there.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** Thank you, American Express, for facilitating my habit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Fun fact, it's not called scotch.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** It's just called whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** Yeah.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:25]** Sorry, I don't want to step on Kelly's moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:25]** Kelly, please.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:30]** I was so captivated by the whiskey, because I also like Glen Levitt very much, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** It's like a nice amber.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** It's good, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** So I didn't even think about three-fold for a second there.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** But yeah, that is beautiful.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** What sort of barrels are they aged in, young Vinny?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** What about your favorite episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** I could talk entirely too long about this.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:58]** So I'm just going to say European oak, which has a much sweeter, more mellow flavor, and American white oak, which is...

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:08]** Those sharper tannin flavors that you get in more bourbons, those are the two oaks that this scotch sage can have.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:15]** I could talk a long time about why you use each one and how long you spend in each barrel and the different sizes of barrels and the economy they're in, but...

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** We're here to talk about us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:22]** Well, you know, it wouldn't be a well-saved episode if it didn't banter about some other topic that was not intended.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** Completely good.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Entirely too long.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** You know, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Yeah, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** On this 10-hour-long episode.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** I guess I liked... I guess I liked Frog.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** I miss Frog.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** And I really... Yeah, he was okay.

**[00:06:42 - 00:07:08]** did want i i wanted him to stay alive uh you know forever i sort of feel like i i john i i still wonder if like you if he was stronger if he had more health than then he seemed to have had and john just like killed him off so that you didn't have to play yeah that's what i are you sure you didn't do that i definitely didn't do it i definitely didn't do it i would have been fine to play wrong

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:35]** yeah no no he actually ran i mean he lasted for like four or five rounds that was a it was a long time against uh you know boss bbg there who yeah not to keep stealing with the frog thing but like then then i would ask kevin like kevin if we really really wanted frog to like hang out with us in unknown treasures would would that have been would you have let it happen if we were like really pushing it i i i don't honestly i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:41]** you guys would have had to like deliberately say you wanted to go to the fight.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** And then it would have been like a celebrity thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:50]** I don't know if, I don't know if he would have been able to like fit us into his busy schedule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Right.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** You know, 53 episodes.

**[00:07:52 - 00:08:15]** um so my favorite times uh i wouldn't i don't know if it's a favorite but like it's a memorable one besides like the ending of book one which everybody we talked to all our listeners especially jeremy and adam are like the end of book one that really struck me like playing this game is a

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:36]** hit so hard of like what is happening here um but another like really memorable moment for for me as rick was the belita dying because i was like the first time in book two that we we found somebody who wasn't a part of the conspiracy

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:40]** and, and Rick tried to save them and failed.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** And I think that really hurt.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Um, but I'm having a lot of fun playing Cecil.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** So that's sick.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Totally agree.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** Yeah.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** Um, I would, I would say I'm going to have two.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** One is off camera.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** One is on camera.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:20]** um my favorite moment off camera was like a few days after we did our play test um when because like john and i had talked briefly about hey i really want to like i really like what you guys are doing i would like to get involved and so but i've also never played starfinder before so i guess i'll learn a new game and we'll all play and have a good time and after that you guys were like yeah

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** that was a good time.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** We think you're a good fit.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** So let's, let's do the damn thing.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:33]** Um, and then I got like unofficial, we'll save the production company letterhead invitation to come join the cast.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:37]** That was, that was a really special moment for me personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** Yeah, we were going to, behind the scenes, we were going to send you through a couple episodes.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** We were like, hey, we want to test them multiple times.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** But then we ended up liking you so much that we were like, eh, just do it.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** That's how much we liked you.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** It's a real story.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** We were going to.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** I remember that conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:58]** I expected more layers to that process.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** And then it was just like, oh, yeah, we played half of one shot.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** And we're like, yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:10]** But, like, our structure was more, our structure was we need to have at least two tests per person.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** And we need to try out, test out.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** But, like, you just fit so well.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** And, you know, a little bit of nepotism in there because you're, you know, good friends with John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** I knew the guy.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Yeah.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Yeah.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** I mean, we definitely trade you the same after that, but that's how you got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Oh, sure.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:30]** On camera, I would say it was the end of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:39]** Like, that really poignant, tender, dramatic moment between Thaddeus and Jack.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:46]** You know, through the entire adventure, we'd both lean kind of on that sort of

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** On Thaddeus' side, the more grumpy old man, get off my lawn.

**[00:10:50 - 00:11:00]** And on Jack, where he leaned really far into the humor, where they both reached deep down and found the drama and the tenderness and had a heartfelt moment together.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** As the sun was setting.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** As the sun was setting.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:07]** It was just a masterpiece of a moment.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** It's probably the most emotional I've been on this show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:40]** it's actually probably the most emotional I've been to really weird like how emotional I was but it was good and then the anger at Rolu but it was mostly that moment with you yeah sure so yeah that's it was a good moment yeah I agree well you want to go or I can go I'd say my well I have a good yeah John you should go I have because I I want to do my segue oh dude love it yeah love it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** I don't know what segue this is, but yes, please.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** I will set you up as much as I can.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** I have two as well.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:49]** One is definitely the entirety of the last episode of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** It was just great.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** That was just such a masterpiece.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:56]** Everybody coming together and just truly role-playing at every moment.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:06]** And I have to say, it's the moment when we're walking back from the ship, back into town, and then Goldhorn calls...

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:12]** Because it's at that moment that anything we've talked about, anything could have happened.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:16]** But as soon as that happens, you have to face up and make a decision.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** And Chark, Chark didn't answer.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** Right, right.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** But then he called, but then he called Thaddeus, right?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Right?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** He called Thaddeus, right?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:32]** I was like, as a GM for that, I was like, what the f***, dude?

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Did he call Tremé?

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** I think he called Tremé right after, yeah.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, okay, thank you, yeah.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:50]** He called Tremé and Will played it beautifully of, like, playing Tremé and also playing Goldhorn and picking up and then, like, putting, like, the f***ing feet to the fire there.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** Like, I'm just like, so what's going on?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Like what happened?

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** How's it going?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** And like, we all had to be like, we have to make a decision.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** Like what, what are we going to say?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** It was great.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:08]** That to me was like the inflection point when like all the creativeness started to like propel into this direction.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** That was great.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:15]** And then also, threefold, I would say episode one, because I just love hearing your backstories.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** I come back to it a lot.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** I come back to what you all wrote.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I think about what you wrote.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** I try and include it.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** There's so much going on there.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:31]** And then by extension, Benny, the episode that you came in, when you came in, I was like, I know exactly how he's coming in.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** And then later I was like...

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:59]** how do i explain this and then i was like wait a minute i when i when i came up with the idea for how to explain it i literally like got out of my seat i was like wait for like how vinny this is it i mean i was like how colin just like got abducted just just yeah just just the whole thing i was like yes this is it so guy just does vinny doesn't know right so like that's still a secret only john knows so will what is your moment

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:04]** Well, I mean, you guys covered so many good ones.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** This is a tough one to go last on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** But he's got a Segway.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** But he's got a Segway.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** You're right.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:19]** For those on audio only, Will is actually on a two-wheeled scooter.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Just rolling around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** And he has a green screen behind him.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** I'm always riding on two wheels, whether it's motorcycles, Segways.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** My desk chair has two wheels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:41]** Core strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Core strength.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:47]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:54]** No, recently I really liked Starship Combat because I liked piloting, and we finally did it.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** We finally got through it.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** We weren't terrible.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** You were great.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:05]** There was a bit of a breaking in period, obviously, but I feel like it was really fun.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** We got to work together as a team.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** But my all-time favorite will always be...

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** The next episode of We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** There it is.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** There it is.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** That was strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Gonna clap for that.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** That was good.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** That was good.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Finger heart.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:33]** I can't say that I didn't expect you to say Starship, but for you to like Starship Combat.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Did anyone else like it?

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** I love it.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** I love it a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Me too.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** I actually want to dig more into the...

**[00:15:43 - 00:16:10]** the starship uh manual like the book that they put in i mean we'll see what happens with 2e but like they put in so many great rules about just different scenarios being like an inner atmosphere having squadrons having like starships i want to board a ship yeah yeah that would be really really rating as a pirating party come on i'm going to my what i really wanted to try and uh

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Yes.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:16]** I am going to my global prep notes, and I'm just putting in board a ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:22]** Just like a full-on pirate adventure of just plundering and pirating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** I'm going to be breach a ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** Just breach a f***ing ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** As a part of a squadron.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** Well, we've talked about the Expanse before.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Yeah.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** John, that'd be great.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Maybe we could...

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:45]** I wonder if we could tie that into the thing that you and I are talking about, but I don't know.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Shoot me a DM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Because that could be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Maybe you could find out next time.

**[00:16:53 - 00:17:05]** And if you didn't know, you could continue to ensure that episodes will be next by supporting us on Ko-fi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:21]** that is a great way to do that absolutely go to coffee.willsaythepodcast.com and you can spell coffee almost any way you can imagine because we certain ways are yeah but and if it doesn't work tell us we can add that too because who knows yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:27]** But I do want to say thank you to everybody who's listening now, in the future, whenever, everyone across the world.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:31]** There are many ways that you can spend your time and your money.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** And we thank you.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:39]** We thank you for spending it with us for these 100, false 100, true 152 episodes.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** You all are what make it.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** You're what make it happen.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** So cheers to you.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Cheers to our listeners.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Cheers to our listeners.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Cheers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** Oh, and our viewers, because we have screens, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:58]** I felt like listener was kind of inclusive of, like, viewer, supporter, listener, audience member, you know, when they come in, so...

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** With that, let's play.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Let's get back into this nano adventure.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Just squeeze all the nano that we can out of it.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** You know what I mean?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Just get it all nanoed out.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:09]** Nano, nano.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:13]** Let's get this nano all over you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Dude, it might nano.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Nano, nano.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Nano.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Nano.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I like it.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** I like it.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** You all turned investigative last time.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:31]** put on your investigator cap which by the way Commander Bolt was like hey if you see anything that might be a little like

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:38]** You know, this general behavior fits a pattern.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** It always does.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** It fits a pattern.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:46]** And so why don't you take some time, look around, collect some clues, right?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:56]** So you all break into the highly forbidden residential area of this space, as Kev has told us many times.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** It's not allowed to have a residential home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:06]** I mean, if we don't have a residential area, after we collect the clues, where do we sit in our thinking chair and think, think, think at?

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** The lobby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** The lobby.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** The lobby usually has a couple of chairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** It's not good for opening up your here's the mail kind of thing, though.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** Like in the middle of a lobby where everyone can see.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Kevin just doesn't like that.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** With that, let's keep going.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** So you all put on your investigator caps.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** What, Jeff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:39]** Yeah, speaking of investigator caps, I've been racking my brain for a whole week now about how I think Leora is in on it.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:52]** The whole precog thing with the mirror and the room, the book full of precog stuff, or a bookshelf full of precog books, the fact that there's only walking to that area, like everything in that one room

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** was so evidential.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** I don't know the word for it.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Is that the right word?

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** I don't even know if that's the right word.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:08]** Anyways, it points to people being familiar and the fact that the traps were all not triggered.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:15]** The traps were set for us, but they weren't triggered by any of the invaders.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** You would have seen.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** You would have said, hey, the trapdoor was triggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** Yeah, that's a really good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** And those traps weren't put in by the intruders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:30]** I mean, there was a Yosuke agent in there.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** Remember, they opened the door on Rigo.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** They were in there.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** Maybe they set traps because they knew you were coming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** It was integrated into the system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** It was like a part of the building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** Maybe they broke in and set the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:50]** If you think about the timescale that these people are working on, they've seen this vision of the future.

**[00:20:50 - 00:21:02]** They would have infiltrated the building committee for this building in order to install whatever they needed to and then sent the agents in to just enable the things that were in the building plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** And Bolt did say, I can't get a hold of the architects and the engineers and the contractors.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** I can't get a hold of them.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Yeah, they're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:15]** And the last thing with Leora is this is her building.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** This is her office, her home.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** But the precog thing, like you're saying, you're making it sound like the IFFs are the precogs.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** I'm saying Leora is the precog of the IFF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** Also, keep in mind that the IFF is not – you don't have to be a precog to get in.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:36]** It might be part of like just what happens that you are and you're interested.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** You could be almost anything.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:57]** The integrated future front, which, again, basically what happened was the founders were doing some sort of, you know, like a ritual and that that got there was some mishap and they got a vision of this utopian future free of war and disease and everything else.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** And then they wrote down everything that it looked like.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:08]** And so when that happens, keep in mind that there's a certain level of granularity that is not achieved.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:14]** It's not like the book says that at like 3.30 at this time, so-and-so is going to like, you know, go to the bathroom.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** It's like there's kind of a broader brush sometimes.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Sometimes it's very specific.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:24]** Sometimes it's a broader brush about what might need to happen in order to get there.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** It's the results.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:49]** i sort of agree that with kevin that i think there's a possibility she's involved and it would make a very good twist for sure well this is just my my three full conspiracy hat yeah she has a lot of tinfoil she has a lot of interest in association with them because of that university that we found out about that she's a singularity conservatory so it's like you know because they do precog stuff so it's like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** I feel like I can see it.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Yeah.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** You can see it.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** Well, let's kick off the centennial episode.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:13]** Ken, you guys did all this investigation, discovered some things on our computer about talking with the stewards, talking with the Singularity Conservatory, discover that there is a painting that shows you 20 seconds into the future, roughly with this impressionist style that also, uh,

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:30]** shows one of the pieces of metal in the sculpture floating, and you deduced that you need to put this piece of metal under the same solar impulse as what was hitting the solar detector on the metal itself.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** And you could see that happening before it happened.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** And then also Kara saying, you know what, there's something going on here.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** I'm going to use this Seeker Slime.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** And then right as that Seeker Slime lights up, it opens.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:54]** You walk down a staircase just step after step for several hundred feet and you get to a...

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:04]** open door at the bottom and you do some sweet checks, which I have to say, awesome props to you all for using your equipment and your nano skills at every door.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** You've done some sort of like look into what could be in the room, trying to glean as much information.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** It's paid off.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** It's great.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** You do that here.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Can't tell too much.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:18]** It seems like there's something missing from your location.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** There's a dark spot in the radar.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Not sure what that is.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:39]** warm air smell of books and you all go in and i believe you were going in in the order of cecil cara boom amigo archie right you walk in we send an archie first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** Do you send it to Archie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** No, I mean, I don't see why not.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Like, Archie would be a great scout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** What's Archie's stealth?

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Archie's stealth?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** No, that's a good question.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Archie's stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** It's a small floating object.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** It could be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** Maybe.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** It's under the new office tab.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Archie's stealth is plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** Not what I meant to have happen at all.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** There's something going on with Foundry.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** I don't know what's going on with Foundry.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** Looks good on my end.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** Yeah, it's not good on my end.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** One second.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** I don't know what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:25]** The map that I want to take you to is having... Yeah, we get to use the Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** technical issues slate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Yeah.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** It's not Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** O.K., by the way.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** It's not?

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** No.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Is that Dr.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** O.K.?

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** What's his name?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Bukakis?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Bukakis?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** It's not Bukakis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** It's not Dr. Bukakis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** It's not Bukakis.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** Contrary to what you may think, I don't think that's what Will was intending.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:59]** It's just a bunch of slices of pizza surrounding it.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:05]** Dust floats serenely amongst the double-height books.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** and the stacks of bookshelves along the walls.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:18]** And there are rows of tall bookshelves revealing a richly appointed, warm, friendly warehouse.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Except it's quiet.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:33]** The setting sunlight drips through high windows on the east while a set of stairs appears in the back to lead to a small platform.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** And below that is a heavy bunker door.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Let me bring you in to this map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Oh, wow.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** It looks really nice.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** This is totally different vibe.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Like yellow glowing bookshelves and stuff.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** That's kind of nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:56]** Yeah, there's a lot of care in the preservation of these books.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** Wow.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** There's a statue in the center.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:04]** Some pieces of furniture have drapes over them, not used.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** Are there, like, data servers and stuff in here or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:11]** Yeah, and there are data servers immediately as you walk up.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** Remember that you walked into a little landing and then backed up a few steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:24]** The bookshelves in here obscure any possible things that might be hiding behind them, but it's a very, very nice atmosphere.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Let's clear the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:32]** Cecil's going to move forward and swing around each of the bookcases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** I'm taking left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Clear.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Migo goes with boom.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Clear.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** There is something in the middle.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** It looks kind of creepy.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** It's like an amorphous statue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** It looks like a web thing.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** There is a statue in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** It looks like a Greek sort of marble statue.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** Like a person.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** A human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** I did.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** I did.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** Give me a perception check, everybody.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:21]** those traps oh my god yeah here we're 24 24 9 17 17 from boom and what was it Cecil 20 20 yeah 20 okay ready

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Cecil starts to move up the center.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** There are two rows of bookshelves.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Kara starting, I think, to swing over to the right.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Yeah?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** You were walking by the back bookshelf.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** And boom, Amigo starts walking up the left bookshelf.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Boom.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** You're looking ahead.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** And you look off to your right and see this statue in the center of the room.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:50]** And there's something that catches your eye in your peripheral.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** You look up.

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:05]** And at the top of this platform, mixed in with the shadows, you make out the barrel of a rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** And you need to roll for initiative.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Oh, my God.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** It's that platform up in the north.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Top left corner of the room.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** Top left corner of the room.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:26]** Let me add you guys to the carousel here, and then we'll go around and get the initiatives.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Add you guys all in.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** What did everybody get?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** Cara got a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Love it.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Cecil, you put yours in?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** 13.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** What did Boom get?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** 8.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** What about Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Migo got an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** Migo got an 11.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Alrighty.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** So far,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Mine's still paused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** I can't... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** It's still paused.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Yeah.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** So, boom.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** You noticed this.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** You should be able to see the carousel in the top left corner.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Top of round one.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** Boom, you noticed this.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** There's no surprise rounds.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** We're just going to move right in because you did notice this.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** Kara, it's your turn first.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** You're in the back of the room.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** I don't know if you can see maybe what's going on here.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** So I'm not sure what input you would have gotten.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** I don't think Boom might have said anything yet.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:43]** There is Bogey with a rifle right up there on top platform.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Look out.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** So I can't see the area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:55]** From what I can see, you can maybe make it out, but it's in between the windows of the bookshelves, right?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** So like here?

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** Yeah, like there's a platform up in this general area.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** I'm pinging on my map here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** So what are the lighting conditions down here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** They're normal light.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** Because of the bookshelves and the windows, then it's normal light.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:19]** So she's going to try and move to orient.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** I moved one extra than I would have probably.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Okay.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** I think probably sneak up to this spot here.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Are you like running up low?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** Like I'm totally ready to power.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Are you moving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** Otherwise, is there like, can I see her?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** Can I see around this corner without having to go that far?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:48]** you just moved into the center more in front of Cecil.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** You might be able to see something there.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** You could give me a perception check.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:56]** You could probably see better if you were where you were further up to the right.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** Yeah, I think she would have gone probably straight up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Okay, all right, cool.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Yeah.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:16]** Give me... Your perception check would have seen it, so I actually think... Sorry, let me... Like, your previous perception check, you would have been able to see it, because I'm going to roll that over into this first round, because everything happens so...

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** Quickly.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:32]** So you're able to run up, step off to the side, and you can see the shape of like a light purple skin that highlights kind of a fierce red armor of a shoulder that appears both kind of archaic and new a little bit.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:36]** There are like leather sashes and clips holding it together.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** Modern metal to balance this protection and flexibility.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** And you're looking and you're like...

**[00:32:43 - 00:33:07]** this is a huge creature like not like it's technically a large creature but it's big and you recognize these these tusks these angry tusks and there's an eye that looks at you and it's yellow and you're like this is a Shabbat like there's like a muscular shoulder holding the rifle steady do I see it on the map

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Let me reveal it on the map.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** Crouching, sitting at the apex of this desk up here.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:20]** There is a concealment as there's like a low three-foot wall that it's using to lean the sniper rifle on.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:28]** Yeah, I think she's going to take aim with her.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** She had equipped her...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:55]** philosopher's sting two-handed sniper weapon oh nice sniper v sniper you will have a 20% mischance just given the concealment because of the angle that you're at they're a story above you you know they're probably like eight feet up and it's just the top half of their body so there's going to be a 20% concealment given the fact that they're crouching

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** So you roll to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** You know what?

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** I'm not going to fire yet.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** I'm going to take aim as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Okay, what does that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:14]** If you aim the weapon as a move action... Oh, I have to fire it the same turn.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:14]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** I was going to say, did you already use your move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** Yeah, to move into place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** You can still fire if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Yeah, I'll just fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Okay.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:47]** okay just firing give me that fire and then give me a d100 roll let me know what you get moving up the side quickly gun ready uh 16 on the die for 21 for a 21 against casey yes yeah and would i roll for a mischance

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** You roll a d100.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Don't get a 20 or below.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** A 40.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** You're good.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** It fires, hitting them in the shoulder.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Nicely done.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** What's your damage there with your sweet weapon?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** I can hear that die rolling.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** Seven.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Okay.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Amazing.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** You run up, crouch down, aim, take a shot, hit in the shoulder.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Love it.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Love it.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** You're, I feel like you're very used to this.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** You're like, there's a threat.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** There's a sniper.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** I know what to do.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** I know how to move the dice.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Tell the story.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:26]** Classic work of God.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** Always proficient.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Efficient.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Love it.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:35]** It is this Shabbat sniper's turn.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** They had their eye on you, Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** And you know what they're going to do?

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** They're going to shoot at Kara because Kara's shy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:47]** They're going to shoot at... I actually think... Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:53]** I'm going to let the dice decide on... Most likely we'll shoot at Kara based on experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:59]** Literally, I think that they are going to turn and shoot at Kara as soon as they are hit.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:04]** Kara, that is going to be... That's a 31 against EAC.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Yeah.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** That hits.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Is that a crit?

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** It's not a crit.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** 31.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Against EAC.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Yeah.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Okay.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:24]** You take 14 points of fire damage as this incredible precise shot hits you in the same spot that you shot at them.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** It took how much?

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** 14 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Okay.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:32]** Well, I'm going to use my defensive dispersal.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:36]** To heal it up?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Yeah.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** So you see this sort of like...

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** reaction within Kara's body.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** And what happens?

**[00:36:48 - 00:37:04]** You just see this burning of nanosite energy as a surge of energy sort of reconstructs this fire that was burned, I guess, on her body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Yeah.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** It's a painful wound.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yeah.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** It's a painful wound.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Hell yeah.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Love it.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** And then you're looking, Kara, and you're tracking them.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** And then as soon as they fire...

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Your eyes close, wince in pain.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** You look back.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Feels like it's tough to see them.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** You're like, I think it's kind of like blurry.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Double fire?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** What?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** You got hit once.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:34]** You open your eyes and look back at their location.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** It's hard to tell where they were.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:41]** And you're like, I know they're right there, but I can't quite make them out.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:58]** cecil what are you doing you are direct almost direct center of the room and hear this shot and car get hit uh so the others have already called out where this guy's located so cecil's gonna run up where to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I'm seeing how far I can run.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Okay.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:09]** He's going to run up past the statue and along, it looks like there's a bookshelf that's in the middle.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:24]** So he's going to run up to the edge of that, kind of take a little bit of cover from that, but he's going to, on his way up there, pull a grenade from his belt and pull the pin and when he gets to the top, fling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** So that is going to be... Tell me the corner that you're targeting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** So it's, what, a 35-foot throw.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** Then add whatever's up.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** I'm going to throw.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** You're how far away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Between the two?

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, you're like 30.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Okay, so that corner is like 35 feet away.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Let's say it's eight feet up.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Let's call it 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** Finally, the Pythagorean theorem comes in handy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** It's here.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** I'll do it, but I think it's roughly like 40, 45 feet.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:03]** You're pretty much at your one range increment beyond, because it's a 20-foot range increment for your grenade, right?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** 20-foot range.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Right?

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** To alley-oop the grenade.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:23]** I'm actually listening to SCF right now, and I'm in the middle of book two, and they use alley-oop incorrectly, and then they use it correctly, and it's a very fun time.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Anyway, yeah.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Good times.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Alright, so you alley-oop it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** I think this is the right term for it.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** No, an alley-oop is when you recover it from someone else, and then shoot it back.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Before you touch the ground.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** So you're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:48]** If Cecil was throwing it up and then Kara was hitting it into the bogey, that would be appropriate use of alley-ooping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** That just feels like a set spike from volleyball.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** It's very similar to a set spike.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:56]** Could you not just be alley-ooping this to the ground?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** No, it's lobbing.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Lobbing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Okay.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Benny just... No.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** All right, so you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** What did you roll?

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** Tell me.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** I rolled an 18 on a die.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** I'm trying to look at my... That's fine.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** ...throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** AC7, right?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Sure.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** With the branch equipment?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Yeah.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Yeah, you hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Okay, so this one on Hero Lab, it has a DC.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I don't think there actually is a DC for it.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** It is a sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** So it's got a 10-foot radius.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Yep.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:31]** And it's 2d4 rounds of entanglement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Okay.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** So I don't think there's a save for that.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:40]** Yeah, I think the DC is to save from being entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** Ah.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** But it doesn't say that in the book.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** There's no DCs for the grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:51]** Well, but it's also like you are entangled, but the DC is for you to break out of the entanglement on your turn.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Right, right.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:57]** Because if you're entangled, you can still take a move action to get yourself out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:03]** Yeah, I mean, they're in the area in which the bomb goes off, so I'm assuming that they become entangled pretty quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** I just don't know grenades well enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:10]** To your point, you throw the grenade, when the grenade goes off, they are entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** The DC is for me to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:20]** Even like a regular explosive grenade, what's the reflex save?

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Isn't there a DC for reflex save?

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Where does it say that?

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Probably, yeah.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** I don't see where they sit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** I think it depends on the level of the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Yeah, the mark one, two, or three.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** You take a look and let me know.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** I don't want to look this up, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** This is the most complicated part of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Well, question.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Like say alley-oop?

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Or lob?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Kobe.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** He's going to say grenade.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** You missed the opportunity to say boom.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** He's going to actually, as soon as he throws it, he's like, I learned that from Boom.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** He says that to Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Okay.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Love it.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Boom gives you a good wink.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Migo, it's your turn.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You are behind Boom.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** Wait, do I roll the 2d4?

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** Roll your 2d4.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** Yes.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** I'll roll 1d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** Tell me what your damage is now.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:20]** That one is a 2d4.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** I'm doing this with my book by my hand.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** And a three for a total of five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Five damage.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Yeah.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** As you hear this.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** As they are now entangled.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Love it.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Sweet.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Amazing.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Smart thinking.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Trying to trap them down.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Move up.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Move in.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Quickly.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Quietly.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Miko.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** Well, not quietly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Smat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Smat.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** So Migo is going to shuffle past.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** He is a bit of a like... Oh, sorry.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** I have my ruler set up, not my actual character thing.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:04]** He's going to move up along this bookcase here and take his shot at the newly entangled bogey dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Okay.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Question.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** I think you... Let me look at the entangled condition.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** They get a minus two to ace it.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Okay, so they are entangled.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:22]** You need to roll, if you want, a perception check, because it's tough to see them, especially as you're walking up, you're at an angle.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** But also, when you try and look up there, it's hard for your eyes to focus on what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** You want perception?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Yeah, perception check.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** That is a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:55]** okay uh yeah you land you're like it's cool i'll just stop and take a look you can't quite tell where they are it's it's frustrating so you're gonna have you're gonna have a 50 percent mischance because they technically have total concealment and you're firing into a square where you pretty much know that you are are they in a defilade

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** I don't know.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** I don't know what you're saying.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** Not sure what that is.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** But no.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Good question, though.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** Migo, what's your shot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:09]** So let's roll to attack first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Okay.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** See if you even get in the area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:17]** That is 10 on the die plus 515 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Against EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** That's a hit.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** Nice.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** You actually hit him.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Give me your D100.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** my tiny metal dice, because they feel nice in my hands.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yeah, they do.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** 93.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** 93.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** You needed above a 50 in order to hit, so you hit.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Crushed it.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Crushed it.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Crushed it.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** What's your damage on that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** Damage.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:45]** 1d10 sound damage?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Sonic?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Sonic?

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Sonic?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Sonic?

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** The damage?

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** 1d10 Sonic for

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Seven sonic damage.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Seven sonic damage.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** With the Pulse Staccato Rifle.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:16]** I feel like he just does a forward roll and is crouched a little bit, leaned against the bookcase, and just like... It just hit him center of mass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Yeah.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** That's amazing.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** I think I got him.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Very good.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Okay.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Good turn.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Good turn, all of you.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** These are boom, boom, boom.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** One by one, making good turns.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Boom.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** You going to continue this trend?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Good turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:36]** Yeah, Boom is going to do something, and Kelly's not aware.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** I'm pretty sure he could do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** What does that mean?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** We'll just take it step by step.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:51]** So basically, Boom has his bandolier, and he pulls out another grenade, and he's like, hmm...

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:56]** And then he does an alley-oop himself up to that platform.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** An alley-oop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** Okay, so you alley-oop up to which corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:06]** He wants to throw the grenade up to, yeah, like, I don't know.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:10]** I guess, like, the corner, like, yeah, exactly where you're pointing right now.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** So that's three range increments beyond.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** So it's going to be an AC9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** So he's going to move, I guess, right?

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** Okay, okay, yeah.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:22]** So he can move and then do it, yeah.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:28]** So to make it a little bit better, I guess he'll be like right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** He'll run up next to Miko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Watch this.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** And he like tosses it up.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:40]** And then like as he does this, like the ball just starts to roll with this electrical energy.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:46]** And then it explodes open and a lightning elemental comes out.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** Because this is a summoning grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** This is a summoning grenade.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Yeah.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Alright.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** And if you can, you would like to.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:03]** Now, these summon creatures treat them like I'm their god, basically, so I can tell them what to

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:28]** do that you'd be like give him big strike and then like uh the uh i don't know if i could do this in the same term so i'm looking this up right now but a lightning elemental they can they can act in the same turn yeah all right fantastic there's still so many mechanic sweet so that will determine a lightning strike

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:57]** lightning elemental slam so he'll slam his own sort of lightning boom and it will deal half electricity damage and half bludgeoning damage you gotta give me one second real quick I'm looking it up right now yeah sounds good okay so you throw this and summon I am looking for that's what I was looking for right there

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Oh, wait, no, wait.

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** Let's see.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** Yeah.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** Lightning strikes.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** For some reason, I can't find that attack.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** But even though it's listed, so.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Okay.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** Lightning strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Is it a level one?

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Lightning?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** What level?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** I can do up to level three, I believe.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** So I did level three in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** That's pretty rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Really?

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Level three?

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** Yeah, well, I think so.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** Because of the level I'm at, I can get up to level three, I thought, was wait for the summoning grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** I think you need a... Let's see.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:46]** As if you had cast a summon creature spell of a spell level and cast a level according to the grenade's type.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** So do you have a Mark 3, a Mark 1, or a Mark 2?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Or a Mark 4, or 5, or 6?

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Holy s***.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Mark 3.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Mark 3, yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** So, yeah.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:54]** Okay, yep.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** That's usually what it is.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** So I gave you ownership of that lightning elemental that's up there.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:04]** So you are able to move it and do what you need to do on it.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** So it's going to attack.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** You throw this sweet summoning grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:16]** I would love to attack it, except, like, every time I look up, like, lightning, it just says a slam deals half electricity damage and half bludgeoning damage.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Is that enough to go off?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** I mean, do you have a roll to hit and damage?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** It's a melee attack, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Yeah, slam is a melee attack.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** I didn't know if there was anything else cool that I could do.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** All right, cool.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** So he's going to do that.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** He's like, give him.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Good crash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:39]** And then, like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:39 - 00:50:03]** yeah so uh so it's it's it's like a nine to hit though um kind of kind of unsteady just slams forward right next to it totally misses it uh but good try good try good try there is now a a lightning elemental next to this creature amazing you just out of the corner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** ready to go.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Yeah.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** Yeah.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** In your own nano way.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Okay, cool.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Good turn.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Good turn.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** You got another combatant on the field.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** I like it.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** I like it.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** You want to do anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Okay.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Love it.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Top round two car of Altar.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** We're back to you.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** The ever professional.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:32]** She is going to use a special ability of taking deadly aim for minus two on the attack.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Okay.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Do they still have concealment even from where I'm at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** You're going to have to roll another perception, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Roll a perception?

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Roll a perception check, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** I got a 18.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** 18.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** There's just a moment where everything syncs up and you're able to see exactly where they are.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** So it's only 20% concealment just from where you're at.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Good turn.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** You're able to focus in and find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** All right.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** I'm going to try and take deadly aim again.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Okay.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Love it.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** It's a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Yeah, that hits again.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Constant.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Doesn't miss.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** One hit car.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** Ten points of damage.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Ooh!

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Wow.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Wow.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Plus... Oh.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Sorry.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Because I took deadly aim.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Uh-huh.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** What's the...

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** It's not 10.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** It's 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** 13 points of damage.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:45]** Extra damage that hits them closer, I feel like, to the neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Actually, no.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Sorry, 12.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** 12.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** It's half my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:50 - 00:52:16]** base attack and i would round down right okay yep yep brown down okay still stand in the same spot are able to hold your breath focus in everything lines up take the shot love it clean professional you uh do anything else with your turn you just stand there i think the deadly aim is a move it's a move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:29]** oh to to put it on the shot or not oh i guess i could do a full attack if i wanted yeah okay would i roll again no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:58]** yeah you would have had a minus four to your earlier attack and then yeah and then you would have to do that and take deadly aim is not okay all right so good turn boom two shots clean efficient love it incredible you quote okay it is this shabbat's turn who you all are down below taking shots at love it love it who do they shoot at two of you are throwing grenades two of you have shot

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Yeah, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:13]** I'm still trying to follow up on whether or not you get a save against the original entanglement, but it does under the entangle section say you have to use a move action.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:23]** Creature can attempt such a check as a move action.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:31]** The check is either an acrobatics, which is going to be a DC 11, or a strength check for DC 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** To get out.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** To get unentangled.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** Okay.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Copy.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** But it is a move action.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Otherwise you stay entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** You know what they're going to do?

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** They're going to surrender.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** They're going to nest it up.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Guys, I'm done!

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** I'm so sorry that I did this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** Actually, I sent Lightning Boy up to negotiate your surrender.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** He's very, very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** What does Lightning Boy sound like?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** He's just like... I'm communicating that way.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** He's like, I don't speak your language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** I don't know what to say.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** He's very persuasive, yes.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Kara, the weapon stays trained on you.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** And there's just a voice that calls out,

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** The future for you all is grim unless you accept your fate.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** He's going to fire again at you, Kara.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Even with a minus two, that is a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** That is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** 13 points of fire damage as another shot.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** Again, rings closer.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:47]** Again, where you hit, they hit you in the same location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:53]** Alright, I'm... As a reaction... Ooh, yeah!

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:56]** Can you take two reactions, or no?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** No, you have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Okay.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** You have one reaction per round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** One per turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Per round.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Yeah, per round.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Um... What's your reaction?

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** 27 points of damage so far to you.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Yeah, she's like a tank.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Yeah, of course she is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:22]** I'm taking HP damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** You're into your HP now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:30]** What if I do react?

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** Do I take HP?

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** What are the abilities that you're choosing between?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** No.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** I can do defensive dispersal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:47 - 00:56:04]** Or I can form an extra cloud without it going against my max nanocloud array because I have the reactive spray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** And what does that do?

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** I laugh at danger.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Okay.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:26]** And if I take HP damage from a significant foe, but not down to zero HP, I grant all my allies a plus two to their AC until next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** I'm going to do that.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** And she's going to be like, let's take this guy down.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Laughing in danger.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Okay.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** So you're at HP damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** I think you can take us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:49]** I'm still following up on the screen, and I think you should have gotten a save against the additional explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Okay, well, now we know.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** It's fine.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Cool.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** Kara, badass, laughing in danger.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** I mean, like, this is a grenade-heavy crew.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:03]** You're probably going to throw grenades again, so now we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:06]** Boom does, like, a sly, light smile.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** He knows Kara, so it's good to see.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:13]** It's good to see her, like, de-gaffing coming out as he sees now and again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** The closer that she gets to death.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** What is your HP at, Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:23]** I don't want to say, but it's 23.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** It's 23?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** You could always retreat.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** You could always retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** Or use... Or tactically maneuver, but apparently no one else thinks that that's good.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** But yeah, you could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Okay, wait.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** But in this situation...

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** She's not just going to run away.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** She's going to fall back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** No one's running away.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** No one's running away.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Thaddeus is just running away.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:55]** As soon as combat starts misrepresenting... She has an auto CPR unit.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** That's true.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:56]** She does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** This isn't true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** She has an auto CPR unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Well, that was their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** You running away?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Heck no.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** Cecil is going to move up.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** I'm a little curious on the way this...

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** I don't... Well, he probably has reach anyways, but he's going to step up.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** He's going to go up the stairs.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Okay.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** He's going to go up the stairs.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:31]** Because they're upstairs as well, so I can't... I want to be 10 feet away from him, but I can't because of the way the map is set up, right?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Okay.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** I'm asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:39]** Yeah, they are taking up most of that front area, so as soon as you step up, you're within 5 feet of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:44]** And I can't be one step down in order to get 10 feet away from them.

**[00:58:44 - 00:59:10]** you could be 10 feet away i just think you would still get that concealment okay uh anyways i'll step up all to the stairs and be within the five feet and get a clear shot at him um that's gonna grant flanking to uh the electro electro yeah i was gonna say that'll be nice yeah okay well calm buddies i guess

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:18]** Yeah, so as Cecil moves up, his arm, or the gun kind of melts back into his arm, and he pulls the pike off his back.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:23]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** What?

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** It's not when I'm up here.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Where are you?

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** Hold on.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** No, that's not good.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Tim?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** There is still going to be concealment.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:37]** It's tough to see exactly where their body is.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** Is this something on a special ability?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Do you want to give me just a quick intelligence check?

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:44]** Yeah, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** I don't know if I have intelligence, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** I think I'm doing it right.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** I'm sure somebody's going to call me and be like, you're not doing it right.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** I have a zero for intelligence.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** I'm not a very smart dude.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Just give me a roll real quick.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** 14.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** 14.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:02]** That's enough to know that you recognize this as a cloaking field.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:08]** So it allows them to use stealth to hide as a move action, which they use at the end of their turn.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:14]** That you can hide even when being directly observed and no place to hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:16]** Okay.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Yeah.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Great.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:25]** I'm going to attack with my pike, even though he has... It's only a 20% concealment, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:35]** It's a 50, because I think technically when you're sitting... See, you're right in front of it, so I think it's a 20, because there's still some sense of concealment there.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** That feels more appropriate to me.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** When you guys were down there, it's probably 50.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** Ooh, that's a 19 on the die.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** That's a plus four to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** Oh, I thought you were saying it's a 19 like a D100.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Yeah, that is definitely a hit.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Give me a D100 roll.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Okay, hold on.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Roll less than 20.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Roll, roll less than 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** It's a 50.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** 50 something.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:58]** 50.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Yeah.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** You're fine.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** You're fine.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** You're fine.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Yeah.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Come up.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Stab with your pike.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** You alley-oop over the corner and stab with the pike.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Olympic style.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** I love that.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Yeah.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** That's really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** Why not?

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Don't alley-oop.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** Please stop using alley-ooping.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** I think I'm using it as it's intended.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Google alley-oop for me.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Eight on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:33]** I'm about to spam our Discord with alley-oop videos and gifs and TikToks just to drive the point home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:33]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** For sure.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:39]** Eight on the die for a total of 15 points of non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** 15 points of non-lethal damage.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Okay, love it.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Amazing.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Okay, love it.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:52]** You stab in and you see this brief sense of

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:11]** Their body like slumps over and then their body reactivates phase two of the combat as they have their Shabbat ferocity and they don't go down.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** And you know what?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** That's our game.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** Am I going to crit and Kara goes down in this next turn?

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Uh-uh.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** Nope.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Nope.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** No, you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Oh, I got plans for you.
