## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:15]** That was tight.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** That was a good one.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:20]** That was a good one because you want to know why you have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:23]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Come on in.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** Sit down on the table, you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** We'll save.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** Come get the We'll Save.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** Come save all of your work.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:41]** I am your nano GM, John Swan, and I'm joined by my nano friends, Will Garrett, Kevin Decker, Benny Rodriguez, and Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:48]** And once again, thank you, Will, for not just waving and then saying nothing like we did last time.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** That was a good time.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Thank you.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Lessons learned.

**[00:01:52 - 00:02:03]** Here is my question for you because we are just rolling this over right from the gem in the green room, which is to say, what's your favorite cereal?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:13]** Oh, well, this is... This feels like the time to just munch on some cereal in the morning, because it's that, right?

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:23]** This is like, you know, it's like that new year, end of year energy, and you're like, I don't want to do anything except hibernate, so why don't I just crunch on some cereal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** And then just sleep immediately.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:30]** I think I'm going to go out and buy myself some Captain Crunch tonight.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:34]** Captain Crunch is for sure my favorite, but it has to have the berries.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** You can never find it.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:48]** The only time that I, like, really get cereal is, like, you get, like, a continental breakfast at a hotel or something, and you look at everything out there, and it's just, like, garbage.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:55]** You're like, fine, I will do the tiny cereal box that they sell you.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** The little plastic with the... But it's never got to crunch, though.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Yeah.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:04]** And in that case, I will go in descending order.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:13]** Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and then Frosted Flakes, and then... Vinny's thumb popped.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Oh, everybody's thumbs are popping up.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** Probably, like...

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** Maybe they have Honey Bunches of Oats.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:25]** If they have that, then that goes above Frosted Flakes for sure.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Honey Bunches of Oats are tough.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** It's tough, man.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** It's a tough gig.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:36]** Getting a good cereal is at a continental breakfast, especially if you're rolling in at 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Oh, yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Right before it closes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** The waffle machine's super dirty.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** And they just close so early.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:49]** Go early, folks, and just go back up to your room and go pass out.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** Early's like Kevin time, so you have to wake up at like 6 a.m.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** You have to be there at 6 a.m.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** to get any food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:00]** Which you won't be Kevin, but you could be after Kevin before other people.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:04]** Kev actually has no idea what we're talking about because he's always the first one at the Continental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** Yeah, because it goes from 6 a.m.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** to 7 a.m.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** And that's dinner.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** He's hovering over the pancake printer for hours.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** I usually help set up.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:19]** It's just... Have you ever seen those pancake conveyors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** No.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Yeah, I have.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** I have.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** It's like an assembly line of pancakes.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** It's assembly line pancake.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** It's pretty good.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** That's cool.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** They slowly heat up as they go down like a ramp.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:37]** Google ads or sales for buying a mini pancake machine for $4,700.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Buy a waffle maker.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Don't buy a pancake machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** I know.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:47]** Or if you're going to get a pancake machine, get like Poffitures, like the little mini pancakes.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Oh, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:53]** Do you guys remember the cereal boxes?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** Yes!

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Kids these days will have no... Zoomers don't know.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** They don't know what they have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** Wait, what?

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** The games inside, the faction figures inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:09]** No, I'm talking about the individual mini cases.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** That's what I was talking about.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** They'll still exist, Kevin!

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** They used to be boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Like cardboard boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** What else are there?

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** And you'd have to cut it down the middle and fold it out like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:27]** What is this future cereal container that you're using?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Kevin does not know what a search engine is.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Oh.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** There's never the little box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** That's why they had such terrible selection at that last hotel I was at.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** It's just all cereals from 1980.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** It tasted horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** Not only came late to the clock, he came late by 25 years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:53]** That's a classic error for Will.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** He's trying to re-enter the timeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** Of all places to re-enter the timeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:03]** My favorite cereal is clearly Lucky Charms.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** Followed by Frosted Mini Wheats and Cheerios.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Frosted Mini Wheats!

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** Dude, Frosted Mini Wheats have been my jam.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** Whole life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Frosted Whole Wheats are weird.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Nobody eats those, right?

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:24]** That's when you get a single wheat the size of the travel boxes we were just talking about.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** Are you talking about one large single frosted mini wheat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:33]** That's why they're called mini wheats is because the original was just a block of wheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:39]** It's like in Ted Lasso where he just puts a single piece of cereal in the bowl and it's the whole f***ing bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** Yes.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** And then you're supposed to break it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:49]** I'm surprised and a little disappointed that no one has mentioned Oreo O's.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** I don't think Oreo O's exist.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** You've never had Oreo O's?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:02]** If I want a cereal that I enjoy but has no substance, Oreo O's.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** It is.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** It's Oreo cookie, but rounded.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:11]** And then it's got like the frosting on the outside and little morsels.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Speckles of the filling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** I've had them.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** They're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Easily my favorite cereal.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** But, like, I can't have it on deck.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** Otherwise, I'll eat it and have zero nutrition for the morning.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** Nothing else.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** So, like, that is my favorite.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:35]** Obviously, frosted mini wheats live in my pantry right next to cinnamon life.

**[00:07:35 - 00:08:00]** cinnamon oh yeah the battle with cinnamon life is similar to captain crunch in that you want to eat it right on the ragged edge of like properly milked and mush yeah that time is really short yeah it's like 10 seconds for sure it's i mean i think it's probably like a nanosecond like it is it is a ragged edge you've got to dance on

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:13]** got it but also that like that bite it's a good crunch but it's airy and light it's got that cinnamon sugar on the inside and the milk tastes good afterward it's just a great it's a great cereal


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:18]** I still have, and I know better, but I still have, like, a heavy pour with milk.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:24]** I always pour it until the cereal rises, as opposed to, like... You go, like, two-thirds max.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I'm trying to learn it, but it's just hard.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:31]** I do, like, fill the cap with the milk and then dump that in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I want, like, the least amount of milk possible.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** That's actually a technical way to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:40]** You're supposed to... What's crazy is I learned the cheat code from my six-and-a-half-year-old daughter.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** You ready?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Yeah.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:58]** yeah she wants her cereal dry in a bowl she wants a cup of milk separate so that she can progressively like add the milk as she eats the cereal that's she's maintaining the law that you add the milk to the cereal and not the cereal okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** Which my wife violates constantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** You do add coffee to milk.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** That would break the timeline.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** That would break the timeline, yeah.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Okay, what about boo bears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Wait, what?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** You add coffee to milk?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Always.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** What?

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** Yeah.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Cream, cream.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** You just like slip that right in.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** Dude, you put the milk in the glass first, then pour the coffee in.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Then you don't have to worry about this stirrer.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Bulls of crap.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:28]** and using a stirrer and putting this thing.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** No, I do that too.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** It lets itself.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** You have to learn how much you put in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** There is a line of demarcation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** So you're talking about just coffee and milk.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** You're not talking about cereal with coffee because that's what I heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** I heard pouring your coffee.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:46]** That's actually not a super bad idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** Kevin, what lawless wasteland are you describing right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** Maryland.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Freaking Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:04]** With my coffee, I usually pour just like, I'll pour like a quarter of the cup of coffee.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Yeah.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** And then the coffee again.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** And then mix it.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** Because I hate when everything settles on the bottom.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** It's like when you're trying to mix a protein shake.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:23]** If you do the milk and then the powder, it's too bubbly.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:26]** If you do the powder and then the milk, then you get a bunch of sludge at the bottom.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:31]** But if you do milk and then powder and then a little more milk, you get the proper...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:57]** yeah yeah average this is this is the way do you guys remember in the boxes in the cereal boxes back when um by the way captain crunch for the win and then uh do you remember they had cd roms they had like always exchange colors they had like toys they had everything i don't think that's done anywhere uh upc labels to get stuff sent yes yeah you would you would buy one box

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:03]** I was just saying, well, you buy one box of cereal, you get an entire video game that you can play forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** The Captain Crunch video game was really cool.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** I think they stopped putting them in the cereal.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:13]** It used to be in the cereal, but people actually choked on those because they were just like, eat from the box and then swallow the mini.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Then they started putting them outside the box.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:23]** The CD-ROM just goes into your mouth and you just swallow it down your gullet and then you're like, you're done.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** You're just working to recover.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** Some people listening might not know what a CD-ROM is.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** I mean, like, that's crazy.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Start by the short time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Yeah, anyway, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** Okay, yeah, sorry.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** It's weird.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** It's a weird flavor.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** Like, you know how you have, like, Legos, then you have, like, Duplo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** It's like... I can't wait to hear where you're going with this, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Yeah, please.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Okay, so there's, like, normal sugar-tasting things, and then weird sugar-tasting things, right?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** And then, like, Boo Berries were in that category.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** You have, like, Legos, and then you have, like, Duplo, like, f***y Legos.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Like, it's like... I mean...

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** It's different, that's all I'm saying.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** You can't combine them together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** Isn't Duplo a Lego brand?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** Yes.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** So Duplo is their, like... Okay, sorry, Mega Bloks.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** It's the kids.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yeah, Mega Bloks.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Mega Bloks.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Also, K'nex.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Classic.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, K'nex.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** And then Die Too Young.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** Remember, like, Perfect Blocks?

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** Whatever they're called, the ones that, like, wrapped around the head.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** K'nex did Die Too Young.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:48]** Am I the only one here who had an Erector set?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Oh, an Erector set!

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** That would be really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:57]** Hey, can I just list, because now I have some headcanon that we should do a one-shot about this.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** There are six monster serial characters.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:11]** Count Chocula, Frankenberry, Booberry, Fruit Brute, who is the wolf who eats fruit, Yummy Mummy, and Carmella Creeper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:17]** So we have to do a one-shot of serial characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** I'm down.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** I'm totally down.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** For Halloween, we should get together and eat them and stuff.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Yummy mummy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:24]** We should do a serial killer murder mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Oh my god.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Who did it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** I might vote for caramel.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Also, if you search yummy mummy, it's a breast pump now.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** So not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:42]** No, not the same.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** I'm not surprised by that at all.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** That tracks.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** Oh, the yummy mummy had marshmallows in it.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** That's why.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** I feel like, I feel like some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** All right.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** That's cool.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** That was a great, that was a fun time.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** It was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Let's play.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:02]** Also, in my headcanon, the reason why Kevin likes, what's it called?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** Lucky Charms.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** Yeah, Lucky Charms is because of the leprechaun, I feel.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:10]** Yeah, he identifies as a leprechaun.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Yeah, that's cool.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** And I want to say, for the record, don't ruin a coffee with milk.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:40]** that's very wow okay like john do you actually put regular milk and coffee you're not supposed to you're supposed to put cream and coffee i do like you put milk right oh okay i put oatmeal i don't cream because like just i don't want all that stuff so i got you wow wow yeah will i see you on that hill from our hill yeah people putting cream and like red wine what what the fuck


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** I've never heard of that, but I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** But go with me here.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:49]** Why does cream work in coffee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** It cuts down the bitter and thickens it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** I'm bringing back the... Thank you.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** Sorry.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:06]** From a chemistry perspective, it neutralizes the tannins because the protein in the lactose product...

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:35]** is broken down by the acids in the beverage and so it changes the flavor profile those same acids are present in red wine as are in coffee and so like cream in fall red wine mellows it out just like it does coffee and so like there are there is a subset of humans i'm not among them but there is a subset of humans that puts cream in their red wine for those exact same reasons i'll try it i would try it yeah yeah i'm with will i would just drink better red wine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** Sure.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** You can get the really, really sweet kind that Kevin and I like that's basically juice.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** I think it's like a Stella, that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:46]** Stella, the fruit juice, the Capri Sun of wine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Whatever it's called.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:50]** Plush for my fellow Floridians.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** San Sebastian.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** San Sebastian.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Muscadine grapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** It's one of the few wines that does muscadine grapes.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Florida has grapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** What is a muscadine grape?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Love this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:09]** I'm afraid to look up anything we talked about now that you're Yummy Mummy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** I want to see somebody tell me about their cream and wine experience.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** I'm going to try to not barf.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:25]** I learned something on our trip to Tennessee for John's bachelor party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:32]** All right, I'm going to start the music one more time, but we really should get started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Guys, come on.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:39]** I went to dinner and drinks with my coworkers last week, and my one coworker ordered a whiskey.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** I think it was McAllen 12 or something.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:46]** And he splashed a small amount of water into it.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** And my other coworker, just a small amount.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** And my other coworker was like, oh, it was too strong for him.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:55]** And I was like, well, no, he's opening up the flavors and creating that.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:02]** And I was proud of myself for remembering and understanding what was going on with that process.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** High five.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Thank you, whiskey people.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Except for Benny.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** He's not.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** I just want to call it out for the audio listeners.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Yeah, I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** It probably wasn't McCallum that he splashed.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** It was probably cream.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:37]** my dad swears by a splash of water in his scotch and his bourbon and his whiskey and i just that flavor profile like the way it opens up the flavors is so bad to my palate i can't i support anyone

**[00:17:37 - 00:18:04]** enjoying beverages however they enjoy them even with cream it ruins it so terribly for me i'm sorry i brought i brought like a hundred dollar bottle of bourbon for thanksgiving and i walked away and came back and my dad had like four cubes of ice in his cup oh yeah it hurts my soul okay hey man he is he is enjoying i agree ice i don't like in whiskey but you know water okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Ice is fun.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Ice is the opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** No, there's no apologies.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** Do we all feel like we got it all out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** We should try.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** In a good way.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:20]** We're having a good time.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** We're having a good time.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** Never going to not enjoy bantering with you four.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Thank you for that, Kelly.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** That was a nice little sound bite.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** That was good.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:34]** I want to just take a second and say that I made...

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Uh-oh.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** You want to know why?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Really?

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** How?

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** I did.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** Well, one, because I didn't actually want this music.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** This is not what I want.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** I want this music.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:50]** No, because I said, hey, why don't we name this adventure We'll Save the Mini Venture.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:57]** And I missed out on just the biggest sign that this should be We'll Save the Nano Venture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:17]** oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that is perfect that was always the name it was always the name and i just i yeah we didn't know we didn't know so now officially be that's the yeah i mean it's another testament to our powers combined


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Captain Nano.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:41]** So we started last episode with just a callback to your callous base and the narrative in the Threefold Conspiracy as Rick19 was getting checked out.

**[00:19:41 - 00:20:05]** for his medical exam and getting ready to get a little debrief with dr nodens and as part of it rick 19 sees the eye check and sees the white light across the eyes and something on his head clicks and he forgets about ducal space

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:20]** And we opened up on four individuals walking into a medical facility to receive their final injection of nanites or nanocytes.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Is it nanites or nanocytes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:27]** A nanocyte is the person, the nanobots.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Okay, but the nanite is the bots.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:36]** Nanobot and nanite are kind of interchangeable, but nanocyte is the... Well, got it.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Thank you.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:43]** So you're getting your final injection of nanites, and I wanted to take this moment as we're recapping Last Step...

**[00:20:44 - 00:21:02]** first step of we'll say the nano venture, uh, to also provide some context a bit more for the four of you, because you all brought in some fantastic characters in Cara Valtara and Cecil Remy and Migo seven and boom.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** And I'm sure the thought might have crossed your mind.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Why are you there?

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:12]** I mean, it became clear that you were receiving your final injection of nanobots.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** You've been there before.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** You've gotten your introductory first and second injection.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** This is the final, the greatest amount.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:26]** Because you all have said, whatever my career was in the past, some of you have a very storied past.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** You can tell from some of the scars and the way you carry yourselves.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:36]** That you all are dedicated to the protection of Morrow and bad ass.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** And an opportunity has come up.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Why you took it.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Maybe we'll find out.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Maybe we won't.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:48]** But an opportunity came up to become a member of the STARS team.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Thank you, Kev.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** Bless you.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:56]** The Special Tactics and Raid Squadron, which in effect are a SWAT group.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:07]** You are called in for situations that typical officers would not be capable of handling or dealing with.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** In this case...

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:18]** after your time at just joining the group, coming in with your final injection, we jumped a year ahead, right?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:25]** And you were brought in, the STARS group is part of the

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:34]** It's sponsored by the Goldvein Census, who I talked about was an arbiter and network of temples, one of the big economic drivers in Akiton and across the packed worlds in general.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** So that security and idea was led by them.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** This is your understanding as characters.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** And was also financed in part by Ringworks Industries.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:55]** So you have been for the past year working on the newly freshly minted SWAT Starscript.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:07]** For just to give you all some context that has been a few situations that were, let's call them relatively straightforward and easy.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** You did not need to use maybe as many of your talents.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:16]** They didn't quite match up and you weren't needed to, but you were called in and you helped save the day.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** One of the things lately though, in the past six months,

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:34]** You all have particularly been successful in uncovering and helping to deal with a rash string of kidnappings.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** The thing is...

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:50]** When you find where that... I'm totally lost for words.

**[00:23:52 - 00:24:03]** Whenever you are close to infiltrating wherever these hostages, those who've been kidnapped, have been, then there's always a missing piece.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:10]** Either the person who was kidnapped or people who were kidnapped.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** They are not there, but the perpetrators are.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:18]** Or sometimes the kidnappers are there and the perpetrators are not.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:32]** But you've been successful enough that even though this has garnered a lot of headlines, it's known that you all will be the front line to find the individuals or at least bring those who did it to justice.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:47]** So that's the history that you four have brought into the Akatonian Museum of History on this holiday, right?

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:57]** The day of Solar's Edge, the last day that the sun will dip below the surface of the trench in tomorrow.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** I want to pause there and just ask if you guys have any questions.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Is there anything that I can tell you?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yeah.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Okay.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** Well, I, I can't answer all of them, but I just want to take a minute and, you know, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:19]** Uh, you said, so we're at the last six months we've been, um, working on these, this like string of kidnappings.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:26]** And then you said, but it's never both the kidnappers and the victims.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** It's one or the other are missing.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** And it's been across different gangs.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:53]** Morrow, part of maybe your remit before joining SARS was dealing with some of the criminal life in Morrow and understanding it, understanding the politics that are happening and trying to make Morrow a safer place, whatever that may mean in a good way and in a bad way.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** And so-

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:00]** The thing is that every time that there's been something, it's never been the same perpetrator, which is odd.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** Also, why is my music not playing?

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Does that help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:08]** No, it just makes things more confusing.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** Okay, cool.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** Just to clarify, it's never the same perpetrator twice.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:24]** And whenever we go to a scene, we find either the victims and no perpetrator or the perpetrator and no victims.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:29]** How do we know it's a perpetrator and no victim without a victim?

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** Is that a question to me or is that a question to you?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** That's just a general question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:39]** Because the line of evidence seems to follow that like they were there.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:46]** It's just that and the evidence follows that you found the right people who did it.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:55]** But even though some of you may some other members of not stars, but the security group in general may take on the case from there to find them.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** They don't.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:00]** But it feels like a cold case after that, because all the evidence led to exactly where it was there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:11]** And there's no evidence of where either the perpetrator or the... Yeah, there's no disappearing... There's no goo.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** No.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Ectoplasm.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:21]** No, like, disappearing cabinet thing that we open up and find, like... Yeah, yeah, there's a tank of water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Yeah, there's a mirror that you just walk into.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** No.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** No room of requirement.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:34]** No, but keep in mind that you all are brought in for these special events.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:43]** So if that's something that if there is more information to come, it could come from security or could be unveiled as time goes on.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Maybe we'll see.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** At this event?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** No, just in general.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Who knows what will happen in the nano venture?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** So any other questions?

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** How many beans?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** Great question.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** Great question.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** And what do I win?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** You're not going to find out right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** What's the hierarchy of our four-person squad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** Who's in charge?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** That's a very, very good question.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:23]** And actually something that I probably should have asked you before off air, but we can either cut this part or determine in general.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** I would like to leave that up to you.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:29]** You all correct me if I'm wrong.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** You have Commander Bolt.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:36]** I think you would have some there.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:42]** You have Lieutenant Lua, who's not really with who's still with stars, but it's not really like on your team.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:48]** So between the four of you, maybe people who here who know more about SWAT hierarchy would know.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** It seems like you would have probably a sergeant and three officers.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Is that right?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Is my understanding correct?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:18]** i don't know so maybe you're too deep maybe you're too deep you have like a lieutenant a sergeant and then two officers right there's a master like squadron leader is the thing yeah yeah somebody who's who is who is not the commander so who would like to be that leader is there anybody that feels like they want to take that on

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** I feel like Kara would, but... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** Yeah.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** I mean, Miko... She's also local.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Miko absolutely wouldn't.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:30]** He's the hammer.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** He's the muscle.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:39]** He's the... I'm going to say this, and I was not in service, so this is going to be based on what I've seen on YouTube and the internet.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:44]** He's the E6 mafia of the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:44 - 00:30:11]** all right yeah boom wouldn't be wouldn't be in charge of that i feel okay yeah okay okay cool so so like it's car is car is the leader like the the official leader and migo is like the experienced veteran but lets car take charge yeah he just gets done he's like all right car wants this to happen i'm gonna make it happen yeah

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Okay.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** The Ysokis are just hanging out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** They're just having a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** He has, over time, earned the moniker The Hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Put that in place.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** Yeah, that's a big note right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** That's classic us.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** It's classic us.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** Yeah.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:48]** All right, let's move back to the Akatoni Museum of History.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Rewind, rewind, rewind.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:57]** Where you all have come in and been uncomfortable kind of from the start.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:06]** Kara was standing kind of off to the side, talking a bit with the commander and with Lua, and then Miko and...

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Boom.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:16]** And Cecil went over to get some swag, guessing the beans with Mari Morrow herself, who was there asking you how many beans do you have?

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** think are in this jar.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** You're having a good time.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:25]** There's music playing and you know that you're there because you are going to be celebrated for your success.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:37]** And as a reminder, you're at the Rings to Life Ringworks Industries charity auction, you know, in the back of the room, there's some food, there's the relics that you can go, you know, place a bid on.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** I don't, I get the feeling none of you are placing a bid there.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** But some people are, you know,

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** It's a lively atmosphere.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:52]** Again, it is to celebrate the holiday, the charity, and a bit of you.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:06]** As you're talking to have a good time, there is a human who steps up halfway up the staircase at the front of the room, in front of the beautiful view that you can see of Morrow.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Steps up and says, ding, ding, ding, ding.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Will did a good job of that last time.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** Ding, ding.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** We'll follow you later.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Excuse me.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Excuse me.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** Could I have your attention, please?

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Thank you.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** I am Aldred Law.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:40]** I am the Outreach Coordinator with Ringworks Industries, and it is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to our newest event, the Rings to Life Auction for Charity.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** There's a pause for...

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** Very good girls, yeah.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Wow.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** There are so many more people.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** It's a large crowd.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:59]** We're very proud of our commitment to the Morrow community.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:03]** We're very humbled and gracious to be able to be in this beautiful space.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** This is incredible.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** At the Actonian Museum of History.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:14]** Like I said, we are dedicated to helping cure the incurable.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** And...

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:29]** Our commitment to the Morrow community for the past year, it has been one of our top priorities, both for Ringworks on Akiton and Ringworks as a whole across the Pact Worlds.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:44]** I would not be – or I would be remiss if I, of course, didn't share and mention our wonderful collaborators that we are working with, the additional sponsors here for Gamut Bio.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** There's a sprinkling of applause.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:54]** For the nonprofit Garden of Eden – there's another little clap –

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** And also for the humanitarian aid for Akitan.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** And there's like one or two claps.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:08]** Now, before I go any further, I would like to, well, she doesn't need any introduction.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** I do want to give a very, very warm welcome.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:23]** Please join me in welcoming our Morrow on Akiton CEO, Leora Huxley, everybody.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:28]** And the three screens up in front,

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:55]** darken just a little bit and then this image comes up in front there of the top half of a hilky woman the face you can see that her long hair cascades over one shoulder across her formal armor set it's a it's a staple of traditional acatonian custom wear

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** She has this smile on her face.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:05]** I want to ask, do you think any of you would recognize her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Yeah, Kara would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Okay.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yeah.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** What?

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Because she's a Hilkey?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** No, not because she's a Hilkey.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:22]** I'm just thinking... She has come into the community recently, like I said, the past year, as they've been building and setting up their infrastructure.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** Sounds like Kara would, for sure.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** And I think...

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:43]** You might recall in the back of your mind that at one of the very early meetings a year ago, you might have seen her at your local facility, at your local precinct, just stopping by.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:48]** Or maybe heard that she was there, just wanting to come in and see.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** FaceTime.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Support.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Yeah.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Get some FaceTime.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** See where they have put their money towards.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:05]** Hello, all good business leaders of Morrow, government officials, our gold-veined security heads.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:15]** I am so honored, truly, for Ringworks to give back to the community that accepted us just a year ago.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:22]** The causes that Ringworks supports are always at our core principle of circularity.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** That what you give always comes back to you.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:45]** Now, this is why we have worked so hard to foster with developers, community engagement, and many plenty of late nights trying to figure out what is the best thing that we could do.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:53]** So as you know, we've started this Rings for Life charity in support of our new presence here.

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:01]** The hardworking contractors of Morrow have built an incredible state-of-the-art Ringworks Industries office here.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:06]** And we are just very dedicated to being present in the communities at all times.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** She pauses as if she's about to say her next sentence.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** And her eyes look away from the camera.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Excuse me.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** Hello, sorry, you can't be here.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:25]** I'm not sure what you're doing, but I'm afraid that you... Please put that away.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** And she starts to step off of the screen.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:42]** And as Leora backs out of the screen, the barrel of a gun comes into the screen, followed by an armored and helmeted figure.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:51]** that comes and is looking off screen at Leora, looks over to the camera, and then the feed cuts short.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:56]** I want you all to give me a perception check.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** Perception.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** My perceptions.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Give me that perception check right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** I got a 20.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** 30.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** 11.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:08]** Okay, you got an... Sorry, Kara got a 20.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Migo got an 11.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Migo got an 11.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** What about Boom or Cecil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Cecil comes up the rear with an 8 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** With an 8?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Okay.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** And what about Boom?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Give me just a second, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Technical issues.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:29]** There's a hush in the crowd as soon as the gun came through.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:38]** There was a pause, but as soon as that came through and then the feed cut short... Boom, give me that when you get a sec, because...

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** Kara... Of course it's Kara.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:51]** Kara notices that two individuals... Sorry, three have walked out of the shadows of the right entrances.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** Two have walked out of the left.

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:01]** And the one on the left is dressed in similar armor, but their face is exposed.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:09]** And as soon as their light, as the sunlight of Morrow hits their face, you hear...

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** The perfect future demands payment.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** Leora Huxley will die with the last light of the sun.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** The stars will pay with a life.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** The gate will be satisfied.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:32]** And then in unison, all four voices say, for tomorrow I see.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:35]** And you need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** 26 on perception.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Right there at the very end.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Hey, what's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** What are we doing?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** All right.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Let me go ahead and get this set up.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Okay.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** Hold your initiatives right there.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** I got to get this all set up.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** You know, good stuff.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Good stuff.

**[00:39:59 - 00:39:59]** Yeah.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** You know, just your typical gala event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Yeah.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** I mean, this is par for the course for us at this point.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** I mean, we are like amazing heroes, right?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Right.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** These moments happen all the time, these movie moments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** You have been doing great.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** You've been doing real good.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:25]** Alright, let me pull my hero lab off to the side here as I begin to ask you to both put your... Oh, I gotta put everything in combat state here.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:30]** And then I can let you all jump into what's going on here.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Sorry for the delay.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** What did he shout?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Something about predicting tomorrow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Yeah.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Give me one second and I will tell you.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:41]** What did everyone get for their initiative?

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** 14.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Kara, what did you get?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** 17.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** 17.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Love it.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Migo, what did you get?

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** 6.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Migo got a six.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** And Cecil, you said that you also got a 17?

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Yeah.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** I have a plus zero initiative, though.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** So then Caro will go first.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** And then Boom, what did you get?

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** 14 for Boom.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:27]** 14 for boom okay boom right now i need to also uh roll for these feller people and then go from there and then we should be good i think it is going to be at the top of the round oh this is great

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:40]** There is a creature in the left of the screen that, on your turns, you may be able to do a check to see what they are going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Or see, sorry, who they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** What the hell?

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Oh, it looks cool.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** The Hanukkah attended.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** Hanukkah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:57]** This dinosaur-looking creature, sort of, is...

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:20]** has i would say it's probably like close to maybe four or five feet tall and has a very very long neck and has this this frill of blue and red at the top of their head they look like a velociraptor but with like maybe you know longer arms and wearing armor they are sapient

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:26]** And this creature is going to... Let's see, what do I want to do here?

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** Kara's over on the other side of the museum.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:34]** Actually, all three of you are... All four of you are on the right side of the museum.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Three of you are down near the swag station.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:42]** And one of you is over on the... Near the four-legged dinosaur.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** So...

**[00:42:45 - 00:43:06]** this creature is going to it was here it's going to double move and run over let's see to right below the big dinosaur in the center and that's gonna be actually yeah that's gonna be their turn cara valtara's turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** What are you doing?

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:13]** Kara is going to look at the purple-looking foe.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:17]** Purple-dressed foe.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Are they armed?

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** What's going on?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Can I roll a perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Go ahead and give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:30]** I got a 20.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** 24.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** 24.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:42]** They seem like they are armored in gear armor.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** That's, let's say, not congruous.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:56]** I would say with the 24, you can see that the one in the top right corner of the space is wearing different armor from the one who's at the center of the space.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:02]** But there is an attempt to make it black and slightly different and dark colored.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:08]** But for the most part, it's pretty... Do they have weapons or...

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:12]** Yeah, they are both carrying pistols.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** Okay.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:26]** So Kara's going to attempt, she's going to move up, and she's going to take out her tactical standard tack lash.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:38]** Which gives her a bonus to a combat maneuver, as well as she has improved... She has some feats for combat maneuvers.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:42]** She's going to attempt to disarm with... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:42 - 00:45:04]** the standard attack lash in one eight okay what is the role that you need to hit and what's the dc for that that so it's uh i believe it's 20 plus the creature rating 20 plus the creature rating okay all right so give me your role for that yeah and i have a plus seven so okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** You also get reach with that, right?

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Sorry?

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** You also get reach with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Yes, that's why I'm within 10 feet.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Yeah, that's why you're 10 feet.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** I rolled another 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Another 24.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** That just gets it.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** What?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Impressive.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:27]** So, yeah, so your tack lash, tell me how it disarms the... I would imagine it's like Indiana Jones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Nice.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Nice.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:35]** You know, so many of a movie, basically, she drops it and just flings.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:43]** And today she ate her Wheaties and it hit perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Amazing.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Yeah.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** The gun.

**[00:45:45 - 00:46:04]** that flies out of their hand landing in the in the square next to them and you see the confusion as they came in ready to fight and you moved before they could even do anything and took the gun out of their hand incredible yeah and she's gonna tell the other guys like get off this get out of the swag table get in the fight

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:28]** nice okay okay and that's our turn i think all righty uh let's see it is a two things happen one is that uh i realized that i could move with this uh creature further so i'm just gonna move a bit further than where i was before and if that's okay with you guys because i just didn't read their speed

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:41]** And then at the same time, I will tell you, just to give you some context, people are looking around confused, but some of them have started to already disperse.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:53]** You don't need a perception check to hear Lua and Commander Bolt starting to guide some people out to make sure that at least as quickly as possible, anybody else who is not there disperse.

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:09]** is going to uh trying to like get them out because there seems to be some sort of a situation happening here i think i need a roll for damage oh with this arm tell me tell me more uh i just see that it's like 1d4 damage and i think that's part of it lay it on me yeah

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:30]** yeah lay it on just one just one point of damage that's it uh cool okay one point of damage as the tack lash just leaves a cut in the hand it just knocked it out of hand and yeah yeah it stings there's like a ah to it all right cool cool i like it i like it

**[00:47:30 - 00:48:00]** thank you Hero Lab I've never used Hero Lab for like tracking things before so thanks for Hero Lab for helping track all this stuff cool well done it is going to be the individual who's in the middle here on the second down entrance on the right side they are coming out they're between Kara and the three of you and I am curious where they are going to go first let's find out

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:13]** okay they are going to so boom hope that you have a good AC I'm not sure what armor you decided to take here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Just saying.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** That's a really good question.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** What's armor?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Yeah.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Armor?

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** I've never used armor before in my life.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Okay.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:28]** That is going to be on you a... Cool.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** 18.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Yeah, that does pass.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** That does pass through?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** Okay.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Yeah.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Including armor.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** So...

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:39]** Maybe you all hear Kara shouting, hey, you need to spring and get into action.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:47]** And right as that happens, boom, you get hit with four points of fire damage.

**[00:48:47 - 00:49:15]** and then his voice modulator kicks back in again he's like oh he has a voice that one did hurt love it love it and then they are going to move i think past yeah they're they start stepping into where there's a bunch of people nearby and that after that's going to be cecil's turn what are you doing cecil


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** All right, I just need some clarification.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:22]** So there are six of these perpetrators?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Five?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** There's five.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** Where are they on the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Okay, so yeah.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:32]** So there's one directly in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Right, I see that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Yep.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** There is one, the one that shot, boom.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** That's like in the other walkway.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** There's the one that Kara is fighting.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** So those three are in a line on the right.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:48]** And then there is the one who is shouting over in the far left corner.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:57]** And then there is this dinosaur-looking creature that is to your left, maybe 30 or 40 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:01]** But the dinosaur creature you said is a part of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:22]** this group or they started running towards you but you didn't you said that it's not clear that they are a part of that i did not say that if i said that i did not mean to intimate that we got bogeys all around us what man okay i'm

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:48]** little torn on this one because what are the civilians doing like there's a guy right in front of me yeah i just haven't moved them because i'm not trying to move them in real time i'm going to give them a round to kind of move out but they are starting to move there there are the the commander and lua are are starting to get people out on the other side and the people on this side are starting to move away i just haven't updated it

**[00:50:48 - 00:51:07]** enter the map so don't go by what the map says people are moving around they are trying to leave and it seems like these people are not attacking okay um yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:17]** Cecil is going to step back, kind of up and around.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:24]** He's new at this still, and he's still the rookie of the team.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:32]** When that guy comes off to the right, he was ready to attack, so he pulls out his pike staff.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** It's a pike.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** I just said staff.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** It's an axe on a pike.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Or on a staff.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:48]** But he pulls out this tactical pike, but then he sees that dinosaur thing coming.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** And I think he's prioritizing that dinosaur.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** So he's going to step that way.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:58]** And yeah, I think that's all I'm going to do.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** I forget if I can stand defensively or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** You want to take the defensive action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** I don't know if I can as an action or if it's a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Okay.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:14]** I'll get back to you on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Okay.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** All right.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** But that's what you're going to do right now.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** Yeah.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Okay.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Cool.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** All right.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** It is Boom's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** What are you doing, Boom?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:41]** so boom uh boom is going to uh aim his uh he takes well his gun is like the size of his entire body so he basically just like pulls it off and like leans it on his shoulder and uh his squad machine gun he fires it at who was it that attacked him again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:48]** That was the individual who is now in the middle of the... They are walking to like 30 feet directly above you and they are walking towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Directly above me, you say?

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** I don't see anyone above.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** You mean north on the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Yes.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:04]** So if you see where Cecil is and then you see there's a group of people standing there and there's one person directly in the middle that I'm pinging and you should be able to see them.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** That's the person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** I see the cluster of people now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** All right, cool.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:27]** so um all right boom is going to um move to the uh left uh to sort of not have like soft cover or whatever from cecil fair and then uh will he be able to uh hit from here it looks like it should be okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:48]** with no penalties what's the range 60 feet 60 feet i'm more concerned about like coverage or uh cover or whatever with this yeah i mean i think people are crab situation yeah the dead crab is that like uh is is that like it's like a podium that you're walking through it's it's it's not you have no cover or consume it you're fine okay brilliance all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** Boom, like, gets down on one knee.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** And he's lit.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** That was a big mistake.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** And then he rolls for... to hit.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** This is a squad machine gun.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** It is pretty dope.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** So, um, it...

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** I'm just going to unload.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** It's a five to hit, though.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** God dang it.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Okay, I want to be clear.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** I'm a soldier again, which is not my favorite thing to do, but it fits Boom.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:18]** So I didn't learn my lesson from Thaddeus, and I rolled a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:23]** I don't think we have a single magic wielder or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:47]** on this squad guys we did it again you did it again this is the worst good thing your shots blow out your shots blow out the supporting legs of the crab in front of you and it falls over and the and the crab fossil explodes so you've destroyed a piece of history yeah that's unfortunate


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Amazing.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** All right.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** All right.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** All right.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Love it.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Love it.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Love it.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** The worst squad they've ever heard of.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** But you have heard of us.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** But it's happened that you've heard of us before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Love it.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Amazing.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** All right.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:05]** Kara, this purple lined figure.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** reacts quickly, adapts quickly.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** The pistol is gone.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:19]** Their other hand pulls out this switchblade, which is, you know, to be easily concealable, analog weapon.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:24]** They clearly seem to be very good and adept at using it.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** And they are going to step forward and swing at you.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** And that is a dirty 20 to hit you.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** That hits.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Okay.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** But... Okay, go ahead.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Just roll your damage.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:43]** Six points of slashing damage as this thing comes in to slash at your arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:59]** So as this foe comes in to slash, Cara kind of takes like a... I actually, I know there is a way that I can do a guarded step, but I think that's only if I get hit when...

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Oh no, this is it.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** Will's butt always makes me really happy.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:13]** I know, but... So I took the dispersal... Oh, that's cool.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:21]** So I get a reactive spray and this damage reduction defensive dispersal.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:26]** So when I take damage, reduce the damage by four...

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:31]** And I get a plus one circumstance bonus to any saves.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:36]** If there's like a save associated with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** Okay.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** Yeah, there's not a save associated with it.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** But, sorry, you're saying that you can reduce damage by four.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Yes.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** That is rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:51]** It's a nanosite skill that when you're attacked, it either hardens or separates in a way that protects you.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** Yeah.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** That's so freaking cool.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** You can do nanosite level plus your constitution or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** That's so cool.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** I love that.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:06]** I'm trying to see if I want to do that or if I want to do the reactive spray, which I also have, which is...

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Okay.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:11]** Basically forms like an extra cloud array for free.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Okay.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** I think I'm going to do the DR, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** You're going to do the DR?

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Yeah.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Okay.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:19]** So that's only two points of damage to Kara Altara.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** What does that look like as the blade comes to slash?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:32]** I think as the, it would just disperse as this sort of like, he cuts away at something that then it's like the Sandman and like Spider-Man, right?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:43]** Like it's just, you know, a blob of a cloud of nanites dispersed in such a way that like, yeah, no, no effect or little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** I love it.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** Yeah, so that's two points of damage.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** And then that's it.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Okay.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Good stuff.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** Good counter.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:56]** Love starting to use the nanite features early on.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** Why not?

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Dig into it in this nano adventure.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:06]** Migo, what is your 6'3 butt doing right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** I think Migo is only marginally surprised.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Okay.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** Of course.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** Nothing gets by you.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Nothing surprises him.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:24]** And so I think, you know what?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** I'm going to roll the dice.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:35]** Because Migo, and by Migo I mean Vinny, is torn between going after Dino Nugget over there or the dude right next to him.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:40]** And so we'll say 1-10 is Dino Nugget, 11-20 is the guy next to me.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:47]** And that's a 17, so this poor chap to his right, to the east of Migo.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:53]** Anyone who's looking, and I don't know whether the rest of the squad is looking because most of the threats are away from him.

**[00:58:53 - 00:59:22]** we'll now see why he gets the moniker the hammer and so as he steps toward this bogey to the east he takes a big shrug and you see his right arm transform you see the cells start to reproduce and the nanites infuse and it's a dash ko but with like electricity arcing off of it wow

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:37]** that's cool yeah Migo is an evolutionist and so there it is he gets some really like I'm so jazzed to play this class right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:42]** I, y'all, y'all are doing such just like cool.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** I was excited when I saw you were doing evolutionist.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** I'm very curious about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Me too.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:59]** Um, he walks over and says, you, you crashed the wrong party bump and swings his electric Josh go for, uh, it's a 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** 17 will definitely hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:10]** So him being the sort of intimidating hammer he is, he doesn't swing for center of mass.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** He swings for the kneecaps.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** He wants to send a message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:26]** And so he connects with his left kneecap, and you hear that kneecap shatter for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:47]** yeah absolutely that is 10 um electric damage oh my god nice wow i don't know if all you were looking at migo but you heard the scream from the individual that migo just shattered their lower body we weren't looking but we are now

**[01:00:47 - 01:01:04]** you are now you are now wow that is uh yeah okay cool amazing it is their turn so uh great turn did you want to do anything else that's a move that's an attack i think i am all turned out

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** You're all turned out.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** OK, sounds good.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** They will.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:21]** I think that they're going to take a guarded step, I think, because their body obviously like just got totally smashed.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** And so they take a step and my foundry is not letting me take that step.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:29]** And they are going to, as they take that step, a guarded step away from you, they're going to swing at you.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** And that's a 24 to hit you with their tactical switchblade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Try it again.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:39]** Because it looks like it paused for just a second when you're trying to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Yeah, that was me trying to undo it.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** How does 24 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** 24 definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:49]** So that's going to be six points of damage as they, like...

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:57]** try to lean into the fact that all this pain has pushed them off to the right, and they step over and try and swing at you at the same time.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** Is it six damage?

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Six damage, yeah.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** Things are starting to heat up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** With that strike, you see...

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:16]** Mio's eyes, which are normally like a standard hazel color, change to bright red.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Like glow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:20]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Amazing.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:24]** Is that a mechanical thing or is that a racial thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** It's interesting.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:36]** It's a little calm A, a little calm B. A little calm A, a little calm B. It's a mechanical thing, but I waited too long to blow it out, so I'm just going to use that in the narrative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** Yeah, that's cool.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:37]** I like it.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** I like it.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** It is almost the end of the round.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** Most everybody is leaving the room.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Dr. O'K.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Dr. O'K.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:44]** Darn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** Car of Altara.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:57]** Can I get you something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:04]** I'll take world's worst pickup lines for a thousand, Alex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** Yeah, that's absolutely it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** That is absolutely that.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** Oh, man.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Viscous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:24]** You have just been successfully, you've mostly thwarted the attack from this individual in front of you.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:34]** And there's a brief moment where whatever thought you have in your head disappears.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:41]** And you are, there's like a silence kind of for like the first time.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:51]** And the voice in your head says, you aren't supposed to move right now.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** And that's our game.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** What?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:57]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** A voice in Kara's head?

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** Is it like my internal voice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:02]** Kara's head says, you aren't supposed to move.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:08]** It's the same voice of the individual who shouted out at the very beginning.
