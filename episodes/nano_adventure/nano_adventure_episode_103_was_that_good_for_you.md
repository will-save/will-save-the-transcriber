## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:22]** Hello and welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:21]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** We'll Save the Podcast!

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:29]** I am your barking GM, John Swan, and I want to keep today's banter tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Just grab it.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** Keep it tight.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Dude, do we really want to keep it tight?

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:36]** Because that's why like 20% of the people will just listen to us for banter reasons, John.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** I disagree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** I think it's like 50%.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** People like Banner.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Yeah, of course they do.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** I'm not saying they don't.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** But now Kelly's just trying to keep it going longer.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** I see what you're doing there, Kelly.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** I like the banter.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** It's fun.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I do too.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** It's the only time we get to catch up with you guys.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** We don't actually catch up beforehand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:02]** We all hate each other in real life and then it makes us talk to each other.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** It's corner-pointed time that we have to spend together.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** It's corner-pointed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** This show is corner-pointed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** It's too good.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** You are the obligated GM, John Swan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** Half our listeners are also corner-pointed to listening to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:50]** thank you parole officers yeah that's so good this is my community service time look question about your characters get into the mindset I know it's kind of early we haven't had banter feels a little raw but just question I don't like that this has not been prepared but go ahead what have you enjoyed most about your characters what's that

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** What have you enjoyed most about the characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:02]** I think what I most enjoyed was knowing how Kevin feels when you just sort of like get railroaded into like...

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:23]** like a personality or something like boom just became a desk destroyer i never like and now i can relate to kevin in this way too so it's good although i guess that happened with thaddeus too he's not like making him do a cowardly kitty which he is not but yeah

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** I like blowing stuff up.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:30]** I mean, like, I like that, and I like the cigars bit, because, you know, good for a mouse to have a cigar, I feel.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** It's kind of cute.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Yeah, that's cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** I can't wait to smoke your first cigar with you, like, for real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** Oh, I mean, yeah, we should do that in person.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Wait, you've never smoked a cigar?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** No, I have, for sure, but I've never done it with, like, you all, so.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Oh.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** And I don't smoke them often, so I'll just make a special occasion of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** I'm down.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Oh, I love a cigar.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Sounds like one or two a year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** That's basically what it's going to be.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Like one a year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** It'll be worth it.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** As long as you're wearing mouse ears when you do it.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** Specifically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** That's court ordered.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** As of now.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Swing by Mousetown on the way over.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Grab them for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** You live in Florida.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** I don't know how far you live from Mousetown, but please do.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** What is Mousetown?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** You know what?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** There it is.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** There was a visible light bulb above Kevin's head that just like...

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** His lice actually flickered in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** That's good.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:39]** We're still waiting on that upgrade from Apple for the reactions for when somebody's just like... I saw that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** You need the Neuralink and then it will tell you.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Got it.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** My daughter does this now.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** She does the hands up, like, I don't know, which is really cute.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** She doesn't know when to do it.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** She just kind of does it.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** But no, sorry.

**[00:04:52 - 00:05:00]** There was a Facebook post the other day about somebody found three mice in their Jeep when they started it up for the first time since the winter.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** And they were like, what should I do with them?

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** And one of the replies was like...

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** We have enough mice in this city.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** Just dispose of them.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** And I was like, all right.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Wait, what?

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:17]** So when you said mouse town, I was thinking like there's a town in Florida completely infested by mice, which is also plausible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** Could be really cute if it's run by mice.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:26]** Well, surprisingly, mice don't really like you don't find mice infestations down here.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** No, it's all too hot.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:32]** Reptiles and roaches get eaten by like all the reptile.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Yeah, it's too many cockroaches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** I think they get eaten.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** I think they're low enough on the food chain where they just don't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** The pythons just kind of take care of that for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:48]** I have a question for you as a Florida person, and I'm going to stereotype you.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** Is it true that baby crocodiles sound like laser bolts?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Because I've seen videos.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** They're not crocodiles, they're alligators.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Alligators, yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** They're like, pew, pew, pew.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** That's how they sound when they open their mouths.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** First thing, also, have you ever found one in your toilet before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:07]** Have you ever found... No, I've never found a reptile in my toilet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:15]** Have you ever been surprised by a swamp puppy or an anaconda or any other type of reptile, python, whatever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]** I've been surprised by like a cottonmouth, like a water moccasin before.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** Because they're like... What the f*** is that?

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I've never heard of that.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:31]** A water moccasin... They call them water moccasins because they're water snakes, but they also like... You really don't want to step on one, otherwise you'll probably...

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:52]** lose your leg or die yeah they're super very highly venomous um cotton mouths are what they're also known for because when they open their mouth it looks like they've got cotton balls because that's how fat their venom sacks are yeah yeah they just hit and they swim they swim and they swim they're the worst snake ever uh and they're all they're triple threat

**[00:06:52 - 00:07:00]** So, like, you've really got to be paying attention when you're just walking in the yard after heavy rain because they're water snakes and they go where the water goes.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** And so just be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** Just have a squishy lawn and they're just chilling out there.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Yeah.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Well, I have another question.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Okay.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** Does this question relate to what your favorite thing is about your character?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** No, it's about shoe horse crabs.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Sorry, John.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Shoe horse crabs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** And the blood being harvested from them.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Don't forget manatees.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Well, that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** But I'm wondering if Vinny's ever eaten one because I've heard that some people eat them in Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** No, I've never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** That's never been on a menu.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** No.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:30]** I was on the phone with someone from Florida and she was very upset when I asked her that question.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Cause she was like a customer service person.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Sorry.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** She asked me, how's your day?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** How's it going?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:40]** And I was like, she asked me where I was.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** She was like, I'm like, I'm like in California.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** And she's like, Oh, how's it going over there?

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** I was like, it's fine.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** And like, how's it going over there in Florida?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]** And she's like, Oh, it's good.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** And then I proceeded to ask her, like, have you ever eaten a horseshoe crab?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** And she was like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:53 - 00:08:14]** no did not like that do you know they use their blood in like yeah pharmaceutical research for pharmaceutical research their blood is bright blue it's like yeah it's so it has a higher high copper content i believe that's crazy yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:36]** yeah so my favorite thing about cecil is that he has his reach and swarmer so i i really optimize him to be like a a frontline combatant but like not a strong combatant more of just a useful combatant and i'm kind of digging that so okay not frontline okay but capable


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:54]** so your favorite part of your character is that it doesn't suck that speaks to f***ing will save right there is that our characters usually aren't good at things so then like I guess like that means that like you just had the joy of being competent at something this is uh this is uh unfair take well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** He's not wrong.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Will always incorporates really good synergy.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** Everyone else is just like, yeah, this will be fine.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** This will work.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** This will be great.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** I try.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** And then we put this party together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** My efforts are always in vain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** All of our party makeups are terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:16]** With Rick, I was like, oh, I'm going to build this quick draw sharpshooter guy.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** And then it turned into I had to be the frontline person.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** So I was like, oh, now I got to rebuild into that.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** But I can't just start over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** This is why Will saves our ass.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** Because it's not even Will's character.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** It's always Will's peripheral shit.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:37]** He'll just be like, oh, I created a briefcase that can literally do God-tier s*** somehow.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** And it's going to take care of everything that everyone else can't do.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:44]** Yes, because my drone just does that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Exactly.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** It does.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** The best part about Will is that he does it by the rules.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** Kelly's like, hey, I've got this summit grenade that is invincible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Hold on now.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Hold on.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Hold on.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** We're being positive and talking about compliments right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Whoa!

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** Order in the court here.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Order in the court.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** We're going to be assholes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** Krautty shouted out today, Kraut whatever, and he insulted your British.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Krautty.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:15]** He was like, I was listening to episode 78 or whatever, 87, and he talked about how seahorses are dumb, Kevin.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** All right.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Remember your seahorse bit?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:21]** All right, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** Any thoughts on your NanoVenture character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** All right.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Is that a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Actually, it was a question.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:28]** Yes.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Yeah.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** The question was, what is I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:42]** I enjoyed this opportunity, too, because I just want to reiterate, John, you you approached us and you were like, play a character.

**[00:10:42 - 00:11:11]** totally different from any other character you've played before i always think you should it's fun yeah and so i was like all right i'm gonna choose a female character i'm gonna choose a human uh and it's gonna be an operative and um like it's class i don't haven't played in nanosex we had to i love it you went for it yeah you're killing it yeah yeah but y'all didn't do that

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** You guys still played soldiers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** He's a grenades first guy.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** That's what I was doing.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** But you have to be a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** Anyways, I just wanted to point that out.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:27]** This feels a little bit like Judge Judy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:33]** The cases that I'm hearing here are starting to get off the rails.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** I would take it more to heart if Bernice said it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** But, you know, it's a great assault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** I get it.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** I take issue with that.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** I'm playing.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** I've never played a low charisma character before.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Okay.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** And I think that's been fun.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** That's right.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Into a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:55]** Okay, maybe I'm just singling out two people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** I have two grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** That's totally different from shooting and missing all the time.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** I was shocked when Kelly came in as a soldier, too.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:06]** Then he is playing an evolutionist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** Which was way out there for me.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Yeah.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** I've enjoyed it.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** It's really fun.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** It's just like, oh yeah, I'm just going to make this thing out of my hand.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** Kaboom!

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:45]** There is a theory by some Will Save People, I won't give it away, but there's some stuff that's floating around.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** There is.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** When I say Will Save People, some of the Willingers brought it.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** The Willing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** We love you.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** Maybe we'll get to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:02]** And if you want to join the Willing, you should join our Discord and consider supporting us on our Ko-Fi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** Wait, what's the Discord address?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:10]** It's discord.willsavethepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** As opposed to shop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:18]** As opposed to shop.willsavethepodcast.com for all your Will Save merchandise needs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** Yeah, right.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** It's at coffee.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Any way you can imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:41]** yeah and then except except with like don't don't do like Cyrillic characters or anything like that just English Latin characters and don't write onlyfans.com slash we'll say the podcast that I don't think that that works yeah not yet not yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** That is our goal.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** It's just feed pics, to be honest.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Sorry.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:50]** We did say that we're trying to start a second show on our coffee, right?

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** So, you know, could be anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** And that we are going to go live more often.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** We'll save the hot tub.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Five left feet.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:05]** You know that one jacket that we have or whatever with the five of us lined up?

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** It's just the feet, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** It's just the whole portrait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** It looks like a Monty Python.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** Do you still have that guy's number?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Yeah, let's fly to Scotland again and have him do that.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** No, he'll do it over Zoom.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** We'll just pull our feet up to the Zoom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:27]** Sit up, Chuckie B. He did ours over Zoom when we first talked to him, so he could easily do our feet over Zoom.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** He's talented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:58]** super talented guy i think we need to explain this a little bit so like the the silhouettes that we have of the five of us in a row you might have seen on our coffee or elsewhere our our our elsewheres yeah um that was done by a man the five of us were standing in a row in a line and a man used tiny scissors in an old scottish manor yeah it was amazing yeah he was really talented yeah he still is as far as i know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** R.I.P.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Rest in Port Patrick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** This is how the rumors get started.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** Right after he did ours, he dropped dead.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:20]** If you want the original, we'll auction it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** He did not.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** He did not.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** This is not true.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** This is fabrication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** My life's best is alive and well.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** It's done.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** It was just so beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** Any resemblance to persons real or imagined is purely coincidental.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** Wait, what's Vinny's?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** We didn't even talk about Vinny's.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** He just likes playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** Tell us, and then we need to get started.

**[00:15:51 - 00:16:13]** i've really enjoyed playing evolutionists um that i think i will visit again um because it's one of those like throw it at the wall and see what sticks yeah i think this would be cool how can i do it within the rules and evolutionist is flexible enough to be like yeah just you know roll this and you're good so uh it's led to some fun narrative moments being called the hammer

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:40]** um yeah it was fun and you know having a giant electric hammer come out of your right hand is also just like i really enjoy it it's a lot of fun i like it i enjoy your new york-ish accent oh yeah yeah i enjoy your your uh russian mobster accent oh thank you it's morrow's exit yeah his morrow accent that no one else from morrow has


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** That's a backstory, I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:47]** You haven't told me what that part of the backstory is.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** He spent time on a sturgeon fishing vessel in deep space.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:55]** Ran by some Russian alien.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** John, how tight was that banner for you?

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Did you enjoy how tight that was?

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Yeah, that was our longest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** 19 minutes.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** Thank you for that, Kelly.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** That was great.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** That was great.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** That was good.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** We're not going to cut any of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Kelly, you really just hit him with that.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Was that good for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** It's like the first time where someone's like, actually, I think it was a bit too long.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** I think we should have gone shorter.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:29]** You know, maybe start with a little bit more intro into the banter before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** I'll just leave the money on the dresser, Kelly, and you can leave.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** My first ever Kevin spit take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** I'm so on it right now.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** I held the spit and then it went back to my throat and now it burns in my chest.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** That's what she said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:50]** She's taking those vaccines, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:55]** Let's get playing.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** Let's get into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Nah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Nah.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** F*** it.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** We'll do it live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** All right.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Where are we?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Something was going to grab your neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** I got it, Kev.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** I got it.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:11]** Let's do a thorough recap for you all since you're so far afield.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:17]** And we need to bring you back to the Starfinder and for our listeners.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:21]** The coast has been sailed smoothly, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I'm sure they say it exactly like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** It's an old Morrow saying.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Goes back thousands of millennia.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** For our small town heroes, the Special Tactics and Raid Squadron, or STARS team.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:57]** At their recognition ceremony earlier today, they were introduced, unfortunately, to an unlikely group called the Integrated Future Front, a cult reading the descriptions of a utopian future brought back by time travelers and working at any cost to make this future real.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:00]** They ambushed your recognition ceremony.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** They stole your thunder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** Time traveling space commies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:12]** The cost this time was the life of the CEO of Ringworks, Leora Huxley, and the life of a Starz team member.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:24]** So you all suited up to kick some ass, and you all swiftly disposed of the low-level cult members waiting at the new Ringworks offices.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Why were they so easy to knock out?

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** Did they know that they may die?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Relentless...

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:37]** The Stars team discovered Leora's private office attached to her corporate office.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** And they also discovered her affiliation.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** Don't bring your work literally to your home.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Huge red flag.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** I designed that on purpose.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** Clearly.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** And her affiliation with the singularity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:57]** This whole side adventure has been a commentary on work from home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** That's all I've wanted to do.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** I'm pretty sure 80% of us work from home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** and the four-day workweek, right?

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** That's all we're trying to get to.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** And the four-day workweek, that's it.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:18]** You discover her affiliation with the Singularity Conservatory, a school for precogs that's located on the edge of a black hole's event horizon.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** You discover a secret door behind her fireplace.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** leading to a library of lore about Ringworks.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:38]** You leaf through early ship models, early business records, and the biography of one CEO in particular, Mycroft Black, a pivotal figure in the company's history.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:47]** Along with this is a calendar highlighting the dates of previous abductions that you all had solved and today's date.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:52]** You venture deeper and find a secret room

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:58]** with a large portal guarded by more IFF agents and their leader, Leora Huxley.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:20]** She informs you of your unfortunate condition that you were given nanobots that contain Mycroft Black's memories and the transference of your nanobots into new bodies means Mycroft Black can return stronger with all his memories and now the skills that you all have developed.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** The devil's bargain, though,

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:31]** is that even though you, your character's bodies will die, your families will be looked after forever into this.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:54]** utopian future sunset of course you all are like nope i'm gonna refuse that and the battle starts leora kara you traded kind and also insulting words before leora blamed you for this outcome and cast a spell on cecil you retaliated kara by tripping the once thought infallible

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Get it?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:55]** Infallible?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Leora Huxley.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** And Migo deals a crushing blow to her while on the ground.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:10]** And we ended with the VESC agent looking to hit or capture Migo with a sweet grappling forearm.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Kelly, you had a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** I was just... You said something in the beginning.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** I said a lot of things.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Yeah, you did.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** Good.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** You were like...

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** Did they know they were going to die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** It was good for me.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** I was just wondering.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** That's all I wanted to hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Good.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Did they know that they were going to die?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:33]** And I have no idea if that's related to the whole precog thing.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** It seems like you've been bringing this up a lot.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** You know what I mean?

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** And I don't know.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** I just sort of think it might become like a big thing in the real save world.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** I don't know what you mean.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** I don't.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Oh, well, fine.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** All right.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** Maybe that's just my own like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:46 - 00:23:03]** yeah i'm not sure not i it all it all comes back i'm with you kelly i'm with you because like i'm worried like i i'm wondering if he's still alive it's just doing something sneaky and nefarious and not letting all of us know what's on his mind


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:09]** The threefold conspiracy and any associated content is one of the most straightforward adventure paths ever written.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** So I think there's nothing to worry about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** I just feel like you're like dripping in precognition stuff.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:18]** And like, I wonder what it's going to mean for the larger will save universe.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** I don't know if you should cut that.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** Well, the precog thing in Rollu, like, it... Yeah.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** We don't know what time this takes place.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Yeah.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Like, this could be before Rollu passed away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Yeah.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** I just feel like precog stuff is, like, a big theme.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** That's all.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** And I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** But also, like, it's... Noted.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** You know, there's only five precogs in the entire universe, right?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** I did not know that.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** For real?

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** What is this shit?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** That was sarcasm.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Yeah, that was sarcasm.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Is that?


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:45 - 00:24:03]** kelly i truthfully like the way you're thinking and i yes there are connections as in most of the things in the threefold conspiracy and our associated anthologies right that uh there are connections to the wider story


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** and The Wider Girl.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Also, Leora Huxley is known as Leora Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Ah, yes, I forgot.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:12]** That was the most important part of my whole recap that I should have mentioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** It was the number two title or number one title.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** I don't know.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Maybe it is the title of this.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Maybe it's the title of this episode.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** It could be the title of this episode.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:24]** It probably shouldn't be for, you know, like... Spoilery reasons?

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** Yeah.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Parental advisory reasons, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** I mean, we can just put some alt characters in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** Listen,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** There it is.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** We have to make it somehow.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** Let's get into combat.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** We ended with this vest coming up.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** I'm going to bring you guys over to the map.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** Bada bing, bada boom.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Shibling fan.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:53]** We are looking at Leora Huxley on the ground prone in the center.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Standing above her is Migo7.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** Next to Migo is Kara Valtara.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** On the other side of Migo is this VESC IFF agent.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:05]** And then we have another VESC.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** IFF guard to the south.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:13]** We have Archie, who is chilling over in the corner, taking footage of everything.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** And then we have Cecil and Boom standing close to the entrance.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:21]** And up above on a little platform, there's a Yosuke IFF agent.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Taking away.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Taking away.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Yes.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:36]** This vest comes up, swings after shooting out this, like, two-handed pull arm with these kind of grappling pincers on the end to possibly grapple you or hit you.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Which one are they going to do?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:42]** Migo, I think I'm going to roll with this one.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** Let me make it a private self-roll.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** There it is.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:54]** They're going to come at you and with a 15, which I don't believe is going to hit against your case.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Good, sir.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Swings past you.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** Just you lean out of the way.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Feels like it might have been pretty close.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** So, yeah, you definitely move like it was going right for your head.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:13]** And then they are going to take a guarded step.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** Over.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Next move.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Let's go through here.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** It's going to be Boom.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** What are you doing?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Leora is on the ground.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:27]** Kara and Migo are starting to fight against Leora and this guard.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** You have one Yasuki up top, and you have one Vesk over on your left to the south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** What are you thinking?

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:39]** So Boom, he reaches into his cheek, and he goes...

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** And he pulls out, like, one of his many beautiful grenades.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** And it's another electric guy.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Electric guy, Dose.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:50]** And then he throws it at the Vesk.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Nice.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Yeah.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** And below.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** Like, just below Leor Huxley.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** So he does.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:06]** And then because he can do this all at once, he tells electric guy to he's like, wow, I was almost here for a second.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:11]** I was thinking it's like, let's make sure you do great.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** Electric slam.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Is the name of that attack again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Slam.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:21]** Also, you do need to roll to make sure that you hit where you're going to hit.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Yes.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** And not roll a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** It's important here because if you miss, it could go right over the edge.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** It could go ting, ting, ting and be gone.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** That is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** That is very true.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** So cool.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** So he needs to roll.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Yes.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Yes, he does.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** It's a central component of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** Yeah.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** At this table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:43 - 00:28:07]** there's a lot of infrastructure and rule set to support yeah the dodecahedron um it comes just like you throw it at something and then when it stops correct hold on where it stops no one knows the lab to work yeah yeah like for sure for sure yeah um that's good yes kev i see you what mine's not dodecahedron nobody


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** No, I care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** I love these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** I know you do.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** We know.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** We know.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** We know.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:20]** I know when I'm editing every ep and I hear... On top of everything you say.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Everything you say.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:29]** As you're throwing them on the desk, Steve's like...

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** Kelly, as Kelly gets closer to his screen, what is your role?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** Because, because, because... What?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Yeah, because what?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:44]** Because Kelly has been, like, he's been thinking that he really wants to, like, be good at rules now.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** So, after much consideration... Who is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** I don't know who I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** I feel like I had a split personality, like...

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:12]** thing happen and so now i'm trying to do this so yeah i'm trying to read the rules so that no one has to correct me that's what i'm trying to do we can also assist you kelly yeah dude it's cool just admit that you don't know we are your friends but i want to be thanks i like to roll a throw i just don't want to get mocked in the rules and mistakes channel anymore


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:19]** The shame that comes from the rules and mistakes channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** There's no one quite like the willing to tell you you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** You know, it's nice knowing when you're wrong, though.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** I like to be corrected.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** Just for the record, for anyone interested in listening.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:40]** It's an error in my thinking that I'm getting out of my head when I'm getting corrected.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:48]** Assuming that I remember in the future to follow the same rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Try and make mistakes once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** That's definitely what I'm trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** Hold on.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** I just assume I'm going to be wrong.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** Basically, I'm going to do an attack.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** This is a grenade.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** And then the grenade, it's a thing that you throw.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** I'm explaining this so that I know.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** It's a DC-5 if it's within the range.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** I know, I know.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** So it's a ranged attack.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** You have to meet DC-5.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** I'm saying this so that everyone knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** And then if it's further than that... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:48]** so well right if you do we have a neat tool for grenades well i all right hold on just let me i'll throw the grenade so like uh i i'm explaining this so that everyone knows that i'm thinking of the rules that's the only reason why i'm selling so i basically know that i have to like beat a five and i beat an eight with my like range attack so how what beats what corner are you aiming for


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** You target an intersection of squares.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** But it wouldn't matter at this rate, right?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Oh, yeah, it wouldn't matter based on the range.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** So he's going to do it right between Leora and the Vesk.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Right?

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Yeah.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** Okay, but which corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Pick the corners to choose from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:09]** The one towards Leora Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:09]** Okay.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Copy.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** So then I think you would have to beat a 10.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** So boom is going to move closer.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** What's the range increment for grenades?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Because I thought that was 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** It's 20 feet.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Minus two for every.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Yeah, plus two to the AC.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** It's plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** It's not double.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** So an eight would just get you there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Yep.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** So the more you know.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** You throw it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Good collab on the rules, y'all.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** You throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:40]** And this lightning elemental comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** I love it.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** I love that voice for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Hey, guys.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Are we going to the water park?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** I love water.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** I can go everywhere.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** Look at all those children in that pool.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Get out of the pool now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Get out of the pool.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:04]** So now, now speaking of rules, I'm just saying these things because I want to know.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** I want to know.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** So then like, because I'm turning over a new leaf right now.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** So then we have Nico7 on one side of Leora.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:16]** But it's not completely the opposite side from Electric Guy.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** Okay, I'm listening.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** So she's not flanked, right?

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** Because it's not directly across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** I'm going to have to look up flanked, but I think she might be.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** You have to be directly across.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** You have to draw a straight line from corner to corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:38]** Because he can draw a straight line from the top left corner to my bottom right.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:43]** But it doesn't go straight through the middle of the... I forget the exact verbiage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** The exact opposite side.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Yeah, I'm kind of prone.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Yeah.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** I mean, she's prone, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** She is prone.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:55]** So you're going to get a bonus to any melee attack that you do to her.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Yeah.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Okay, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** I like it.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:09]** He'll just do the attack that I'm going to remember right now, because he's an electric elemental, and that means that his electric attack is...

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:32]** uh please cut this part it's a little too it's it's good it's good no it's uh it's happening electric lightning elemental and my computer's so slow right now and that means that its attack is lightning strike that's what it is so he slams leora fucksley ah okay you're attacking leora


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** Yeah, yeah, for sure.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Okay.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Pops out, gonna attack Leora.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Love it, love it.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Okay.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** And what's your roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:52]** If Leora starts convulsing under this electricity, would she be Leora Buxley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** Kind of a stretch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** It's good.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** It's good.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** What's your attack roll, Kelly?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** I'm trying to roll it on the lab.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** The lab?

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Yeah.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** It's right now.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Do you want me to roll?

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** Why not?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Because it's not working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:36]** what's the modifier i really wanted this to go smoothly um it doesn't say uh yeah it just doesn't say this is why i suck at the rules uh yeah it does not say anywhere jolting surge as a spell like ability so let's just look up jolting surge that's what you're doing right no i'm doing lightning strike sorry lightning strike this is a level one right it's probably like plus four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:39]** I thought it was a little bit higher than a level one, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** What's the tier of the grenade?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Mark what?

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** I thought that it was a mark two, so it's level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Yeah, it's a mark two.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** It's got to be at least a level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:53]** Okay, so lightning strike, half electricity damage and half bludgeoning damage.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Yeah, it's interesting.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** I don't see anything here about damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:06]** This is what Adams talked about where they, like, you have a base character and then you graft onto them, and I've never looked into that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:28]** a summoning grenade right mark two yeah it's a mark two summoning grenade i'm looking at that lightning elemental stuff and i just don't see anything that talks about that it just says a lightning elemental slam deals half electricity damage and half bludgeoning damage yeah you must be going against some i mean there has to be a uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** It has to be some sort of either save or DC.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** Yeah, you're right.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Wow, this is really interesting.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** It's a template graph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Now we're in my territory.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** We could just make it up.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** Hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Hilarious.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Yeah, wow.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** There's just nothing on this.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** How did we get away with this last time?

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:56]** I think Elemental is a thing.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:01]** It's not even in a regular alien archive or anything.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:06]** It's on Starfinder 13 Firestarters page 57.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Summoning grenade, mark two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** It's the summon creature caster level six.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** So it's a six level spell.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** So you have to look up the spell.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Yeah, this is an annoying grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** A spell level and a caster.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** So yeah, wow, this is deep.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Oh my god.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Summon creature, star finder.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** We are really just exhausting this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** I just look up the attack then, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:33]** Somebody play the whole music for this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:37]** You summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the second level summoning list.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Where's the second level summoning list?

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** Oh, just to get an Electrovor.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:47]** So, yeah, there is no lightning elemental on the second level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** I read that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** It should just be elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** And then it does specifically say air, earth, fire or water.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** And there's small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** It doesn't say lightning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** There is one on fire starters.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Page 57.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** I thought I read that you could use any elemental.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:10]** There is such a thing as a lightning elemental, but it's not on the summoning list.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** And it's a small elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** How did he get a character sheet for it?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** I don't know, but we're finding it now.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** Okay, here is summon creature.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** So the grenade does summon creature.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** And this is the summon creature spell.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:30]** If you scroll down to the second level table, you can choose from anything on that.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:38]** Once you choose from that, you go to the elementals page, and there is a small elemental on this page.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:45]** And then that gives you your base skills and... Yeah, slam plus nine.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Right.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** And then you go to the graft, and that tells you flavor of each of those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** That's fine.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** I'm happy to have you keep a lightning.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** It's fine, because I think that's cool.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Yeah, just graft it as lightning.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Had it before.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** Let's just move through that, and now we know it's for this spell.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** It's all good.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** Difficult hunting down all of these... This is why.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Like, it's...

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** So much work to maintain all this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:14]** To be fair, people have complained about summoning in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:18]** They say that Starfinder is an easier version of 5e.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** No, no one says that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** No one says that.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:25]** No one says that.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Yeah.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Yeah, right.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** Okay, so your two hit is a plus nine.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Let's go back to the old system.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Your two hit is a plus nine.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** All right.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** I rolled a number for you, and then your damage is 1d6 plus five.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** So I rolled a six.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** So plus nine is a 15.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** That doesn't beat her AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Even with a minus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Yes.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** What?

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Erroneous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Erroneous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** But...

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:55]** We have identified that you do have a lightning elemental at level two with the stats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** I've identified that you're sus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Cool.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:04]** I tried this time, and I'll try again next time, and I'll know more about the rules of the thing that I'm going to do.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** Like I said, New Leaf in the progress of being turned over.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** So I appreciate your help this time.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Yeah, of course, dude.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Got you.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:33]** got you got you got you all right do you want to do anything else with your turn as far as a move action or anything else kelly do you want to do anything else with your turn i'm very curious of this answer since you're following the rules now well i mean i wasn't prepared for this well throwing the grenade was the standard action was the standard action which means where was the grenade when it's when you started it was what do you mean where was it when i started


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Where was the grenade when you started your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** In my hand.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** No, he took it out of his cheek.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** So he took... This is a movement action.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Ah, there it is.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Yeah.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** The answer is... No, because I can't do anything else with Twitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** Yes!

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Kelly's learning!

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** I love it!

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Alright!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** I love it.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Love it.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Love it.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Love it.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Love it.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Amazing.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** It only took $160.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Can we get an applause from the audience, please?

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** I love you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** Hooray.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** I love you.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Yay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Kelly did it.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Amazing.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Good stuff.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** All right.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** I like that.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:16]** It's like that meme of that guy who gets to the third or fourth place on that little tier thing.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Yeah.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** And you're like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:40]** that's you that's you it's one of my favorite memes cecil remy what are you doing with your turn yeah uh what is sorry before i go any further what is this thing right in the middle here uh that's just like a low barrier it's a low object maybe three okay so i can just like hop over that right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Or walk around it.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** It doesn't really matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** I think I have enough movement.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** If you want to try and walk around it, I'll say that it'll take an extra five feet if you want to climb up.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** How do I grab my character, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** You clip.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:53]** Yeah, I think you're on the boom mouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** I think you need to be on this one.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** There it is.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** So he's just going to move down.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** We're still on round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** I swear we've played this game before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** We have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** It's been a long time since I've played 5e.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** There's a lot of mice.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** You know, Mouse City.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:24]** So Cecil, he's going to walk down or kind of march over there over to Leora Huxley and stand right over her.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:32]** But before he does that, he's going to eye Archie and say, if this isn't some kind of setup...

**[00:41:32 - 00:42:01]** go do something about that other Yosuke as he's talking straight to Colonel Bolt and then he walks over to Leora and now he has Leora on the ground but since he has his pike out the Vesk behind well he's already flanking the Vesk yes sorry just to clarify the elemental is between Cecil and the Vesk

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:07]** But the elemental now has flanking on the Vesk.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** And anybody else who's attacking that Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Because you're within reach.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Cool.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Love it.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Love it.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** Cool.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Okay.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** So he's going to walk up and do that.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** And then he is going to... What?

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:20]** I have reach with my weapon, which gives me 10 feet of reach.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** And then I have the swarmer.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:29]** I believe it's a racial ability that anybody who is threatening the same creature as me doesn't matter where you're located.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Got it.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** You each get flanking bonus.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** That's a cool feat.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** That is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Not gonna lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:41]** Yeah, and coupled with a range or a reach weapon is awesome.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:45]** But anyways, he is then going to attack Leora Huxley.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Husky.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** Husky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** That's the Akatonian pronunciation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** She's on the ground, so she's Leora Duxley.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:59]** You'll pay for this, tomfoolery!

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:03]** It's a 10 on the die, plus 4.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** This is going to miss.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** So it's a plus 4, plus 4, plus 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** So it's 20 to hit.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:16]** 20 to hit, plus 4, plus 4, plus 2, because you're flanking.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** And it's a plus 4.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Why is it plus 4 twice again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Plus four for my attack bonus.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Plus two for my attack.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Then there's four because she's down on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** That's minus four, though, on her AC.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Yeah, it's minus four on my AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:36]** It's not, though, because if I had counted both, then maybe you would have hit.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** I'll take that back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** You don't hit.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** No.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** So it's a 16.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** You go to stab.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** It's right between her legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** How does she have more than 16 AC

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** On the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** You want to do anything else with your turn, Cecil?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** You moved.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** You attacked.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Do you want to do anything with a swift action?

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Nope.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** Okay.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** That's my turn.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** She does a lot of Pilates.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** She's really flexible.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** She's just into Pilates.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** She's really, really into Pilates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:07]** She's hitting the... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Pilates.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Maybe she does acrobatics.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** She could be Leora Tuxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** Keep trying, Betty.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Keep trying, Betty.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** One day you'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** It's pretty decent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** One day you'll get there.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:29]** It is the Vesk IFF agent who is in the south, the one who's in front of the super sweet lightning elemental.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:39]** They take a guarded step closer to Leora, Migo, and Cecil.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:46]** And they also shoot out this sweet double polearm.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Sorry, two-handed polearm.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** And they're going to, this time, attack Cecil.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:56]** And they are going to do a... Let's see.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** I think they're just going to attack you.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** They're just going to go right for it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Just go right for the jugular here.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:08]** That is a 10 against KAC, which I believe does not hit your KAC.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** It does not.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Yeah.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Definitely.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Definitely too low.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Sweeps over.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Both of them suck.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:22]** They are just like, I think a little in awe of all of your skills and the fact that things are just like moving quickly and you all are pros at this.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** You've done this many times.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:30]** You've heard speeches many times and you've come out successful and they're a little maybe intimidated, not mechanically, but they keep missing.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Sucks.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Sucks.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** That's round one.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** We're at the top of round two.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Hmm.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** We are at the top.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Man, this is going to be a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Going to be a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** I don't know if I like how giddy you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Is Leora ready to fight?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Is she Leora Nuxley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** I didn't think there would be this many things that would rhyme with it.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Hall of Fame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** I can name a couple.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Great.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** I can name a couple.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** Okay.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Will?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** Leora Puxley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** She's a hockey player?

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** She's a hockey player.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Leora Puxley?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Definitely the case.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:18]** You're running out of Leora Luxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** You're running out of Leora Luxley.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** That was in the hopper.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** I was waiting for that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:34]** That is what she says as

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:39]** She goes invisible, casting a spell.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** You all get attacks of opportunity on her.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:49]** And by you all, I mean Migo, Cecil, and Lightning Elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** She goes invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** Kara also has reach, doesn't she?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Kara has reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** She's got the lash out.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** She's got the lash out, everybody.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** She's got the lash out.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Okay.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** So let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** None of us hit because her AC is like way up there.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** She's on the ground though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Sweet.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Each of us gets attack of opportunities.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Each.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Well, and by each of you, I mean everybody, but boom.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Cool.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** And obviously not the Vesk IFF agents because they're not going to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Cecil's over here too, though.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Cecil can't do it, can he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** I got a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** You got a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** On the attack lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Did you add your 2?

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Everybody gets a plus 2 on this.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Why?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** My swarmer ability.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Oh, so 22.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Does Kara get a plus 2?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yes.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** If she is threatening the same person that I am threatening, we each get the bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Love it.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Cool.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:46]** Okay, so to be clear, Cecil, so Cara got a 22.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Kev, you got a... 12.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Okay, you got a 12.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Migo?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** 15.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** 15.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Lightning Elemental.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** 48.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Easy.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Ridiculous number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:03]** I'm trying to look up the... You're going to be like, oh, miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Her AC is 30.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** Okay.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** I'm trying to look up the lightning strike attack.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** It's a plus nine.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** It's a plus nine.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** It's in the link.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** It's in the link.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** You roll the crit?

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** No, no, no.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** It's a d20 plus nine.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** I didn't know you sent a link.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Which one of these three links is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** It's the bottom one, I believe.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** That's the template graph.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** And then you want to look for a small elemental.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** And you'll see a melee attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** No, it'll be the middle one.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** The middle one's the elemental.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** The graph is the lightning.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** So, Star Gem or SRD.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** I'm rolling on Hero Lab, which is really slow right now.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** And here we go.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Let's see how it goes.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** All right.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** That's a...

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Ooh, a plus what again?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Nine, you said?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Plus nine.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Yep.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Excellent.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** All right.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** So that's a 23.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** 23.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** That's badass.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Okay.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** They all miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** They all miss.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Every last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:08]** Cecil and Migo, you both swing and it just it it hits and you feel like you didn't you didn't get anything right.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:18]** It just totally like goes through and hits the ground and is not at all able to be, you know, go through.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** Sorry, I'm clicking and thinking at the same time.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:28]** Kara and Lightning, I need both of you to roll damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** They don't get a concealment because she's invisible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** I was thinking about that.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** It feels like one of the things that Starfinder says is that there's no way to clandestinely cast a spell.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** So you see her casting the spell and starting to go invisible.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:48]** So it makes sense to me that I'm not going to rule that she would be invisible just by the properties of the spell to incur a penalty on that.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:52]** Is the spell... Is she casting invisibility?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** You need to roll a missus and check to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Yeah.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Okay.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** So Kara hit her with a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Two.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Two points of damage.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Love it.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** And what about lightning elemental?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** It's a 1d6 plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** Lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Yeah.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:07]** The link that was in the chat doesn't work for some reason.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** I don't know why.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** What's the attack?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** 1d6 plus five.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** 1d6 plus five.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** Okay.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Oh, dang.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** I will... What you get.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** What you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** That's a good stat.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** Yeah.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Yeah, that is a good stat.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** That is a real good stat.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Where's Kelly going?

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** He's running.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** He's running somewhere to get his die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** He's getting his calculator.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** He's getting the real die.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** He's getting the real die.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** He remembered he was playing Starfinder.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Eight damage.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Love it.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Wow.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** You guys have dealt 22 points of damage to her.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** That is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Hey, take this.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** As she's going invisible, you hit her with attack, Ashkara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Not so fast!

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** Cuts across her arm, dealing two points of damage.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** The lightning slam.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** She is Leora Buxley as her legs kind of twitch.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:15]** She continues to go invisible, and right as she does, you see that the signs of a teleport.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** As she has teleported.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** She has so many attacks.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** I mean, here's with blush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:30]** She used some kind of special ability to go invisible and then she used the spell teleport or something along those lines.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:33]** Did the spell get stopped by the attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** I can go into this after we finish this whole adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** As long as you're aware.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** I have done my work.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** I appreciate you calling on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** I have made this character foolproof.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:47]** You cannot defeat her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** Okay.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** That is her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** She's still in initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** She's still in initiative order.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** She's still around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Metagame, she's still around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:04]** We can walk through how, if you want to try and perceive where she is at that time.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Who's next?

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** What's going on?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Is the fight over?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** That's it!

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** She's gone!

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** That's the end of the fight.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** That's the end of the game.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Looks like your boss took a leave of absence.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** Leora ducks because she's ducking out.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** That's good.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** That's good.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:27]** Are we all doing it better than Benny's doing it?

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** What?

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Did I say that out loud?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** I don't like that at all.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** I think that's Leora.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** Yeah, that's a good one.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Am I trying to incense you against her?

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Maybe like you, the player.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** All right.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** A couple things are going to happen.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** A couple things are going to happen.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Wait, is this the impetus of the battle?

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** Is this Leora Cruxley?

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Oh, that's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:50 - 00:53:11]** that is good that's pretty good that's pretty good she's gonna land in some mud and be leora muxley okay and then you'll be able to see her first things first you hear uh this this sound from the gate there's a spinning component

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** At the top, as you see, lights start to become orange.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:32]** And then each one, one by one, becomes green, clearly indicating, without any sort of engineering check, that whatever has happened, the...

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:49]** gate has locked on to something some sort of whatever target it is locked in and i will reveal as the gate comes online on the map as this white light starts to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:49 - 00:54:10]** fill the entire aperture of the gate and you see these like shards of like drift and and white starting to move into the gate and sure enough on the map that the gate is now white it was empty before it was just a circle and now it's filled in with white and looks like glass shards but you said it was targeting somebody


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:19]** You can tell pretty quickly that the gate needs a brief moment to dial up and target whatever it's targeting.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** You probably need to get closer to the gate.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:28]** console to see exactly what's going on, but it did lock in somewhere.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** It did lock in somewhere.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:41]** Now, as a result, when that happens, all of you feel this strange sensation in your body, like the four of you want to be pulled

**[00:54:41 - 00:55:11]** towards the gate as this sense of urging and i've put it on the map as this like pulse coming towards you that you all are feeling this urge like like your muscles want to move and maybe your brain does too there's something in your brain that's like yeah i want to go in there yeah like the nanobots and then like a moth to the flame and then the air behind cecil begins to shimmer there's a

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:35]** like heat in the desert then flecks of color start to leave streaks through the air eagerly followed by cara you can see this vertical line of color running along the right angle of the railing and the floor as smoke begins to erupt from this corner

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:53]** over here, that little thing that Kevin asked about, that little console that's three feet high, right at the bottom where the straight line meets the floor, smoke begins to come out until you can start to see the silhouette of this smoky, demonic looking canine.

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:02]** And you see the white outlines of black eyes appear as this hound seems to step out of the smoke silently.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Part of it

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:28]** somehow is in this world some of it is not and there's a voice that fills cecil's mind as i show you here on the map and the voice says your misstep will lead to your death and that's our game this fucking metal the dog said this
