**[00:01:33 - 00:01:38]** I guess our agents are efficient.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** I thought you meant us.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** You are very efficient and talented.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** How?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** In what way are we efficient?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Well, we are a little late recording.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** But, you know, that was fine.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** We all were doing things.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** You're very efficient and talented role players, cast members.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** Killing it.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Not all your new characters.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** But, we appreciate it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** We are talented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** I would not qualify as efficient.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** You're an efficient role player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** No one's described this as efficient in my own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:16]** I do like that you used shocking because we left off with Migo being shocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** Thank you for picking up on my brick rooms.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It's good.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** Here's my question of the week.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Very simple.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Could be a long conversation.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Could be very short.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Who knows?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** It's a good song.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Which starter Pokemon would you choose?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** We're limiting it to red, blue, or yellow.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** Red, blue, or yellow.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** You're talking about just the three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** No, like the original Pokemon games.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** Red version, blue version, or yellow version.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** You have four options, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** Yeah, look, I don't remember what the ones were for... What were they?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Silver and gold?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Were those the next two?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:56]** So, like, you could also choose those, but if you know it, I'm not going to penalize you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** There's only 151 Pokemon.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I think we've had this discussion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** We have.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:05]** The church split was when they had more than 151.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Kevin's like, I use Hotmail.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** This is too new and fandangled for me.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** I'm sticking to the original 150.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:17]** I had a Game Boy Color and it was the infrared on the top.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** And we tried to... I had one friend that would link his game with me.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** I had red and he had... Or I had...

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Yeah, I had red and he had blue, I think.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** And we would try to link the game in order to trade the Pokemon you couldn't get on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** I don't think it worked very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** That link never worked for anyone ever.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:37]** I don't know why that was touted as such a feature.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** And it was never used for any other game that I know.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** And it was like, hey, do you have a link cable?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** No, do you have a link?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** No one had a link cable.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** No.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** If you had a link cable, you were the have among the have-nots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:52]** Dude, books a million, Sundays...

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:59]** That was when you could bust out your Pokemon cards and game.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** And you could do the trades that they always encourage you to do.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** And I think that was how I got Alakazam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yep.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Because that was the only way you could evolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** That's the only way.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** We definitely need to talk about our favorite Pokemon after we talk about our starters.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That's next episode.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** What?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I have to wait all that time?

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I never had one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** We're trying to be efficient, you know?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** That's not efficient.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Wait, Will.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** I never had a Pokemon game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** No!

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** F in the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Wow.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Well, just if you were, though, what would you do?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Because, I mean, you could just pretend you're Ash from, like, the show, right?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Satoshi.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Just, like, choose your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Will's from a time period where they would catch dragons.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** That's true.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Yeah.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** He would ride a dragon.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Yeah, he would.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** What was your starter dinosaur, Will?


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:50 - 00:05:17]** we've talked about this he likes the flying ones yeah yeah yeah which i think is a pokemon but it's not like uh i mean you could go protozoic and be like what's your what's your starter bacteria right single cell organism what's your starter single cell organism you know uh cool well i'll go first which never happens dude pikachu all the way come on easy easy yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:42]** i didn't have yellow so i can't say yeah well you know yellow yellow didn't come out until i was already done with the first game so he was like that's enough for me i think yeah so i had red and i think that's the only like that's that's one of very few if not the only game that i got that was like while it was current generation i was almost always as a kid a generation behind for like consoles video games and stuff yeah

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:48]** And as soon as I got read, Bulbasaur just resonated with me.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** He spoke to me.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** God, fuck you, Vinny.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:56]** The grass types have always... They're my people.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** I don't know why Kelly is so aggressive right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:03]** Because we always choose the same shit.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Because it's fucking Allosaurus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** Allosaurus Bulbasaur.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** That's it.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** I was a Charmander person.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I had red, I'm pretty sure.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** I can't remember exactly, but I had red.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** I'm going to state that on the record.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** And I picked Charmander almost every time.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Wow.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:27]** Looking back, though, I think Bulbasaur actually had some abilities that would have been useful.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Bulbasaur was a good starter.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** He was, yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:36]** So I went back and did some reading about the different starters, like why you had those three options.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** And apparently they were effectively the difficulty of the game.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:47]** So, like, the grass type was easy because the grass was powerful against the first two gems.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** And so really all you had to trade was that one Pokemon.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:57]** Water was medium because it was really strong against Brock and his rock types, but was the same as Misty's Cerulean.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:03]** And Charmander was hard mode because he wasn't strong against anything.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** You had to train your Pokemon up really well and really evenly in order to...

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Build out your team.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Yeah.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** So I just inadvertently chose easy mode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:18]** I also inadvertently chose easy mode, but I think it's because Bulbasaur is just a... I knew that he turned into Venusaur.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** Venusaur is just this beefy fucking dude.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** And he just looked epic to me.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** That's why.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** And he just looked cool.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** So that's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:32]** Squirtle sucked, but Blastoise or Blastoise, whatever his name is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, it was Blastoise.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** Blastoise, the third evolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:35]** Yeah.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** He's boss.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** He looks like a... Shoulder cannons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:46]** Reminds me of, I can't remember the name of that train, but there's a train from Thomas the Train that has two water cannons.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** It's the firefighting train.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** I have children.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** I have children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** That's a UN statement.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:57]** The question is, which starter Pokemon do we think Will would choose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** What are the first starter Pokemon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Okay.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** So there's Pikachu, electric type.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** There's Bulbasaur, grass type.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** There's Squirtle, water type.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Or there's Charmander, fire type.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** It's only those...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:36]** three yeah for the first like four couple games yeah there's only three and then the yellow version came out just like a year later and that was a special you could get pikachu out of out of the four and if you got yellow and didn't get pikachu we're silly did does yellow also have like all 150 or was that yeah i would probably go yellow

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Because the other ones only had 140?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** No, they had way less than that.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** They only had like 80 or 90 each.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:46]** You had to have red and blue and trade back and forth in order to get all 150.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** I never tried to get 150.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** I'm not a true Pokemon.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** I didn't either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I just found the ones that I wanted.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** I don't even know how to play the game.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** That's how terrible I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** Dude, there are some good Pokemons out there, Will, if you want to play.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** There are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** There's some really good emulations, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:04]** Also, can I say that I was never mad about Raichu.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:07]** I would also choose Raichu a lot over Pikachu.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Who's Eevee?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Raichu is cool.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Dude, Eevee is one of my faves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** He was a boss, yeah.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:19]** He was the first Pokemon that could then be evolved into different species.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Yeah, it could be Flareon.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** Flareon, Jolteon, Vaporeon.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** So fire, electric, and water.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** And then... Scion?

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Was it Scion?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:35]** Well, in later versions, you got Umbreon, Espeon.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Yeah.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** Which were, I think, psychic and dark types.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** Yeah, I saw a Cosmo or whatever.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** Like some cloud Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** I mean, there are so many now that could possibly be it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:52]** John, did you say that you didn't like Raichu because people don't like Raichu?

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:56]** They don't like the fact that Pikachu turns into Raichu because he's not cute or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Yeah, I get it.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** Pikachu is so iconic, but I liked Raichu.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Raichu was cool.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Raichu was just a badass.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:10]** I don't remember the abilities, so I don't remember technically what made Raichu better than Pikachu, but I liked having both.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** So I would double up, but it was worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Raichu was just like the next evolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:29]** There's this game, if y'all want to play, the only real sort of Pokemon MMO, because there isn't a Pokemon MMO officially yet, but the closest thing is something called Pow World.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Pow World, yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** You should check it out.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** It's basically Pokemon, but more violent.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** You can even capture other trainers, apparently, which is really weird.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** That's wild.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** I definitely want to play.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** I didn't bring a gaming PC with me, but that was my huge mistake.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** Next time, I'm definitely going to buy one and bring one because... You're just going to steam deck.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:56]** It's super coincidental, but Grayson just got some socks given to him.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** We just had a whole bag of socks given to us because kids grow fast.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:05]** And one set of socks in there, Lauren shouted from downstairs, like...

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:27]** uh maybe your daddy can answer this one and i had to go down and be like oh yeah that's pikachu on a it was a pokeball the sock had a pokeball like right on the ankle nice and it was a shadow of pikachu over it and i was like yeah it's pikachu from pokemon because why are you guys slacking what's up yeah why don't you know this like grayson has an excuse he's only three years old kids


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** That's no excuse.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** At three years old, you need to be world ready.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:39]** Speaking of hanging out in Pokemon, you know, I think there's a good chance that when we hit Gen Con, we might have a hookup, y'all.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:44]** Because as we found out, our friend Finder has one of the link cables.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:51]** And we know that because Finder is here with us as an audience watching.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Good to have you here, Finder.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Appreciate you.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** You rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** What's up, Finder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:03]** If there's a moment where you're like, wow, that was super wrong, then, you know, just feel free to message us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** He is one of our paralegals.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** He's probably the lead paralegal.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** And he's allowed to call us out.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** The lead illegal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** The legal legal?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** The lead illegal.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Yeah, the lead illegal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:17]** Also, we're announcing, like, we're going to Gen Con.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** It's official.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** We are going to Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Presuming we get our tickets.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** This episode airs after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:30]** Assuming we maintain our current level of efficiency.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** We're just going to cut this whole section if we didn't get them.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** We're not going to Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Please don't.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:49]** Some more information to come about meetups or some detailed information about a chance to hang out, and hopefully we will see you there on the floor.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** With that, I think we get into it.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:56]** Get back into that infill, extraction, hostage mode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Let's do it.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** Finder, if we suck today, it'd be nice to be nice to us.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Oh, wow.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:10]** He wasn't nice to us when we did the spaceship combat.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Really?

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** What are you talking about?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:23]** He said things like, you know, if you guys would be the best at this, I really would think that if literally no one else was alive.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** He would say things like that.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** It's like spaceship combat.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** I had seen him burn us so hard, and I was very happy to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** That's good brains.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Thank you.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** He can't gloss over that.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:48]** All right, y'all are pushing further and further into the Ringworks Morrow headquarters, the new headquarters.

**[00:13:49 - 00:14:00]** First, surveying the scene of the crime and then eliminating the vests that were waiting in the conference room to take out the IFF agents.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:04]** And then you walk out in this nice, fancy lobby.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** And you're like, what's that under the desk?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:12]** Cokes and agent come out from where they're hiding.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** And they pull the gun on you.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** They start attacking.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Boom continues.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:26]** His path of destruction, his vengeance, his vendetta against desks and other office furniture blows up a desk.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** And then you hear something behind the door.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Migo goes over.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** It's like, huh.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Hear something over there.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Me.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Me just tap the door and zap.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Get hit with the trap.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** So glad.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** Shocking.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** I got you with that.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Shocking.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:48]** with a security trap as you get hit with a lightning bolt.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:59]** And the door opens, and I believe it was at that time, I'm going to bring you guys over to the map, that there was a gun pointed at Migo taking a shot.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Brought you guys over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:11]** The CEO's personal living quarters is in the building, the Ringworks building.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** If you recall.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Somehow I missed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:14]** Yeah.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:19]** So I told you guys that at the brief when you're in the copter on your way over.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:24]** And then that was also some information that you got from Archie as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:27]** This is not like cognitive dissonance, not making that connection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** What kind of CEO lives at work?

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** No, it's not a live at work.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** It's that the residence has an attachment to the office.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** So that way, while they are there, they can quickly move in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Sounds like a pineapple pin.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** A pineapple pin?

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** What?

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:46]** So the residence and the office building, and you put them together, it's a residence office building.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** They live at work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Yeah, it's a pineapple pin.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** I got you.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** If you guys haven't seen that, we'll post it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** I don't know what that is.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:57]** You're like two years too late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** Cool.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Cool.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Cool.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Cool.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I'm going to just add two things together and say it next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:05]** Leora Huxley's residence where they reside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Current residence.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Yes.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** While the office is being worked on, they've been staying there.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** So it's near it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:16]** I presume that they have... While their office was being worked on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:23]** While the new office is being finished and worked on, she was right next door.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:28]** There are other places that she has, but it's of no concern at this time.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Maybe I'm just missing it.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** I don't know.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** She lives at work, so I'm here.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Office building?

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** No matter how you explain it, she lives at work.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** There's like a mansion-y place next to it.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** And there's a hallway where they can go between.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** So office.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:49]** Yeah, I imagine it's sort of like how the governor's mansion is right next to the Capitol building.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** It's the White House is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** That might be a little bit more.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** It's like the East Wing and the West Wing.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Sure.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** That's a great way to put it.

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** Yeah, that's a great way to put it.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Buildings are a little more separate.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:06]** Do you feel like your apple has been kerfuffled, Kev?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Am I doing it right?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:13]** Is that the pineapple pen trend where you just say a fruit and another noun and then you just go forward with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** I don't really know.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** I can't really explain what pineapple pin is to someone who doesn't know what pineapple pin is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** That's fine.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** Let's get back into combat.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:29]** So, Miko, there is a gun firing at you, and that is going to be a, I believe that is a, let me double check my numbers here.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:35]** Yeah, 27 to hit against your casing.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** 27.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Yeah.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Alright.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:45]** Okay, you get five points of electricity damage.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:53]** Again, more electricity damage in your face as this gun fires at you.

**[00:17:53 - 00:18:04]** And then as it fires, you can see a bit of this Yosuke who is standing there and their head peeks around the corner and

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:10]** When it does, there's this voice coming from inside the room.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** You can see a bit.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** This looks like a technical room.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:25]** And this face peeks around with these goggles, sees you, and then just shouts out, just says, Hey, Waxie!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** What?

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I just shot the hammer!

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Is that Caravalchuk?

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Oh, f*** it.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** That's Caravalchuk.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Oh, f***.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Okay.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:40]** And that is their turn, as they might have possibly recognized some of y'all.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** What are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** What are you doing?

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Cecil.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Man, you got me all distracted.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** I'm trying to figure out what the hell's going on.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** Okay, let me see.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Here's Migo.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Stalling for time.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Stalling for time.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** The one down here is dead, right?

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** Yosuke's behind cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:07]** Took damage from the explosion of the desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Dusty death.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:12]** I was just thinking about diagonals today, and I forget exactly how it works.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** So I'm just going to move to there.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** Okay.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:24]** I'm going to move myself my 30 feet, and as I do that, I'm going to trace my pulse caster rifle around.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** I'm going to shoot this one here in the doorway.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** That was in the room.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** And that's the one that said they recognize us?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** Yeah.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** All right.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Fire away.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** For a second, your name was over it, so it looked like it was named Kevin.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** I was like, I don't remember naming that one Kevin.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** But maybe it was named Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Aw.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** What'd you get?

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** 14 to hit.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Against?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** I think that's EAC.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Yeah, it's a hit.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Yes.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** From the long arm.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:05]** So that's D6 plus six.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** It's plus four.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Gross.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:10]** And then plus an additional two because a pulse caster rifle is already a non-lethal weapon.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:14]** And using Merciful Striker, it adds a plus two to it.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:19]** Which I believe Merciful Striker comes from Starfinder Enhanced.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:44]** maybe we will find out keep going no i want to look it up now i'm really excited to use this anyways um so yeah it's gonna be a d6 plus six yes it's from starfinder hints yes okay well that was a one on the die so it's total of seven points of non-lethal damage though seven points of non-lethal damage okay he says recognize this and he's like i don't know who you are why'd you say that

**[00:20:44 - 00:21:06]** i don't know the other guys sorry dude i yell at other fans people all right uh cool so seven points of damage fires across hits them pretty brutal looks like it did a lot of damage for their frame good stuff good move y'all are moving tactically like you do cara valtara leader of the stars team what you gonna do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** Does Kara recognize the voice that cried out and recognized her?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Or is it just... No.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** No, they're just fans.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:20]** You think that they, you know, the two of you are not new on the street.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** You know, maybe some word has gotten around about who you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Does anybody know who Miss?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** Kara is undoubtedly famous, but don't know.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** Are we pausing the combat to have a conversation about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:41]** Kara steps over next to Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** I don't recognize you, sir.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:49]** And she fires her light asphalt rifle.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Lethally?

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Non-lethally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** Oh, okay.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** I mean, it's not a non.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** I can switch to the compliance array, I suppose.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Sure, as you moved, yeah.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** Uh, but then I lose my move and I can't shoot anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** You could, you could drop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** I could drop it.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** I'll drop it.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:13]** I'll drop the fast fall rifle just for the moment.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Okay.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:23]** And pick up, pull out the, uh, combat reload, you know, toss my weapon like John Wick and flash compliance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Right.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** Yeah.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:29]** Four and 19 on the die for 24 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** Right between the eyes, man.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** Fine, we'll do it non-lethally.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** That's the good behind it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Four points of damage.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:43]** Four points of damage, and they fall over unconscious.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Knocked them out.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Well done.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** They are out.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** You have one combatant left.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** I like this tag team from Cecil and Kara.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Migo, it's your turn.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** There's only the Yosuke IFF agent at the ruined desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:10]** You see Migo's a bit crestfallen because he definitely wanted to hammer the point home, not to shoot him in the face.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Sign an autograph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** I guess he will...

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** You know, he's going to run and like Dukes of Hazzard slide across the splinters of this desk.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Yeah.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** And say.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** It's hammer time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** You're the nail I've been looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** The stars will take a life.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Cool.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** For some reason, I pictured Migo with a hammer from Smash Brothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:50]** That's only a 10 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** You misjudge it and you just slam on more of the desk, fulfilling Boom's wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Yeah.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:03]** He finds the side chest of drawers that wasn't completely destroyed by the grenade.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Gone.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Smashes it.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** That's it.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** That's his turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Okay.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Alrighty.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** Top of round two.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** It is that Yosuke's turn.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** What do they do?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:28]** What do you do when you hear your partner taken out by Kara Baltara and then Migo, just the hammer comes and tries to hammer you.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** That's a tough one.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Good thing they are committed to the cause.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:46]** And this Yosuke drops the ARC pistol and tries to hit you with a tactical baton in your knee, specifically.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** And that is a 15 against KAC, Migo.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Nothing.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Nothing.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** That doesn't do it.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:56]** I picture that just musters all the courage possible.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Pulls out the baton, hits you on the knee.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Ding!

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Ding!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:23]** like as hard as they could because nothing it does nothing to you amazing amazing boom it's your turn what are you gonna do no you rolled bad whatever it was yeah but wait what what you rolled bad right i i heard i heard the dice roll in my ear and then i look up and kelly's like oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:46]** no it's just because the yosokis with batons bring is just that ptsd is thaddeus because that was like the first engagement where they're like three yosokis like that surprisingly deadly with batons everyone and it's ironic that a cat got taken out of which by my i don't want to talk about it yeah it's the worst it was such a sad day um

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:49]** Well, boom had a grenade equipped and Kelly's trying to be good with the rules.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** So that means that he has to equip his gun again.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** So that takes up my movement.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:59]** So, um, you know, now I think it's only a swift action to, to do change grips.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Cool.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** So boom can now move and shoot.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:10]** And then like, you know, as he's like moving across, like over here to behind the desk, basically to get in line of sight of this.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** Yeah.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:35]** yeah okay like he he keeps hearing things like you know like non-lethal non-lethal but as he's doing that he just like puts on his headphones he's just like terrorists and fanaticals and then he lethally fires his uh squad machine gun what is

**[00:26:36 - 00:27:01]** not that one this is his angry song all right so here we go will is right you have a clear line of sight the desk is mostly destroyed there's no cover uh okay cool one moment please um ranged i have so many like things now okay cool

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Here we go.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Just wait.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:06]** It didn't make it, I think.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** It was just like a seven to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** That, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Yeah.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** Maybe you were bobbing your head in B too much.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Moved your rifle.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** It just didn't.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Just missed.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Yeah.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Just rolling low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Rough.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** It's all right.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Very rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:23]** All right.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:32]** So as Boom puts down the cover fire, it's not actually a cover fire, Cecil is going to step up.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:44]** And as he's walking forward, he is going to, like, he's got his pulse caster gun up, and he almost just, like, lifts it up, and it fades into his arm as he reaches for his pike.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Nice.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** And then he just pokes this guy in the face.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** I'm going to pull up my...

**[00:27:51 - 00:28:13]** yeah i'm rude my with my non-lethal pike that that non-lethal tip face jab 15 on the die you and hold on it's 15 plus 4 19 19 to hit you hit their face yes successful jab successful

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:17]** That's an eight on the die with a plus seven for a total of 15.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Is that right?

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:20]** I'm terrible at math.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:24]** So 15 points of non-lethal damage straight to the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** Their eyes are locked with Migo after having tried to hit their leg.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:34]** And then they look up and then just, boom, hit in the temple, pass out Migo.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Yay.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** You all wait for just a minute to make sure that everything is good.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** All right.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Are we out of initiative?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** You are out of initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Cecil is going to step up and clear the room.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** He's just going to step over the body as he steps into the room and then shout, clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** There's doors to northeast, I will check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Okay, so...

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** Cecil, you walk in.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:01]** You see clearly that this is a 20 by 30, 40 room.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** There's a desk with three chairs.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Seems like an office.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** There's a computer monitor station with three screens.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** A lot of technical.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** They didn't try to make this space pretty.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** It's a technical space.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Lots of storage, desks.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** This seems like it's probably a security office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** There's no one else in there.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:46]** yeah that was first off is like do i need to do a perception check to make sure there's nobody else in the room um if not then he's he's gonna call it clear um and then he's gonna cuff the put binders on the yusoki okay because they're unconscious and then um i don't think i have computers boom boom you're the computer guy right boom can't hear you can you speak up a

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** He's all the way over there.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** I got computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** He's very good at computers if you need help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** Cecil steps over to the computer.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** I've seen a computer before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** There's a computer in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:14]** And I guess I will do... When you walked up to that room, you seemed... The room had a label that said data in that northeast room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Got you.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Cecil, I'm here to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** That's a 15 total computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Give me one sec to help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:28]** And Migo and Kara, you are waiting in the hallway, keeping... What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:45]** Kara is going to be looking at these other... She suspects you can go in the hallway, but this is the hallway to the north, the northernmost spot on the map in this room.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** is the hallway.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:50]** And you had said, I think like something about three door, three sections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:51 - 00:31:00]** There were three major exit points from this, this kind of layout area, this like C suite area.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:14]** And one of those is the residential access where there was confirmed activity, some sort of something happening in one of those to the resident in, in the residential area.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** One of these three.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:22]** Now, I'll say that when you first came in the door to the door that's down south here, that's right.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** That looks like a big, major entry.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:31]** And you would think, all right, this is an entry like this is somebody's first experience coming in here.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Right.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:35]** So that's probably one of the entry points.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Now, there are two doors.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** You're standing in the middle of the lobby, pretty much.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** There's a door immediately to your west.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Unclear what that is.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** There's a door to your southwest.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:50]** That's very clearly labeled as restrooms.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** This one here?

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:55]** Yes, the door to your southwest is labeled as restrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** Well, Migo is putting binders on the Suzuki.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Okay.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:07]** He's putting them on uncomfortably tight, though, because he took that personally.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I can't blame you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:13]** Are there any conductive surfaces in this lobby?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** Yeah.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** If you wanted to try and sense something, then I would say the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:39]** floor is probably wood but there are some conductive surfaces that you could reach out and touch maybe a sconce it's very tastefully designed i know i keep saying that but it really is yeah yeah i think um car would be doing that while uh crews binding up and searching i guess the bodies


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** Okay.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Let me know.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:49]** Look into the electrolocution while I jump over and boom, see soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Alien Archive 4.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Feel the presence of other creatures through conductive surfaces.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:58]** Sensors installed in your hands or feet can do the same.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:04]** You make contact with the metal crystalline or metallic surface.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:10]** You can detect the presence of other creatures within 60 feet that are also in contact with the same surface.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** Within 60 feet in contact with the same surface?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** Even through walls and other obstacles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Sorry, I didn't catch it.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** This is a racial feat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** No, this is a nanosite augmentation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Radical.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Okay.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** That's cool.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** That's real cool.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** I think that...

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** Well, let's go to Cecil and Boom real quick.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** So you are doing what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** So Cecil rolled, what was it again?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** For computers?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Perception or computers?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** He was rolling computers, I believe.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** I rolled computers with a 15.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:46]** So Boom, unfortunately, even with all his bonus, he has a nice bonus, but he rolled a one.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** So you know what I'm saying?

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** I think it's a crit fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** My total is 11.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** You can't crit fail.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** You automatically pass for 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Yeah, for 8 it's 10+.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** That's the 17.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:00]** It seems like you're close, but something's just not right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** You're not seeing what there is in the computer.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** You can't quite get in.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** So 17 is not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Not quite on it today, I'm afraid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:18]** I don't know that you could take 10, but I would say there's probably a limit on how many times you could try in doing this, knowing that you're trying to get through, obviously, to get to Leora.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:25]** So I don't know that you could take 10 unless you really wanted to jump in, but I would say that you probably have maybe two more chances.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** And that's my guess.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:35]** I would probably leave that up to Kara and other leaders as far as your pacing and how many times people want to go through.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** I'm going to say it takes probably a minute or two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** If you want to give it a go, go for it.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** And Cecil is going to step out of the room so he doesn't get electrocuted when you fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:56]** Thanks for our support.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:19]** i mean how are you getting in since this is uh all right so god i'd like to take another 10 minutes uh to try to really get through this we don't really have 10 minutes i think you could you probably roll hide up you said you have a plus nine or plus 10 on your skill check yeah but i'd just be rolling forever then don't i need to take 10 in order to justify doing this again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** No, I rolled fairly low.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** I rolled a nine plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** Yeah, but I rolled to assist you.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** Could I just independently roll again?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Yeah.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:36]** Now that Cecil's out of the room, less distracted.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Crack some knuckles.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Crack knuckles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** Put headphones on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:44 - 00:36:11]** just bobbed his head as a cigar like bouncing uh it's uh it's just a 12 though it's only one point better without cecil you okay yeah that's yeah it's not i think that that's probably taking up another two or three minutes um you could probably have a five minute total if you had one more chance and then at that point i'll leave it up to cara i'm thinking every check is about one to two minutes so three checks is around five minutes

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I'm saying I don't know how much time you guys want to spend doing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** So you're giving me another shot here is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:23]** I'm saying there's one more chance for you to jump in where my guess of how much time Kara is allowing to spend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** I'll tell you.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Well, he doesn't consult Kara.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** I'm sorry, Kara.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:32]** But like he's just going to like really quickly because he knows what he's doing.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Kara and him go way back.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** He knows what's allowed and what sort of flexibility.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** Yeah, it's boom.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** We're on a schedule.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Boom knows.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:43]** You know what they said.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** We don't set the timeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:50]** Before you roll them, Kara, which direction are you looking?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:55]** Is it a 60-foot diameter?

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Is it a circle?

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Is it like a line?

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** Or is it just anything within 60 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** So I guess it would be a circle 60 feet around me.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Cool.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Love it.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Love it.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Love it.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Okay.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Okay.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Cool.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Cool.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Cool.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:14]** Uh, I think that would be, I didn't mean to draw this square on you.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Okay.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** That's super helpful, but I don't know how to move it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** It's okay.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:27]** I think you sense that there is movement at the edge of your, uh, the edge of your periphery.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Off to the west?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** To the west.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:34]** Yeah, and there's a pretty strong sense of movement in this area.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Let me draw it on the map.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** In this general area, do you see this white thing that I drew?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** No, not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Is he supposed to see it only?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** No, I was just putting it in the area.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** Let me maybe outline the corners of it in kind of this area.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Let me go back here.

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:00]** In your southwest area, it seems like in an area possibly within the bathrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** Guys, I sense there's a movement in this bathroom here.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** And I don't mean... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Yeah.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Boom.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** What do you do with that knowledge, Boom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** Boom just tries to erase every distraction.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Every, like, Cecil squeak gone.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Everything.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Like, nothing in his head.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** And he rolls a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Rolls a 26.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** Your concentration pays off.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:53]** opens up you see three things with the game see three things you see a you see one that that there's a very clear indicator on the screen that the office this whole area is in a sort of lockdown emergency state okay you see that there are traps still within the uh space

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:57]** You do see that there are cameras that you can plug into.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:06]** You will need to roll another computer check to both see and disable where those traps are or to see into the cameras.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** He's going to do that right now.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** You do see that there is a window open that whoever was here last was reading.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** There's a memo that's been kind of stuck up.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** maybe a little posterized, kind of pinned onto the screen.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:29]** It's a memo from Leora Huxley herself to the security individual saying, thank you for the system upgrades.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** Your security work is invaluable and your work ethic even more so.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** We all work better when tomorrow is safe.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** What you give, you get back.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Signed, Leora Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:46]** All right, boom, rolls a 26 again.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** He's going to try to shut down those security things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** The traps or the cameras?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** You trying to look at the cameras or you trying to look at the traps?

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Traps, traps, traps.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** You see that there were two more traps.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:06]** They were both in, you can see now with this open that you can see a rough plate there.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:36]** of room programming and what else is in here so immediately to your the the the wall on the western side of the lobby the bathroom right you see that on the other side of the bathroom there is another storage ish area smaller you see that the uh the the western single panel door that seems to be some sort of a waiting area um and there were two traps in there that are now off

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:43]** One of them was a laser trap that was able to shoot anybody moving in.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:54]** And another one is a pit trap that is right in front of the door that's in the south of that space.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** And you were able to hold the panel shut.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** To the west of that room...

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** It looks like you see the outline.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:08]** That's like an entertainment space, probably a bar, lounge area.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** And there are a couple more rooms behind that.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** Those probably storage for that entertainment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Okay.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:22]** So from east to west, there's a bathroom, a waiting room, roughly, and then an entertainment room and a couple of storage areas.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Yep.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Okay.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** How are you doing in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** You got visual?

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Yeah.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:34]** Yeah, I have a rough layout of area and what rooms are what, and I shut down several traps.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** It would not have been fun.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Great work, Boom.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Always good fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** But you said there's cameras.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Does he have actual camera access?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Or that would take another roll?

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** That's another roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Can I assist?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** You're welcome to assist, Gara.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** But I rolled 29 anyway, so it's necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:51 - 00:42:14]** cara you you come in or maybe you don't yeah i do come in but uh okay i'm having trouble moving my check there we go benny uh migo here's that conversation like hey uh is there a way we could we could link those cameras to archie we can we can maybe get the drop on some folks while we're moving around the space i'm trying right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:21]** It's probably going to take another five minutes to interface with Archie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:30]** Actually, I'm going to install a... Kara's going to walk up to the... Is there like a feed?

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Like a camera feed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** After the roll.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** After the roll, you can see the cameras.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:40]** Yeah, so you can open up the cameras to see what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Yeah, but I mean, like, there's a signal, right?

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** I have this micro tab that I can install.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** Cool.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** I guess it's on a data pad, so it would have to be on the data pad, right?

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Or a data link, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** Yeah, well, like, I imagine these are... What are you trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Go ahead.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:04]** It allows intercepted data as audio or text or files, whatever is received.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** You can, like, tap it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:18]** Oh, so instead of feeding it to Archie for a real-time update, you're saying you would just tap into this data stream in order to then have it feed to your data pad if there's anything that comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** I guess we can have it on Archie.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Is that better?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:25]** In terms of the difficulty, I'd say you probably know your data tap better.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:31]** I'm going to say it's not easy to just walk into a room and be able to see where the feed is and find the best place.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** It's probably harder to do that with Archie.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** I think with Archie, it would be more of an engineering check because you're going


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:36 - 00:44:06]** have to move in from a from a networking perspective right so you're basically putting in like a like a network Bolin to sniff all the packets passing through yeah with that computer viewing the cameras I would imagine that it'd be pretty easy to see what traffic is coming from their IP TV system to send those cameras to the computer and this reroute that and you're the lead so it should be on your data pad and you would just direct us yeah okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** I'm going to say that's probably a DC 20.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:17]** That feels like a good between, like, not super difficult, not easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** So the installation of this micro tap is DC 18.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:27]** Okay, so that's just to get it in.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** Is that what the micro tap says?

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** Yeah.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Micro tap Starfighter.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Micro tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** It's actually just a little tap for beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:44]** So it's a successful engineering check in 10 minutes of work to put it in.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Okay, cool.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Is it 10 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Yeah, it says 10 minutes of work.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** I feel like we wouldn't take 10 minutes.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Mark one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** This is like a huge thing, though.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** What cameras do we have access to?

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** Like, is it just on this floor or is it for the whole building?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:04]** If you get an instantaneous video, then we should be able to see it right now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Yeah.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** I mean, you can see it now.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** You don't see anything in the bathroom because that's an invasion of privacy.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** You see the conference room.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:14]** You see Lior's office.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:19]** You see the hallway, the interstitial hallway that was between the office and the lobby that you're at now.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** You see the lobby.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** You see the waiting room.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** And you see the entertainment spaces.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** You see that there are two.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** One is a bar.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** One is a lounge.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** You don't see anybody in the lobby.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** You don't see anybody in the interstitial area.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** You see the two vests unconscious in the conference room.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** You see... One's dead.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Sorry, one's dead.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** One's dead, yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Yeah, of course you would know.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Not by my hand.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** In the lounge, you don't see anybody.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** In the bar...

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** You do see two people.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** I'm thinking that it's like in the corner.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:04]** And you see that there is another Yosuke sitting at the bar, also an IFF.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** They're sitting to drink, but they look a little tense.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** And there's a bartender, Hilkey.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** The camera's behind them, so you can't see what they look like.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** But you can see the red skin.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** You can see that it's a female Hilkey bartender.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** And the IFF agent is sitting right in front of them.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:26]** There is a gun on the bar and the Yusuke's hand is on it.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** That's all that you can see from here.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:37]** There are other feeds of like, you can see other spaces set up of other feeds that are meant to be on other floors, but you can pretty much just see what's in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:58]** um is the um you said there was like a kind of like a layout of the facility in a way because it had like an interface to disable those traps right yeah yeah um is there like a back like the kitchen into the into the bar


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:20]** there's there is a storage area there's not like food you do see that that there's uh probably behind the camera like right like at the bottom of the camera right out of view there is a door that you can just make out like it's like clear where somebody would walk in the back to get more drinks or supplies or whatnot but there's not a back way in from there

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:27]** You see that there is a door in the, like, the kitchen is to the west.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:32]** Yeah, the kitchen or the bar, right, is on the west where I'm pinging.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** Right above it is the lounge, and there's a door to the outside.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** So if you recall, when you were outside, you were looking.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** There were three doors.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** There was the one that goes into Leora's office.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** There was one that goes into Interstitial, and there was one on the far left.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:48]** That far left door is a lounge door.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:56]** So you could theoretically go outside into the lounge and then come straight down into there.

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:02]** Or there's a door behind where the Yusuke is sitting.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:05]** So I'm going to ping on the map here that you see that there are two doors.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** I'm pinging where both of those doors are.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:13]** The door that is on the right here, a little lower, that's directly opposite the bar.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:26]** So if you're trying to be tactical, you could come into the right directly behind the bar, behind this IFF agent in full view of the bartender, or you could come in on their side at the top of the room from the door that's outside.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** It's a lot of information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:45]** And when I did the, um, when I used my nanite array, uh, you think that that periphery, uh, feel that you got was from probably the, the Yosuke at the bar, maybe like tapping their foot, uh, still unclear.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** Um, but definitely somebody in the bathrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:53]** I think there's someone in the bathroom, so we should clear it before moving on and then coming into the bar.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** What do you say?

**[00:48:54 - 00:49:00]** We could storm both, you know, blitz both entrances at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** All right.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** I'm standing by.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Ready to breach.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** I see this to the feet, the bogeys.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** So I agree that is good path forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Let's get them first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Let's clear this bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Follow your lead, Gara.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** To the bathroom.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Let's get it.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:21]** And Migo is going to step up and open the bathroom door.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Is it the men's room?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Is it the women's room?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Is there like non-gendered lavatories?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** There's just a sign.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** There's just a sign for a bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** All right.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** He opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** You see that you are in the sink area.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** You know how sometimes there's like a head sink area that you can go into?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** There's a door to your left and a door to your right.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:49]** I am going to assume that some of it is split for maybe for gender, maybe for overflow and just capacity.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** Not sure what they would do here in Starfinder.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Could be for anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:57]** So we all file into the bathroom.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Hey, Kara, what...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** You're all standing in the cold light of the bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** Where's that life you felt?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** To the left or to the right?

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** Left.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Ready?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** All right, newbie.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** You're standing in front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:16]** I was like, Cara, just... Let's not let Cecil go first, I think.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** Cecil, are you going to do it or are you going to move out of the way?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Pick one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** No, I'm in.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:23]** Are you guys, like, as players, ready?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** I'm trying to think because...

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** If I open the door, that's a move action.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** And then can I ready an action to attack?

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** How is everyone on health, by the way?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** None of your business, John.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Let's just set the stakes here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:37]** I'm at 10 of 32 stamina.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** I'm not into health yet.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Okay.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** I'm not into health either.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** I'm at 29.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** 24 of 32.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** 15 of 27 stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Okay.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** So we're all still in stamina.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Everybody's fine.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** No one's at full though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** No.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** No.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** The bathroom monster will be the hardest one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:55]** The bathroom is the boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:58]** You see a giant pesky Rivener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:04]** Cecil opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** I was going to talk about your ready to action, but you kick the door open.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:13]** You see before you on your... I'm just going to go with the orientation of the game here.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:20]** You see that on the right is another long row of two sinks, and on your left...

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:24]** You see a urinal on the right, and then on the left you see three stalls.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** The doors are closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** Cecil's going to step in knowing there's no traps now.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** He's going to step into this corner.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** There's no traps.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** There's a Clyde.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:33]** Yeah.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:40]** And then he's going to step into this corner and then duck down and look underneath to see if he can see anybody's feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** There is a...

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** Of the neon lights.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Or the fluorescent lights.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** The hum of the lights.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** The fluorescent.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** And it's just the cold white of the bathroom.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** Totally different than the warm lobby out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:59]** Yeah, that didn't at all sound like a monster when you're like...

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Sorry, you said the left?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** That totally sounds like the hum of lights.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** I know, I know.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** It's not terrifying at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:09]** Is this an American stall, or can I see where I can see through the bathroom?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Or is it a European stall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** You can't see at all, yeah.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** It's a European stall.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** I like to think that Akitana is a bit more of a European flavor.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** What does this bathroom smell like?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** So you're saying I don't see any feet underneath, or you're saying I can't see them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** You can't see any feet.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Give me a perception check, Migo.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Or anybody else that walks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Natural 20.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Natural 20.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:32]** That's a lot.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** That is... 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Yeah, what a question.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** 27.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Doesn't smell great.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** 21.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** You know what it smells like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** You know what it smells like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** It smells like your courtesy flush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Ew.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** Uh... CSL's gonna move down and stand...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** You want to get into squeezing rules?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** You're going to make me pull out squeezing rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:13]** Yeah, I will if it's an issue.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** Benny.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** Hey, Migo whispers into his phone and says, hey, let's pick a door.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** We'll do a three count.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Kick them all open at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** I got reach, so I can cover all three.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Just start kicking them.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** All right, let's kick them.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Boom is at the top.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Not in front of a stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** The door is behind us.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** Migo is standing in front of a stall with the tink, tink, tink of a grenade rolling across the floor.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** It is time for boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:16]** Miko is standing in front of door number one, stall door number two, or directly in front.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:23]** Cecil is five feet away from squeezing from door number two, and Carl is also squeezing in front of door number three.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** They're all shut.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** So what's the plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:29]** Miko's going to kick the door open one at a time, and we're going to take down what's over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Miko is pitching to kick all three doors open at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** How do you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Because there's four of us.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Ah.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Yeah, go ahead, Boob.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Step up.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** And three doors.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** And three doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** All right, so I guess, yeah, boom, boom can all kick it out of the door.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** That's not a problem.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Which door am I kicking down?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** Boom, boom, take it out of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Middle door.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Okay.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** You got door number three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Yeah.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** And she's got out her attack lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:58]** And if you guys are using melee weapons, you all get a plus two from my swarmer ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Nice.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:06]** You see the hammer start to electrify and it goes right in.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** All right.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** Woof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Okay.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** So, so literally don't have any handheld.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** They're all in the other bathroom.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:17]** So to be clear, Cara, you are going to open the door with your tech lash.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Cause you're five feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** Yeah.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** I need somebody to open it or I can, or you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Okay.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** So, but so the three of you are right in front of the door.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Okay.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** All right.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** And Cecil's right behind you.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** And Cecil, you're readying an action to do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** I'm standing on the sink instead of squishing.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** You're standing on the sink.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Yeah.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Okay.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** And I got my pike to go over to their shoulders.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:39]** There's going to be some cover there if we figure out what's happening.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** That's fine.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Okay.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** All right.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** And you guys are going to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** All right.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** You ready?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** On my mark.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** Ready.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** Three, two, one.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Mark.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** Mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Of course.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** I knew you were going to do that.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** I knew it.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Of course, man.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Of course.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Of course.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Kicking open the bathroom doors.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Amazing.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Amazing.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Good stuff.
