**[00:01:17 - 00:01:24]** Welcome to We'll See the Podcast!

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** We'll See!

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** We'll See!

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** I'm your bartending GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Bartending.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** Joined by my... Slinging in bottles.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:36]** My favorite patrons, Kelly Gilliam, William Garrett, Benny Rodriguez, and Kevin Decker.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:37]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:46]** We're only, like, 12 episodes in now that you've been doing this adjective thing, and I finally learned that it's always an adjective from the last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Something from the last episode.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Can I blow your mind?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** I've been doing it since we started, like, back with book three.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I don't know how many.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** I honestly just haven't been counting how many episodes that's been.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Sorry.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** You mentioned it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:04]** You said you were going to do adjectives, but you didn't specify that they were going to be from the previous episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** You know who else said something?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's very specific.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Kelly said something.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** He said, hey, I'm going to be somewhere.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Where are you, Kelly?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Don't tell us where you are.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Don't tell.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:20]** Give us facts, and we will do a geoguessor to try and figure out where you are.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** This is what I want to know.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Maybe even down to the street.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** I got to pull up a fresh Google.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Fresh Google Maps here.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** The look of exasperation that happened in that silence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** What is something that you can see from nearby?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Oh, great.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Great idea.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Great idea.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** What can you see from nearby?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** There's a place called, like, Big Boys here.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Big Boys.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** That's slick.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Yeah, there's a place called Big Boys.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Big Boys.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** And then, yeah.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** I'm trying to think what else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Are we allowed to use Google for this?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** You have to.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** You have to.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:59]** This is like GeoGuessr, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Hold on, let me scroll across the Pacific.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** There it is.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** I went too far south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** I was in Taiwan.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Alright, big boy.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Found it.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Did you really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** Big Boy Japan is a restaurant group that operates 274 restaurants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** You just need to filter it down from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** I only see two on Google Maps, so I don't know.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** This looks really good, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** It was a little misleading.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** I'm in a new place.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:28]** I feel like I've seen this before somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Yeah.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Okay, wait.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** You've seen Big Boy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Yeah.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** I need a big boy.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** How does that song go?

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** It's like I need a big boy song.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:41]** You are still in Japan, you said?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** I'm in just a different place.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** I'm going to be leaving Japan soon, though.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** Like in a couple weeks, and then you can guess.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** But you're in a different part of Japan.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** But where?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** I'm in a different part of Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Okay, so you can see a big boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** One of those like 200 whatever locations.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** All right.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** I'm next to like a big boy and then like directly next to the station.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** And there's also something called like a Kura sushi here.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Kura.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** We actually have them in LA.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Kura sushis.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** I'm calling it an American style.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** American style pronunciations.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:09]** Kura.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** K-U-R-A.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:36]** i meant in between all that revolving sushi oh yeah guess where i'm at yeah the revolving sushi okay so i need to find where there's a big boy a metro station and a cura revolving sushi bar yeah good luck because there's probably like 15 places like that but i'm in one of those 15 places okay wow so if our listeners can figure this out and pinpoint your location what kind of prize they're gonna get yeah kelly what do they get i'll send you a sushi from like the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:49]** Maybe I'll personally pay for and send you a piece of Will Save merch if you can actually guess the station that I'm at.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** Actually, this is the biggest clue.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** And they could be bullshitting, so I don't know.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:03]** But the people that live in this particular area say, and the name indicates this, because in Chinese slash Japanese characters, it says like...

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:29]** well how do i say this without giving it away like um like best tea shops in the world basically is actually what like the the kanji mean when they're combined i'm at the place that supposedly the the shogun and his retinue would like go through like ages and ages ago to like you know stop on their way to kyoto and like have like a bunch of like really good teas and stuff like that so not that's a good indication it's not kyoto it's

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** On the way to Kyoto, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** Everywhere is on the way to Kyoto.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** At any point, you are on the way to Kyoto.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** That's true.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Whether you make it there or not, it's a different question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** Best tea shops in the world is the name of the place that I'm at.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** If you can figure that out, then I'll send you some merch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** Limit to one person.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Void where prohibited.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** Restrictions may apply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** Wait, so you won't send me merch, if I figure it out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** If you guess the answer, you should DM me, because people actually do want to play this.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** I'm DMing you right now, because I think I figured it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Kelly, you seem like... It's a pretty good clue.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Yeah?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** What's up?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** No, no, no.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** Oh, yeah, go ahead.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:16]** I was just going to say, you seem like you're in a certain type of mood, man.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** You good?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** You seem like you're...

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** And I'm in a bad mood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Oh, you're in a bad mood.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** Yeah.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Did you say mood?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Oh, hold on.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** Sorry.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Vinny DM'd me.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Oh.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Where did you DM me?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** On Discord.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** No, it's not that.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** I'm sorry.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** Oh, fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Dang.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Wow.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Shut down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:40]** Best tea shops in the world or actually more accurately, the actual characters mean...

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:50]** basically like tea shops under heaven is more accurate or under the sky but the meaning is like best tea shops in the world so that if that helps you

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:59]** I'm not in a good mood because, like, I'm using two... In order to, like, handle... Because we try very hard at Will Save to give you, like, a very good visual audio experience and whatever.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** We try to run, like, the best, like, recording software.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** And the laptop that I'm on kind of sucks.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** So, I have two laptops with me.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** And even then, they were having troubles, like, running those things, like, separately.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Like, all the equipment.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** So, I need to upgrade my, like, hardware setup.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** But we got delayed on recording.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** So...

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** It's all dead.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** I got so angry.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** I saw a ferret.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** There was a ferret just chilling on the ground the other night.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:26]** Never mind.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** I'm not going to say why.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:33]** Ferret population centers of Japan.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** Okay, it did not occur to me that ferrets live in the wild.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:39]** I just thought that ferrets were f***ing pets because they are pets here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:42]** Every pet, though, is a wild animal.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** I didn't think about that.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Or has a lot of animal equivalent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Like a f***ing hole somewhere.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** Are you near the Arishiyama bamboo forest?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** No, I'm not near there.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** That's in Kyoto.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Or around Kyoto.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** And actually John DM'd me and he got it.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** I did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Woo!

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** We'll save mercy when I come.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** This is great.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Oh, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Good stuff.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** John's going to order the most expensive thing.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:11]** He's going to order the bomber jacket that we have in the queue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** He's going to order the discontinued ugly Christmas sweater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** Dude, that's what I'm really hoping for.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Arashiyama is very cool though, Will.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** It's one of the places that I definitely recommend you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** Kelly, was it a ferret or a Japanese weasel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Which is apparently a thing.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** It could be a weasel.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I took a video of it last night.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** You should post it.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** Yeah, I will.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:57]** i take i've yeah i've been taking a lot of shots of like haunted looking like middle of the night stuff and it was just there chilling out those liminal space moments in japan yeah dude love it oh my gosh these are so cute you need to start posting those somewhere you do man i need more of that in my life that's my background all right i'll post


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:02]** Yeah, dude, I will use it as my background here, and it'll be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Good job, John.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:07]** I'm still very happy that you got it.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** This place is a place I'm very familiar with.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** That's why I popped back here.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** I have some friends in this area, and my host family from a million years ago is from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** So if you think you might know where it is, post in the Discord with your guesses.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** My next challenge is trying to get your cross streets.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Because you gave us your landmarks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** The big boy is the big clue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** For sure.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Big boy and train station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** Okay.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Love it.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Love it.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** I'll DM you.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** We got another guesser here.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** I think Kev's just given up.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I'm giving up, yeah.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Kev didn't even try.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** He didn't even try.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Kev doesn't care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** He doesn't care about my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** He typed in Japan in Google.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** I wasn't the first to get it, so I gave up.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** That's it.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** That was his guess.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** I wasn't the first to get it.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:58]** Speaking of liminal spaces, I feel like we're in a liminal space now between banter and playing.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** I don't even know what liminal means.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** We should play.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** You should Google it after you Google Maps Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** I'll look that up, Will, but that's not it.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:13]** I've never heard of that, so I want to figure out where that is, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Maybe I'm hallucinating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Are we playing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** Is that what we're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** We're playing.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** We need to do that.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** We do.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** We probably should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:30]** Look, it's a good chance to just hang, play some Starfinder for an hour.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** And I wanted to make the most of the hour.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Just to hang out.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** You all packed a bunch.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:47]** You all were waiting in front of three bathroom stalls, kicking open the door, and then blowing this Vesk, chilling on the toilet.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Blowing him away.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Then you go in.

**[00:10:51 - 00:11:01]** I think these past UFs have been the fastest that you guys have been moving through these spaces, making decisions, being tactical, getting information, operating on that information, pivoting going forward.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** You know that there are people in this entertainment area.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** There's two.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:12]** You saw from the video footage that there was the bartender and an IFF Yosuke sitting there who was mad.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:17]** Yosuke was mad that they weren't on that main kidnapping team team.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** Just miss that opportunity when you're trying to... Shucks.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** Just try to make it in the ranks of the IFF.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** It's tough.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** You really got to...

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:33]** you got to manage up a lot and they weren't doing a good job, you know?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** And, you know, maybe they were willing to surrender as they were nursing their drink.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:45]** And then when you all broke in from two locations, they pulled their gun out of muscle memory and you guys took them out.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:58]** Talk to Rose a little bit, find out a little bit more about them and make sure that she moves out safely as you all continue deeper into the facility.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:07]** Your seismic detector, you put it down right on top of the panel that is supposed to be the pit trap that you all deftly disabled.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:13]** And with the seismic detector, you're like, hmm, what is that hum at like?

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:34]** four hertz it's real low it's not even perceptible barely an amplitude to pick up on the meter you're hitting the floor of the meter here and you're like all right you know what let's go in and bolt says hey i think you might be on the right path but just fyi this beacon this emergency beacon deeper in the

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:46]** And as I'm about to put you all onto the map, I believe we ended with you all opening the door into the residential wing.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** Yeah.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:54]** And then there was like a Yosuke that was hiding behind a desk and another Yosuke popped up.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Wait, what was that?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** We fought Yosuke.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Yeah.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** That was maybe a couple episodes ago.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** But I'm just saying, we fought them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** You did.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** You also continued your hatred against death.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** The second desk is dead now.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** It won't haunt you anymore.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** In your dreams or elsewhere.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Alrighty.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:16]** You open the door and realize... Wait, did we say we opened the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** I don't remember opening the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** On the map, could you show the door?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Because I forget if we opened it or not.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** I'm pretty sure we opened it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** It's the one at the bottom of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Bringing it back to the new office here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** We went to look at the data room.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Did we put the tap in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:36]** You did put the tap in in order to check the cans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Then we stacked up on the bottom door and...

**[00:13:39 - 00:14:03]** we like instantly took out the person at the bar and that person like had like a connection to them in a weird way they really liked their kidnapper slash yeah i don't remember putting that in the notes but you know if that's what came through it seemed like maybe they just wanted to maybe they want to get out of the i seem concerned about what we're gonna do with clive yeah yeah they were friends was it the stockholm syndrome i think will brought up or someone did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** That might be a little too far, but you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** The door's not open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Maybe it was the start of something.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Or maybe they're like an ex-boyfriend.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Yeah.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Clive?

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** You're holding me hostage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** What are you doing here?

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** What are you doing here?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Wait, is Clive dead or alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Oh, he's alive still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** He's dead.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** God, Clive, this is just like our third anniversary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Wait, wait, let's see.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** No, not at all.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Yeah, the time you died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** Our third anniversary.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** You asshole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** You asshole.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** You died.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** You keep dying.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:57]** every anniversary you never show up class middle name is kenny that's why she didn't react that big of it that's why that's why she's like it's just each time there's something special apparently clive is unconscious so yeah cora switched to a non-lethal weapon could we let rick like kill clive and see how the bartender reacts just to see if like they're associated


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:08]** I just keep thinking Rick all the time just because you know it's Kevin unethical experimentation Batman yeah I don't know man alright so did you open the door?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:25]** I did not open the door the door's not open oh wait I remember I put down like a seismic thing boom boom and then you said there was something there yes there was a hum on the other side of the door and then so is there a peephole on the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** there's not a peephole


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Hmm.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** Is there any way we can see what's exactly on the ups?

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** Okay.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** I'm just going to open the door.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Um, let me make sure I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:41]** Use her, uh, electro location, uh, adaptation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Okay.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** Remember, Cecil, you will not die, and you will not have to bring back your dead body.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** You will live.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** So do not fear an open door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:59]** The electro-location graft, probably along, like, I mean, is it, is it go deep into, like, a mountainside?

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Like, underground?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:06]** You know that this is the entrance into the residential wing.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Okay.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Possibly one of the rooms.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** I don't know why you gave that air quotes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** We're assuming that the floors are decoupled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:17]** Because there's no such thing as a residential wing in an office building.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** This is a different time and place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** Think of it this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** Think of it like two buildings that share a wall.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:31]** Actually, Kevin, as long as we're talking about traveling and this part of the world, they do have it like that.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** They'll have workspaces in like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** Yeah, but you wouldn't live in the same built... What about Blade Runner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** What about Blade Runner?

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** That's like... He lived in the place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** She's rich as f***.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** She built her own shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:56]** Why is it... It's just like having a parking garage that's attached to the office, except instead of parking your car, you park your body and your stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:00]** I guess I lived on a submarine for too long where I lived and worked in the same space.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** I will never want to do that again.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:07]** Then again, you do that from home, but it's different because it's like my office.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** This is my office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Yeah.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** And then you get out of there and then you go to your residential part of your house where you like live and eat.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** And then at 5 p.m.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** you go to sleep like, you know, upstairs in the same building that you work in.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Okay, moving on.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I'm opening the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** I'm opening the door.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** 5 p.m.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** is late.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** Okay.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:28]** Kev, thank you for choosing this facet of this imaginary game to be upset with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** You know, Kevin, as far as things to die on go, and I know you choose many, this was my favorite one.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Oh, yes.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Yeah.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** When I look over the field of hills, a lot of them have Kev's flag on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** It's just like Kevin's dead on each one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** Different Kevins.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** What's the order that you all go in?

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Cecil's first.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Cecil's first.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** And then?

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Did I open the door?

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** The door's not open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** I want Migo behind Cecil.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** I feel like Migo's trying to do his best to look out for Cecil's dead body, if nothing else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** And then Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Boom is spinning in circles.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:08]** Sorry, I'm trying to... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Just look forward.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** What is wrong with you?

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** So, who is bringing out the rear?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:17]** Let's just do a little process of deduction.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** Who's going in last?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:41]** boom or car oh well boom isn't one to go in last okay so i think boom would want to go behind cecil if if if you'll allow it that's what boom wants to ask for sure ask me go i think the two of you start to walk into the door at the same time me go cecil and i i you know kind of like my trainee so let me uh let me bank him up yeah cecil looks at you i'd

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:51]** Also, Migo, you're not the best at pep talk, so I feel like for morale purposes, it's probably best you stay a little bit further away from Cecil.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** Migo, you stay as close as you need to for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** I prefer... Mr. Grenade Hands over here, you don't want him looking over your shoulder?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Just don't cower behind any desks.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** You'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Copy that.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** All right, I opened the door.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Why won't the door open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Kev, you need to just take a chill pill, buddy.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** Okay?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** I know that you're mad at this whole idea of the way the room's laid out.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** You open the door to the residential district.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** He's just like shaking the door knob.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** To the residential district.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Or area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:34]** It's the... It's the... So much to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** It's the mud room.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:42]** I'm waiting for John to say, the door's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** I thought he said it was unlocked last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** You did.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** You were able to unlock the door.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** It's good.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** It's good.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** You can go in.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Just picture in your mind.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Go with me.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Okay?

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** On this imaginary train.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** We're leaving.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** It's a train now?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:23]** the remaining sunlight leaves a warm glow in this immense home office and library everything in the 20 foot high space feels right in its place each of the rows and rows of bookshelves on every wall have the perfect amount of books the chair behind the modest dark wood desk sits ready for use

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:33]** and the geometric patterns on the tile, all pulling your eyes towards one thing in the center of the room, the large circular statue.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:43]** Different shaped broken pieces of a metal orb float lazily, held in place by this glowing blue ball in the center of the orb.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:49]** Just enough light leaks out to leave a blue haze.

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:10]** in the room mixing with the yellow of the sun there's another door on your left and windows along the south and west wall above the fireplace hangs a moving portrait of similar colors blue gray and a little yellow gonna bring you guys in

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:16]** When you open to the door, you realize that the door is technically one leaf of a double door on this side.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** So I've put you all roughly in an order that you might come in.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** Archie comes in behind you.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** And Boom starts rotating in place, looking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** I don't know why you were rotating the table.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** I'm on a different keyboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** What do you all do?

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:38]** Well, we would probably come in tactically and like door opens.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:41]** I'm going to move out towards the left.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** This place is nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Scanning the room with my weapon out.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Do I need to roll perception?

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Do you want to roll perception?

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** What did you say was a statue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** So there's this... The middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** It's an amorphous thing.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Yeah, this, like, statue.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** I see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** What does it mean?

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** Uh, culture check.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** And then he's gonna throw a grenade at him.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** No.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** Um... Kara, no.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** 21, please.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:32]** amazing uh it's a 21 for like the orb yeah the orb it looks like a very interesting piece of art there's a lot more control and mechanical capability to this thing

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:46]** You notice that on the back, as you're walking around, you can see both sides of the floating pieces of metal that are just slowly moving lazily, like floating along a river.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:54]** You can see on the back that there are small devices laid along the back of the statue.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** But otherwise, it just looks like a strange piece of art.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** Perception check on the whole room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:09]** Kara is going to, like, scan the perimeter near the windows, check to make sure that, like,

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Are these open?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** Are things locked, kind of?

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Yeah.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Like, the window's secured?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:22]** And then move to the desk and look through the desk and this sort of, like, back cabinet area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** I got 11 for perception.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** 11, you don't notice anything.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:31]** Again, there's a painting on the wall, a bunch of books.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** Kara, you find that...

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** the door is secured and the windows are secured.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:49]** When you go up and look out, you see that the way that this residential wing is oriented, there's still a lot of sunlight coming in in the same way that the...

**[00:23:49 - 00:24:10]** when you all first were dropped off on the roof there and it looks out over into a small garden that looks upkept but pretty much unused it's maybe like it's it's it's like a nice rooftop garden you can see another wing across the way uh but otherwise totally unused


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** John, I would like to register a Kevin-style complaint.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:22]** So earlier, the light coming in, it was more like an afternoon setting sun kind of light, and this one's more like a morning sun.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** So I just wanted to note that.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** This is moonlight now.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** It's very bright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Which means Liara's already dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** John, is there anything in the desk?

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Thank you.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** Can I roll, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:34 - 00:25:04]** uh are there any traces or tracks um that i could roll to see like where they might have gone or also is there like any like i feel like there might be a secret passage in this place so y'all have secret slime there's this painting thing it looks kind of suspicious cara give me a survival check you you do see that there's a computer sitting on top of the desk i got a also boom give me a 25

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:10]** 25 survival perception from Boom, and then we'll get to Migo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Boom got like 20, 22 perception.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** 20 or 22?

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:14]** 22.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Migo, you had your hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:42]** uh yeah i think migo is going to be working around the right side of the room looking at the bookcases to see if there's any one any titles he recognizes to any any like uh any books that would relate liara to this uh group that has kidnapped her and three anything that looks like it could trigger a secret door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Okay.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** And Cecil, you raise your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** I'm just going to get all the answers ready.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:49]** I rolled a 25 on engineering for the orb.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Kara, you were first.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** You rolled really high on the survival, trying to see what's going on.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:04]** It seems like this area was touched, you think, by one person.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:09]** So it seems reasonable that in this part of the room, there's not much going on.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:20]** maybe you rolled pretty high enough that you look over and you're like huh the way the rugs is sitting seems like there was more foot traffic over in the north end of the room

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:27]** Migo, you were doing a scan along the right side to see what the titles are.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:34]** The titles are like the 25 Laws of Power and How to Be the Best CEO Ever and things like that.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** And just all these very leadership-y self-help books.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** Some novels and fiction that you're interested in.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:50]** Nothing that ties that you see there that ties Leora to the IFF.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:55]** There are a lot of books on, you think, like... What's the best way to say it?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** Study of precognition.

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** Ooh.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:04]** And then... Cecil, you were doing an engineering check on the orb.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:12]** Oh, and both Kara and Miko, again, the computer in front of you, seems like that's been used.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:17]** Sorry, that's something, Kara, that you would pick up, is that maybe on the computer you're like, oh...

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** I recognize this screen and the order of things.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:26]** This is a screen that occurs right when it's been being used and then somebody's walked away.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** So it's kind of the screensaver.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** So there might be something there.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** Cecil, you're looking at this orb and you're like...

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:36]** There is, again, there's a lot more capability here.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** You think there are these, like, the devices on the back of each piece of metal seem to be like IDs.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** They're transmitting information somewhere.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:51]** And you also notice that in the center...

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** Oriented towards the window, there's a solar detector that picks up the incoming light.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:06]** It is obviously being impacted by this blue light that you think is some sort of EM holding things in place in a stasis.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** Nothing special to that technology.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Maybe you've seen something like that before.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:17]** I want to say that, boom, you're watching the painting and you're like, it's moving.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** you see something in the center moving bluish.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:26]** And then you see these blurry, like impressionist kind of figures moving.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** You count them.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** There's four of them.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:40]** And you, you look and you're like, the one that just walked over from the desk to where you are, that, that was kind of like Cara.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:46]** And then the one that's moving around the blue thing, that,

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** That's... Is that Cecil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Dope.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:57]** Wait, this... I believe... So it's like a mirror, but it's like a face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** This is like some magical mirror.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** The figures in here do exactly what we do.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Look, I wave at it.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Look, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** It's me waving back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Right?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:15]** The reason you said, here, I'm going to wave at it, is because 20 seconds before, you saw somebody waving in the painting.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** What the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:40]** this no no is it another dimension is it like no it's a precog mirror oh that's right oh yeah this is like roly's mind palace basically great i see that's that's the best way i could probably put it all right that's dope what are you thinking uh intriguing well the artifact we have here okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** Hey, Boom, we got another computer over here.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** You want to have a look at it?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** Oh, but of course.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Where is it?

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** It's over here next to the window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** You can just follow the figure moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** So there's only two doors into this room.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yeah.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** There's the one to the west.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** It looks like it leads outside.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** And there's one to the north that we came through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Yeah.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:03]** And again, the one to the west is locked.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:20]** from the inside a locked okay i locked yes that's the that's the sorry i slipped into my morrow accent uh where they put ah before everything so i already used my secret slime but you guys all have some right nobody confirmed that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** I mean, that's all part of her kit, you know?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I still have some, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Boom, were you looking at the computer?

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** And Kara, what are you thinking?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:30]** Because I feel like Kara's having like a Sherlock kind of moment.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** You're like walking in the middle of the carpet.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** You're like looking at the painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:40]** Yeah, I guess like you said up here was more foot traffic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** Yeah.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** You think the foot traffic clearly wasn't going towards the door on the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:55]** What about these statues or any of the white thing that I'm sort of nearby on the carpet?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** The white thing on the carpet is just a coffee table, and there's a lamp next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Oh, lamp.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** Yeah.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:11]** But the way it's bunched, yeah, you think traffic moved towards that section of the wall, that northeast section of the wall.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** Boom, you were going to look at the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Secret entrance kind of thing.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** Yeah, Boom looks at the painting and he wonders if in 10 seconds from now he's going to be successful.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Does he see him celebrating or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** Just watch the painting and see what happens.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:31]** If you watch it long enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** He rolled a 19 computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:38]** Okay, I have something for you too, Kara.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** In just a minute.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** That's enough to get into the computer.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** You're able to hot end.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:49]** You think, since you got into the security, this one's not too bad.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** It was definitely tough, but not too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Improfessional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** You think that...

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Mostly what you see are emails.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** That's the program that's open.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:07]** You thumb through it, flick through, see some things in the preview pane.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** You see two types, generally, of emails.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Three, I guess.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:24]** One, business as usual, status updates on the construction, status updates from other offices, corporate stuff, corporate stuff.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Then you see some emails with the stewards.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:35]** Stewards, mostly, Leora's just cc'd on these emails.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Sometimes she chimes in.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** It just seems to be that they're requesting a lot of information about the history of steward spaces on Akiton.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** Dig a little further and you think, they're asking a lot about the draws, right?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:54]** They're really pushing the boundaries of the relationships between the stewards and the private sector.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:03]** They're claiming that there are ringwork security issues that they need to know so they can need to be aware of the system.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** Of course, the stewards are pretty reticent to share anything about that.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Do you all know what the draws are?

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** No.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:17]** The draws are not confirmed by anybody in the public.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:28]** that the stewards have an ability to mobilize very quickly because at certain bases, they have these interplanetary portals that can teleport.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:36]** That's part of why they've been able to be so successful at maintaining order and moving troops when they need to.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:40]** Of course, no one's been able to confirm it.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** It's one of the highest levels of stewards' access there.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:51]** You see another set of emails, a couple things here and there, from some names that you're like, I don't know.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** what this is.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** I'm not, not, not sure where this is coming from.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:01]** It's all linked to an at sc.edu essentially.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:19]** And as you're going through, you see some of the signatures in the emails and so-and-so is like head researcher at singularity, sorry, singularity conservatory, uh, you know, like part-time professor, you know, adjunct.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** And if you, uh,

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:29]** if you want to give me a culture check or anybody who's aiding to figure out more, you know, that you've heard of the singular singularity conservatory.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:36]** It's a, it's a selective institution, uh, founded for training precox.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** That's, that's kind of all that you know about it.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:42]** But I think if you want to know more, you could do a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Yeah.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Boom.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** We'll, we'll do this.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Um,

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:50]** Again, very Rolu-esque to me.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Not boom.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** 24 for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Yeah, you're thinking back.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:58]** You're like, this place was cool for some reason, but interesting.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** It's weird.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:09]** You remember the reason why this school is so successful is because it's located very close to the event horizon of a black hole.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:14]** So there's time distortion just getting there.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:43]** and a lot of times they you will go in and study and uh you know that that time dilation there's a lot that happens a decade or more passes but you can get a lot of things done and then in your research and then you come out and take new advances because times move so quickly out there you can update your things your technology a lot quicker and you recall also that uh

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** The school's a little controversial.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:56]** They have a thing called the crossing where every X amount of time, faculty, students, and alumni will come together to celebrate the crossing.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:05]** And every conservatory, as it's being built, a second one is being built somewhere else because the first one was built.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:10]** So they knew exactly how much time they had before the school crosses the event horizon.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** And right before it does, they all leave and go to the new school.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:24]** Sometimes people will stay on as it crosses, maybe as part of a retirement, maybe more of a religious significance.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:29]** So it's an odd way of thinking.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** All these emails about this seem to be like...

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:56]** requests for talks or kind of confirming some points about a paper and you think leora must know people here maybe even studied some of the references are very familial like hey professor good to see you again and that's pretty much what you get

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:04]** Kara, you're looking at this painting and you're like, okay, there are definitely faint tracks here of people moving to the painting.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:13]** I can see 20 seconds ahead and then you look over at the

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:28]** statue and you look back and you begin to notice that every time in the painting something moves in front of the blue area it's it's one of the uh pieces of metal

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:36]** And as soon as it moves over, it will become very clear for a few seconds so you can see exactly which piece of metal it is.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:41]** And then it will fade off into wispy trails and keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** Sorry, explain that again.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** This is in the painting that it becomes clear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:58]** Yeah, there's like a rotating, it's like, that's one of the few things that really becomes clear in the painting is like this piece of metal and the shape and everything becomes clear for a second as it's moving in front of the perspective of that, that the painting is painted in.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Right.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** And then it will become wispy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** Like a single piece of metal from that.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Yeah.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:12]** So then Cecil's going to walk over and wait for that piece to come around and grab it from the actual statue itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** You'll you'll grab the piece.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** You'll go see which one it is and go over and grab it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** He'll at least like as it comes around the first time, we'll probably poke at it or touch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:42]** okay uh yeah it just moves a little bit and then comes back boom i don't think boom would know this but kelly's curious like uh like uh this isn't by any chance like sort of the same sort of bluey glowy material that we see in other parts of threefold is it no it's not okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Much lighter, paler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:50]** Well, you mentioned the stewards, so they had... So, who did an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** That was you.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Cecil did.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** Cecil, you do that, and then you look at the solar detector.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:05]** And then you look at the IDs on the back, and you're like, all right, the solar detector is in...

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:10]** is in the path of the sun.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:21]** And you think, I need to match the right piece at the right time with the right rays of the sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** It's like a Tomb Raider game.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** And maybe something will happen.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** Maybe there's a link there.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** Is there a mirror somewhere or can I manipulate the pieces?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** You could probably take the piece off if you wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:56]** yeah i think i could probably use the one opaque piece to block the sun from the solar sensor why do you want to block the sun without we're going to light light it with the sun well like it's already in the sun's rays currently like i think you want to shield it is am i am i interpreting that right like the solar sensor right now is currently being illuminated by the sun

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Yeah.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** So you want to stop that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Cecil will just put his hand over and block the light.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** That doesn't do anything.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:08]** Yeah, he said a certain piece has to align with the solar panel thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** Right, so if you use the piece of metal to block the light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:15]** Okay, so the piece that we recognized in the picture, Cecil's going to grab it.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** You rush over in a 20-second window.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** You're only at 20 seconds?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Why?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Is the whole thing collapsing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** No.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** It's just things seem to move in a 20-second.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** It's about 20 seconds before then.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** So you walk over.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** You have this piece.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** And you block the solar sensor.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Is that what you're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** That's what Miguel recommended?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** Nothing happens.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** But you think to yourself...

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:49]** There's definitely a link between the solar sensor and what's on the back of the metal pieces.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** Those are receiving input, too.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** And so you think, maybe I need to match those.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** So you start turning the piece of metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Sure, yeah.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** I'll flip it over.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** And I match them.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Sorry, I'm having a hard time picturing this in my head.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:05]** It's cool.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It's okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:35]** so you match it i think the whole time he's doing this he's also kind of glancing at that picture okay to see like what's what is going to work yeah yeah of course cara what are you doing um yeah i guess we'll try out seeker slime oh love it okay where do you put the uh near the mirror maybe near the near the picture yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Okay.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:45]** Is there anything here with these, like, blue lighting on the walls or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** No.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Okay.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** No, that just appears to be a light to a drawer beneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:54]** There's not a statue where the head folds back and you push a button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:55]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:01]** But you... I can't, like, play off key on a piano somewhere and, like... Pull a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** It's funny, though.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** You put the Seeger slime up to the painting and it shies away from the painting.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:09]** It just doesn't want to be near the painting.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** But then it starts to...

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:40]** move over around the fireplace and then you see it fireplace move into this like yeah like the mantle around the painting and then it seems to like move into this imperceptibly tiny crack that you did not even think was there fireplace so below it's below the painting it's part of it's around the entire painting okay and at that time you turn the piece of metal

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** and the sunlight hits it.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** And then you see one, ten.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:51]** You see the digits on the back of the piece of metal start to align with the solar energy.

**[00:42:52 - 00:43:17]** sensor and cara you're looking and then you're looking down and looking up and you don't even see as the door starts to swing open and if you look on the map you see that behind the mantle is a stainless steel double sliding dope well knew there was something behind that painting

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:44]** uh boom's gonna put down a seismic thing again okay the nanite blah blah blah you're picking up the hum it feels like that is whatever is driving this art piece is that is part of that hum and there's maybe something else really small though can barely can barely see it it's probably just an electrical blip in the sensor it's probably not probably nothing famous last words probably nothing that's what do you all do well cecil another door for you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:44 - 00:44:05]** So, uh, Cara is going to use one of her nano site arrays, uh, a broad spectrum scanning kit to, uh, a four plus four circumstance bonus to perception checks to search.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Okay.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** What are you searching?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:11]** Um, I'm searching just like this.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:28]** secret entry door way like is there like a how does it do like a an entrance or like yeah there's a there's there's a button that you can push to open it yeah okay yeah guys


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** I got a bad feeling about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:36]** Like, did the kidnappers know about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** They might not expect us to enter this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Hey, do they know about this?

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:50]** I think they've, like, from what we were told by the boss, they've already seen us coming and rescuing Liara.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Like, they gotta see this coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** Wait, are the...

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Are we messing with precogs?

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** I mean, like, I don't know any precogs.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** I never... I heard about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Like... It very well could be.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** I mean, I'm not a precog.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** I don't know what to expect.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** But I know what I've been asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** There's often mystical elements.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** And if it's springing some perverted trap to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:41]** kidnap and kill all the leora huxley and i don't know what else is involved but no but that's what i'm saying though like what if what if leo was in on it this this is her building this is then we'll cuff her we'll take her in too i i don't know i don't know what else to say and we're here to to do a rescue and we'll we'll take her out in cuffs or we'll take her out however we need to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:46]** I don't have reason to believe she's in on it, but something's afoot.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** That's for sure.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** All right.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** I don't like it as much as you do.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** With that, I think Kara's going to push the button.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Cecil's got his gun up.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:00]** He's going to ready an action to shoot if there's any hostiles on his side.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Is there a button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:08]** Can I use the electoral location graph and detect anything through the wall before I push?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:13]** It starts to detect a little bit of something, but you think, oh, there's a change in material here.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Here's a cut.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Yeah.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** From this nice geometric floor grid.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** It's like very like, yeah, 2000s-y.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Same design language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** Wait, the mirror didn't show the mirror opening up.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** I thought you said it was, like, 20 seconds earlier or 5 seconds earlier.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** Like, somebody wouldn't have seen, like, whoa, look!

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** And then everybody turns to watch the mirror show the door open, and then the door's open.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:49]** Yeah, you would have seen that happen as you start to go over, as you grab the right one and it disappears from the blue thing.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** You would have seen that start to happen.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:57]** But you can't see the door opening because the perspective is as if you're on the door.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** So it doesn't look like it's opening.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** No, the whole image would shift.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:11]** Yeah, as you are walking over and doing that, you're seeing the image shift as if the door is opening because it takes a second because it's seeker sliding and all that stuff.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** So yeah, you absolutely see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** This is a really fascinating idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** You all were circling the drain.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Kara was like, okay, there's definitely something up here.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** There's definitely something on this wall.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** The engineering was there.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:30]** The connection there between whatever is going on with this painting and whatever is going on with this statue, you all were like putting the pieces together.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:35]** So it was kind of just a race of who was going to get the secret slime or who was going to put the piece of metal in the sunlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:40]** I think that's just mine and Cecil's issue with that.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:46]** That's a pretty complicated secret door access thing.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** It took us a few minutes to figure that out.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:56]** But if the IFF knows about that, they have some kind of insider.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** And this is Leora's private residence, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** This is her home office.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:05]** Sorry, I don't want to activate you, Kev, by talking about the residential office and a new office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** I'm just going to prepare another hill for Kevin.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Please.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** In the meantime.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Please.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:18]** But, like, I mean, the IFF could have some... I mean, if we could figure it out, the IFF could theoretically figure it out, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:22]** I mean, it's not like they're, like, complete... Doesn't seem like she's the only one who uses this entry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** I'm sure the IFF has a couple good... I don't know how you say brain cookies.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** People with good... I forget the phrase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** Maybe smart people.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** Brain cookies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** I forget the phrase.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:42]** But Boom lights a new cigar, takes out his machine gun.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** He's ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Kara, you push the button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:52 - 00:49:21]** door opens with her flash compliance ready yeah yeah yeah ready to go yeah love it love it it opens you feel another nice warm blast of air come over you as concrete steps descend perfectly straight in front of you and you just see the as lights come on every step and it goes down for a ways

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:27]** And it's like, yeah, it's like watching lights turn on in a tunnel as you see how far it goes.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** It's like descending into the Batcave.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Descending into the Batcave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Exactly.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** The nice one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:41]** And those lights are always very loud because it goes... Yeah, that's... It's like huge relays for each one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:41]** Boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Every single one of them.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** The relays never fail.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** They never, ever fail.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** Also, just want to note, Boom, you didn't destroy the desk.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:57]** So I think whatever therapy you're going to is working.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** We still got time for that.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** When you leave, you're like, that desk is f***ing ironed.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** As we run out, like, you're shooting behind us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** Yeah, he shuts the door.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** Just rolls down the concrete steps.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** Yeah, oh my god.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** For like a day.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Yeah, yeah, forever.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** Yeah, amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** So what do you do?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** You start walking.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:41]** yeah i i can take lead if you want cecil or uh we could go together or what what do you cars already in what's the so what's the margin like a two two wide it's a it's a one wide okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:43 - 00:51:05]** cecil goes first then he's gonna try to okay go after car then okay yeah boom goes after car yeah i'm fine uh i'm fine with me go bringing up the rear okay the rear is the scariest thing to be honest archie's right behind you floating oh there you go you start walking feels like

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** First, it's 50 feet.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:11]** Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Then it becomes 100 feet.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Clip, clip.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Then 200 feet.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Clip, clip.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:21]** You're just walking in this single file stairwell with apathetic walls.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** And after a while, you can't see anymore of the sun.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:31]** It becomes a little prick, the light from that room.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:37]** Until finally, you get to an open door.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** You can see.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** You can see.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Sorry.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** No, it's good.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** It's good.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** It's true.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** It's true.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:55]** Because you come down and you see a little landing and a door is open and it does look a little dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:25]** do you all walk in this is the only exit to this i mean is there a door you said yeah but it's open i don't think amigo would stop okay just keep going yeah just walk over everybody as we we all pause before we go in there okay yeah love it i'm gonna try the electro location graft


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** Ooh, love it, love it.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** 14 on perception.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** 14 perception.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** And what's the electrolocation graph?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:41]** You can feel the presence of other creatures through conductive surfaces, sensors installed in your hands or feet.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** You can do the same.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:50]** So you can come... When you're in contact with a crystalline or metallic surface...

**[00:52:50 - 00:53:00]** You can detect the presence of other creatures within 60 feet that are also in contact with the same surface, even through walls and other obstacles.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** This otherwise functions as blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** How long is that active for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** It's just while I have my...

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Electrolocation loaded.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** And does it take uses or anything?

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** It's a primary nanite array.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** Okay.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:25]** It's in place of a weapon, so it's a legit item to carry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** But does it take a battery or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** I'm just curious what the limitations are.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** It doesn't say that it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Cool.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** I think you don't feel any individual, but...

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:45]** You do feel what I feel like is like a radar thing where it's like you sense that the floor is marble, so you can't really tell too much.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:51]** But there is sort of a ping as if there's a different type of material somewhere else.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** Whatever's beyond this door, there is some other material.

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:24]** material structure surface platform that's not this marble because you do get a faint like ping there right it's like looking at a map and seeing the the dark spot between what you kind of feel it's like coming up to the to the edge of a massive structure and just like right yeah you're like most of this i don't know what's going on it's marble it's not quite but there's there's like a hole there there's something missing there that should be there all right

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** And my perception check didn't show anything?

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** You can see a little bit of dust kind of float in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** What temperature is it?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** What was that?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Is it cold?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Is it colder or warmer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:39]** If I, uh... There's a... The air is warm.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** The smell smells like more books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** Let's watch your incendiary grenades.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Boom.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** A lot of books in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** And with that, he's gonna... I always good time for boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** He's gonna push the door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** You feel like... Oh.

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:04]** Kara is going to pull out one more little technological item, a broad spectrum scanning kit.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** And do a quick perception check.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** And that actually puts it at 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** 27.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:19]** Yeah, this sounds and feels like a bigger space than you were in last time.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** And again, it's still.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** It's quiet.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** You don't pick up any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** A bigger space beyond this door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Yeah.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Bigger than what you were in for the office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** I think Migo's growing impatient.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** Yeah.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Hey, what are we waiting on?

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Can I go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:41]** There's a big... I think whatever's behind this is a lot bigger than...

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:47]** Well, I just get a sense that whatever it is, it's big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Cut it out.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** It'll be good to end to.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Let's go put eyes on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Yeah.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** So she's actually going to equip her weapon.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:01]** You see almost like the sculpture that was in the room of the office before.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:09]** You see emanating from her arm this sort of vibrational...

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:27]** movement of an elite philosopher's lead philosopher's thing that lead philosopher's thing is a weapon that's neat like that like the sound of that all righty that i do have a battery for okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** And what do you guys do?

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** And we go in.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** We open.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** I push the door open.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Yep.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Okay.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** The door's mostly open, so you don't need to really push.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** You just start walking through.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:45]** As you walk and come down onto the landing, you see before you a set of two or three steps as the floor rises back up.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** You walk through this little trough.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Start walking up the steps.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** Stuck in the liminal space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** We started in the liminal space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** We're going to end in the liminal space.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** I do love liminal spaces.
