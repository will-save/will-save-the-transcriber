**[00:00:00 - 00:00:13]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:20]** Welcome to my channel.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:22]** Today I will show you how to make a beautiful flower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** What's up, everybody?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** You've come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:25]** This is We'll Say The Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** We'll Say The Podcast.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Episode 93.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** My name is John Swan.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** I am your Jurassic GM.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:33]** And I am all surrounded here.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Sorry, what?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Aren't you like the second youngest here?

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** I... What?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** What?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:42]** He might be the actual comment, but I'll wait.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** I'll wait until we figure out everyone's name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** A dinosaur comment supersedes all comments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** What's your comment, Kelly?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Right.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Okay.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** I found out.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** I literally looked up play dinosaur race in Starfinder because I was very impressed by that mob that we fought.

**[00:01:55 - 00:02:00]** Apparently, that mob is a Hanukkah, right?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Hanukkah, I don't know.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:06]** And apparently, people do play them.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** You can kind of turn it into a PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** You can play anything you want to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** I want to play a f***ing Hanukkah.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** It looks so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** Kev has one with him in the room right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:32]** yeah okay so apparently like learn the basics of spell casting just as human children that's so cool they can pass spells operating devices i don't know how to do without thumbs but they do things is that here's every time he sees anything so like he'd be like oh my god a dinosaur


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Where are you from?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** I've never seen you before.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** All his characters were homeschooled.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** So they just didn't ever meet anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Here's the bug of the world.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:47]** He's obviously not homeschooled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** I know, I know, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:49 - 00:03:12]** we have not run out of states here but here's basically uh like with the most homeschooled children his his his ship was basically um like a noah's ark basically of like all these different creatures and all he wants to do is just like collect all of them that that that was his main contribution to the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Except for he's never met any creature.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** So he's just starting the arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:26]** In fairness to yours, basically, like, the hyena people just popped into existence, like, basically now in Starfinder.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** I guess he doesn't have an excuse for the dog people, but whatever.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** Because you all are asking, Georgia has the most homeschooled children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** I see North Carolina, Florida, then Georgia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Let's stop insulting states, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** I was just going to let that slide.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** It's not a bad thing.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** I was just curious.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** It's kind of a bad thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It's not.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** Larger question aside.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** All right, Kelly.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** Tell us.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Tell us all about it.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:02]** I have a dinosaur question that supersedes all other questions, and that is, what is your favorite dinosaur?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Where do I begin?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Right?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** I know.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** We're really digging this one up.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** I feel like we talked about this before, but my favorite dinosaur is a fake one.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** What?

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Thank you, Michael Creighton.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:20]** It is the Dilophosaurus, which doesn't spit acid and probably doesn't have frill.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** In fact, it probably has feathers.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:29]** All of that stuff is made up by Michael Creighton for Jurassic Park, but it was always my favorite character, my favorite dinosaur growing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Let me see.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:58]** that is a very respectable one it is a real dinosaur i mean it just doesn't work the way the jurassic park did it yeah i guess um i think mine is an allosaurus because like oh classic dude oh did i steal someone's like did i steal it's the most random dinosaur ever it's basically like a junior dinosaur that pops up when you google dinosaurs alphabetically

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:15]** i mean i literally actually just did that but then i got reminded of an allosaurus okay so like when i was 10 i had to make a dinosaur and i was like i don't want to be like a bitch and do a t-rex like everyone else i'm gonna do another kind of t-rex and then like i had to make like a paper mache one and that's what i made i made an allosaurus rex or whatever it's called how's wow okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:35]** they're pretty cool i mean you know did we just become best friends fun fact montana has the most dinosaur fossils yeah that tracks cool montana yeah yeah mine is also the allosaurus which is interesting uh because i didn't expect anyone else to be like we have a surprising amount of yeah i know what do you mean surprising what does that mean


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** How's that?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** That's an unsurprising amount in common, Vinny.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** I don't know.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** I like to think of myself as a fairly... And you're just being like, I don't even like you, and yet we have all this stuff in common.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:51]** I like to think of myself as fairly unique to find somebody else that's like... We both share that, too.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** We both think that we're unique.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** But I also think you're unique.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Uniquely like me.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Aww.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Aww.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** What about anybody else?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:04]** The largest flying dinosaur, the Pterodon.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** The Pterodon.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** What was it like to see them actually fly?

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Pteranodon.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** What was it like to see them move and do?

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:17]** Really, I commonly just refer to them as dragons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Did you ever ride one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Yes, you can tame them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** When I was a kid, we used to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** When I was growing up, we used to just play hacky sack with them.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** That's great.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Well, I have a question, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Like a falconer, you know, keeps like falcons.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** You keep like pterodactyls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** A pterodactyl.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Can you change form when you time travel?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Because a dinosaur is not really going to know what the hell you are.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Can you just become like a real planet or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** You stay human, Kelly, throughout time.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Does it sense your power?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** So it stays away?

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:50 - 00:07:16]** does it sense your power so so yeah so it's like immediate fear basically well i mean it's like the fear it's like the uncanny valley like you're you were talking about that one time it's like yeah they don't know what it is that they're seeing so they don't know to be afraid or to be uh yeah yeah it's true it's true except the uncanny valley is like something that's like kind of similar but not who you are do you look just enough like a pterodactyl yeah

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** Well, all cats think that humans are just cats.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** They do.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Just bad cats.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Including my newest little kitten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, she does think that.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Everyone's getting cats now.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** John has cats.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Will has cats.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** Everyone's getting them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Follow me on Instagram.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** I feel like you're next, Kelly.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:35]** I know.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I need a cat at some point.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:44]** My favorite dinosaurs for literally no reason, and I don't know why, but they were always, like, Pachycephalosaurus with, like, the chrome dome.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** They were just, like, headbutt.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** Just, like, super intense because they could just yeet people and other animals.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** But they were, I think they were herbivores.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** So, you know, they're, like, chill unless you f*** with them and then you find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** That's like...

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** They're like hippos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Pachycephalosaurus.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Pachycephalosaurus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Pachycephalosaurus, yeah.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** It kind of looks like Paul Giamatti if you were like in this movie.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** Like a Paul Giamatti.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** It's the Paul Giamatti dinosaurs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Grayson has an ABC book for dinosaurs.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** It's a pop book, so like every dinosaur you pop it as you read it.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** And I'm pretty sure half of them are fake.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** I was like, that's not real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** A coloradosaurus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** I watched this TED talk one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:29]** That's like the monkish looking one with the dome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** Yeah, it's got like the rim of hard, bumpy.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:38]** But there was this TED talk I watched one time that was talking about how there's no baby dinosaurs.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:44]** We have eggs, and then we have several different versions of dinosaurs.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** Adult dinosaurs.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** There's no juvenile dinosaurs.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:57]** And the whole discussion was saying that our whole idea, our human understanding of what dinosaurs were, is that there's thousands of different species.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** But in reality, it might only be hundreds.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:17]** That they're probably evolutionary-wise limited and that what we're seeing is when you see a Triceratops versus a Ceraton or whatever the other one's called, the one that doesn't have the spikes, that they're actually just variants of the same dinosaur.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:23]** It'd be the male and the female, or a juvenile versus an adult, kind of like we see in deer or something like that.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** It was a very interesting TED Talk.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:40]** The whole idea was just flipping our idea of what dinosaurs actually are and how we understand them based on the bones that we have found, which after reading Jurassic Park and understanding that none of those dinosaurs exist in the capacity that Jurassic Park showed them in, you know, in Dinosaurus Rex.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I have a question for Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:45]** I think Dimorphodons are dragons.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** Kevin, did they have feathers?

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** Did they still have feathers, or did they change that or retcon it again or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** I think feathers is still the current theory.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Yeah.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** They're more closely related to the chicken than they are a lizard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** I can see that.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** It's like horses are related to whales.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Abolitionarily.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Oh, yeah?

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** It's like land whales.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** Yeah, no, that's actually the connection.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** What the f***?

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** Whales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:19]** So a whale just showed up and then it just started slowly walking onto land and then eventually... Yeah, a whale was like, it's kind of nice up here.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** And then like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** Like, there are no giant squids I need to deal with.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:26]** Like, it's just some dimorphodons and I'll call it a day, you know?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** Will, what are you wearing, buddy?

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** You've got some good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** It's a to-be-released pattern.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** It might be a game map also, like an actual dungeon map.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** So this is a dungeon map that I'm wearing.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** That's also camouflage.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** That's also by us, by WillSafe.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** You can check it out at shop.willsafethepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:55]** I am interested actually in making some maps now and then turning them into merch.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** That's actually kind of cool.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Map to merch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:20]** yeah like that i can wear it right here you know can you like get schematics of the other cargo bay and make that into like a uh like we should absolutely i should have all the things that we were because i don't know what it looks like i would love to do that yeah that's good it's good yeah it's good speaking of maps uh maybe the journey that it took into existence

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Did it?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Oh yeah, it just popped up one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** It's been there the whole time.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** It's been there the whole time.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** It's still there if I go to Roll20.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** Speaking of maps, I want to say that... Everything else is God, but the other cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** In a future adventure, will you get to play there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** I'll be a dinosaur and play.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Only there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** You'll be a dinosaur in the other cargo bay.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:48]** Look, I want to give a big shout out and thank you to, not sure how to pronounce it, but I think it says Peku Maps and Frag Maps.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** You all are fantastic.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:57]** And I have used and am using your stuff now for this nano adventure.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:00]** This is my first ever time homebrewing anything.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** And I was like, man, I have all these cool ideas.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** I need a map.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** And I was like, where do I go?

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Boom.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** Frag Maps says Peku.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Awesome, awesome maps, as you guys will see.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Thank you very much to you all.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Yeah, they are very, very cool.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Happy to support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** Props to John for taking up the efforts to make up his own adventure.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** I think it's a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:29]** I only jammed one game ever, and it was a handful.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** And I can't imagine starting to do that from scratch, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** There's definitely a lot more of like, all right, I'm ready.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Oh, no, I'm not.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:41]** I'm not ready to go because there's this one giant thing that you forget that you think the book's going to have and the book is you.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** More dinosaurs.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** More dinosaurs.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Every adventure needs more dinosaurs.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:56]** But if there's something that you're very happy to take criticism or constructive feedback or whatever it is, I really just want you guys to have fun and maybe in some ways tie this into the story.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** That's my main goal.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** And have all you listeners have fun at the table.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** Yeah, Kelly, what is your feedback right now?

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Is it about dinosaurs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** No, although I am still going to do that.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** But I just wanted to shout out someone from Discord again.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** It's been a little bit.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** And I just wanted to say hi to Uldreon.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** I know that you're not always popping in, but you're there from time to time.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Uldreon, our French willing.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** We might have more than one, I'm supposing.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** I suppose, if you look at the map.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** But thanks for being in the Discord.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** And you're very friendly and nice to me.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** So I like nice people.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** So thanks for being cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Bonjour.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Bonjour.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Everybody else is just a guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Bonjour, mon ami.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Salut.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** What did you say?

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** They're officially French.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:39]** Everyone else is just a guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** That is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:45]** Thank you to our official French listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** He's a musician as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** All right.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Well, thanks, man.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** With that beautiful French sign-off.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** That was so nice.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** It was so pleasant.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Merci.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** It means thank you.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Merci beaucoup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Merci beaucoup, Kelly.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Is Voltaire French?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I like Voltaire.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Voltaire was French.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** 100%.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Sounds French to me.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Okay, fine.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:07]** I forgot.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** It's been a while.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** And the Marquis de Lafayette.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** We Americans owe him a great debt.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Classic.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Classic.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** And the Statue of Liberty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** Oh yeah, we did get that from the French.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** Thanks for funding the American Revolution, by the way, with us as well.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** We love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:29]** We love slaying kings in the name of freedom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** I didn't know that we had so many shout-outs today.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** This is really nice.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** This is to French people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** How come we're insulting our own states, but we're really nice to the French?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** You know what?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** The one place we won't shit on is France.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** France.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** France.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** So we have to be really nice to Louisiana by extension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** I love France.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Louisiana by extension.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Okay.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:55]** Adam, I'm sure he's got some kind of first descendancies.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Is that the right way to say it?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Descendancies?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** That's not the word.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Adam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Descendancies is the future.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Really?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Let's talk about it later.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** My first name.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:09]** You and I are probably distantly related, actually, because my first name comes from that name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** So, last episode.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Bring it back here.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** You know what?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** You all intimidated these combatants into giving up.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** Let's list the ways that you intimidated them.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** A hammer in front of their face.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** A hammer axe in front of their face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Their life flashing before their eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** Tripping them and then stepping on their chest.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:42]** Second successful maneuver against them consistently.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Impressive.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:51]** You intimidated them by wielding this giant pike and just being super intimidating coming around the corner.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** It's actually a normal sized pike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** It just looks giant.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** You intimidated them by killing their dinosaur.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Impressive.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Impressive.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** R.I.P.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** You know how you didn't intimidate them?

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** By being a linebacker sprinting at them at full speed.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** And also by calling out to them in Russian.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** The two ways in which you didn't intimidate.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** I wasn't trying to intimidate them.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** It's really unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:28]** I love the picture because as the combat encounter ends, all those mutation points go back to zero.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:35]** And so I imagine he turns the corner, the battle's over, and his Cav's just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** That's a weird mechanic.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** Like, hey, you're out of combat.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Devolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Yeah.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** It's just like Digimon.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** So you just... Digimon.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** That's good.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Yeah.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Digimon.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Digimon.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:53]** All right.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** Digimon come to battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:11]** You come out of combat and with the leader getting on her knees, hands above her head, Commander Bolt stepping over and slapping some restraints on her.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** Kara, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** I'm going to throw...

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** The book at you.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:25]** She says as she slaps on some binders onto this dude on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** She seems like a dominatrix the way that she just seems that way.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** I think you're right.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Everything about her, though.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:37]** She's like a gentle dominatrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** I'll be right back for you.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** And then she just like softens her lip.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Don't go anywhere.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yeah, that's what she does.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** She literally... She does.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Whip yourself, remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:55]** The security guard chases after the one who was running and in a few minutes comes and brings them back.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:59]** The room starts to fill up a little bit more as the tension, you can feel it ease.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:06]** The sun and the golden rays of the sun, the last sunlight, are still...

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:35]** bringing some warmth in the room and maybe you all start to realize how warm even this huge volume of space this is you're breathing pretty hard because out of nowhere you had to jump to action and you did you did successfully get these people uh you know calmed capture them and kill a dinosaur in the process and destroy priceless worth of fossils and floor that are part of

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:45]** Now, it's at this time that Commander Bolt steps closer to where the bar is, reaches over, grabs a couple shot glasses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Come on over, Kara.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Bingo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Boom.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Tiso, come on.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** Starts to pour you all a shot.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:00]** If you would like it or anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** You might be surprised, but I don't drink even vodka.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** But I appreciate the gesture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Whatever you'd like.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** Not while I'm on duty.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Of course.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Whatever you'd like.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Just takes kind of like a sip.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Doesn't shoot it.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** But just takes kind of a sip.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Migo shoots it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** Cecil will join, and he'll take it.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** You can pour something else.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Yeah, pour like a soda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:28]** Boom takes out like a little satchel and then like opens it up and sips it open.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:31]** And there's like an array of cigars if anyone wants them.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Anyone care for a smoke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** I'm okay.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** Look, we might be kind of quick here, but if you can enjoy that, you should definitely enjoy it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** I always do.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** More people have started to come into the space.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Obviously, there are some museum admins.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:54]** There are some more security who come in, starting to corral the assailants.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** They're starting to walk them out.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:05]** And it's during this time that Commander Bolt looks down, reads something on their data pad, kind of nods her head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Thank you all.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** That was impressive.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** But I shouldn't have expected anything less.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** You all did a great job suppressing them.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** So, once again, just gonna cheers you on that.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** But the real work is still ahead of us.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:33]** Look, as I've been worried about, we just received the signal of an emergency beacon from inside the new Ringworks offices building.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** And...

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** attached residence.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** I'm thinking it's Leora.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** She was coming to us live from her new office.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Seems like she's in trouble.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** I think she's in trouble.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** There's definite reason to believe that it's her.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** It's probably most likely a trap.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** It could be a trap.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** I agree with Milf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:03]** The thing is... The thing is... I am worried...

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:11]** Given some of the patterns from your previous abductions, you want to keep your eyes out.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** I'll brief you more as we're getting into the dropship.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** I've called the dropship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** It is outfitted with your gear.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** You do realize you're going to need to go in and extract your safely from these bizarre cultists.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** So we only have kind of looks back out at the sun, checks for data pad.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:31]** Maybe one and a half, two hours until the sunset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** So we got to get moving quickly.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** I can brief you on this ship.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Any questions before we get going here?

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:43]** These folks right here, they're going to go over to HQ for questioning.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:46]** I'm thinking maybe we can get something out of them quickly here.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Try and understand what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** Can we get a little more information out of that one right there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** The one that surrendered themselves?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Yeah, they all surrendered themselves.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** This one right here that was next to the bolt.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** The Kinkara one.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** We know it's Kinkara.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** I'm very confused on the name.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** What is your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** Look.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:16]** I'm happy to have you question them now, but I'm a little more concerned about you getting to the Rinkworks offices before something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** I think radio has any information on the way.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Yeah, don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:29]** Cecil looks at the other three of the unit and is like, if we're going in blind, they might know something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** I agree.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** We should ask them as much information as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:36]** I'm sure they're just going to try and toy with our minds.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** See what you can get out of them, chief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Yeah, don't worry.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** Look, I'm going to be following y'all along the way, feeding you info as we get it live.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Wow.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Thanks, Jeff.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:54]** Man, the paranoia of threefold, its reach is far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** No, for real.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Like, I was just thinking that.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** I'm like, I'm not going to trust anyone.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** It's all because of threefold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** No one trusts anyone.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** I know.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:15]** One thing that you do notice as they are walking out, and Carl, you would have noticed this too, is that there is a logo that is on their armor.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** They spent the time.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** to come up with a logo.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** Uh, you can go ahead and roll and give me a culture check.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** All of you can, if you'd like, because you would have seen it.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** I'm going to, I'm going to share it with you now.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:32]** I think I would have uncultured swine bonus.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Maybe.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** 23.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Wow.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:39]** You should either see it on your screen or if you go in your journal, you'll see the logo.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** What the hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** I'm doing it for the visual people anyways.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** It's a circle with a... I forget the term.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** It's a... Cord.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Cord.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Yes.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Thank you.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:55]** There's a cord that would just north of...

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:22]** the center point and then there are two other lines from that chord coming down as a fan almost and the two two that come down are a different color they're purple instead of black everything else is black so I think I'm like almost impossible to fail this so let's see car let me know what you got in a second boom you got a 23 30 yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** 30 from Cara.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:28]** And if it's a sense motive, it's not a sense motive, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** No, it's not.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** So earlier when I did a sense motive, though, the DC should be five less because of my theme knowledge.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** What's your theme knowledge?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** It's law officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Law officer.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:47]** I got a 14, but it should be five easier for anything related to militaries.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Rad.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** And Cecil, you're just taking your shot.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Just chilling.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Just being sus.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** He doesn't know shit.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Okay, cool.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Love it.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Literally, he's not training culture.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** That's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Just sitting there sipping his whiskey.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** What do you do?

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Do you live under a rock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** I mean, that shot is like a giant glass to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** It's like a pint glass.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** He did live under a rock.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** He lived under two giant rocks.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** He lived in the bottom of Mara his entire life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Oh, that's why.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** That's why.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** You grew up in lower levels.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** I did, too, but I left quite early.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Why do you talk like a Russian, then?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:30]** Well, I was taken over by Space Nation.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** That's how I escaped the lower levels.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** That's how I escaped the lower levels.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:41]** But if I remove voice modifier, you and I can talk in our native tongue.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** But I like how I sound now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:54]** You took, like, a Russian learn Akatonian, like, YouTube course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** It was taught by a Russian.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** That's how you learned it.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** They came along and they're like, oh, come here, little mouse.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** And they took me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:11]** The only thing that I know about this that I sort of recognize is that this logo here is the logo for the integrated future front.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** Cara, you have heard of the integrated future front.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:22]** Maybe you've had a little skirmish or run in on the street in the bar.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Nothing of this caliber.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** The integrated future.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** I would know where they hang out.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Hear this out.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** The integrated future manifesto.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:51]** you know, Cara, is like this multimedia omnibus compendium that was supposedly put together by the founders whose peace ritual, spellcasting ritual, went awry.

**[00:26:52 - 00:27:04]** And they were briefly given a vision of an alternate utopia, an alternate reality where there was devoid or that was devoid of hunger, war, strife, suffering.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:08]** And then they came back and said, I know how to get there.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:15]** And they put down what that world looks like, what that reality looks like, all that knowledge.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:24]** And over time, obviously, people have started to maybe put in some... Trying to adhere to it, to bring it about.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:30]** Well, over time, some more conspiracy theorists have added on to the original work.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Some of it's a little more such.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:37]** Typically, you see and have heard about them on the street.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:49]** They're hawking wares, have a megaphone, trying to advocate that this park needs to disappear or that this building needs to face the other way.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Minor things like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Social irritant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Yeah.

**[00:27:53 - 00:28:08]** But you do know that there is the propensity, the potential that maybe they say, well, this leader has been assassinated and we're going to do that and we're going to actualize this reality.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** So they can be dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:14]** And it changed about through the blood of martyrs.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** These abolition.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** What was their name again?

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** The integrated future front.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** They're decentralized.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** They're decentralized.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** So it doesn't quite fit that they would have one place to hang out.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** But there are more local and regional.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** There are cells that exist all over the packed worlds.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** Otherwise relegated to fringe theory.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:47]** And it makes sense when you maybe think about what it was that the voice shouted and that they all shouted together.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** The perfect future demands payment.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** Leora Huxley will die with the last light of the sun.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** The stars will pay with a life.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** The gate will be satisfied.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** And they all said, for tomorrow I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** We've got to stop whatever they've got planned, guys.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Goddamn fanaticals.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** Always getting in the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:17]** Are these related to everything we've been doing for the last year?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:18]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Are they even organized enough to do that?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** I don't think.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:33]** You would remember that, again, of the perpetrators that you've caught in these previous handful of abductions, they've all been from different gangs.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:44]** And if you remember, Amaro does have a pretty healthy range of gangs that are integrated into life even so seamlessly as there are many that are very charitable gangs.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:49]** as a way to bring in new members and do an actual lot of good.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:55]** And then on the other side of the spectrum, there are some that are more nefarious, let's say.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** So with that, the IFF...

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** has never been one of the gangs that you've seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** Well, a new type of gang to meet and destroy.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** They sure know how to make an entrance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** That they certainly do.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** New gang, old gang.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** It's all the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** Let's go to work, guys.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Let's load up.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:31]** Commander Bolt leads you out to the, if you can picture in your mind, this beautiful port.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:44]** where this incredibly, let's say, out-of-place ship, because of its tactical nature, it looks like a copter with these blown-out rotund sides that allow for a lot more storage.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:57]** And it is landing as you all step out and push out of the double doors, maybe shielding your eyes against the Akatonian sunset as the sunlight hits these doors for the last time for a month.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** And you all are just able to make out the shadow...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:22]** of the ship coming down cecil guys i'll i'm gonna be a minute all right hurry up hurry up and he kind of ducks over and you know it hits the private mode and puts his hand up

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:27]** So it's just him and his ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** Just him in his ear, just like chilling.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Just like, hey, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Privately.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Yeah.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** He's got a finger like this for a microphone, and he's got this other finger in his ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** It's just him holding his fingers like this.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:39]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** He's like this.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** That's so cool.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Bob's phones once were shaped this way.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Yeah, they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:49]** So you pick it up, and as soon as you pick it up, you hear...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** The signal, the signal is back.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** The signal is back.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** The signal is back.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** The signal is back.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Hey, sweetie.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** How are you?

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Sorry.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** What's going on?

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** That was Tonem.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** No, that was Tonem.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** They're just going on about something with this.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** Turn that down, would you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** It's just one of his games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** No, it's that signal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** It's loud.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** Turn it down.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** How is the event?

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** I wasn't going to call you, but Tonem grabbed my phone.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:25]** Sorry to bother, babe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Look, babe.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** It got a little rough.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Something happened.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** I can't really talk about it.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** You know how that goes.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:33]** We're being assigned something else.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** It's happening real fast.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I can't.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** But I promise, babe, I'll be home tonight.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** I'll see you later, okay, babe?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** I love you.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Okay.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** All right.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** I love you.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Say hi to Babies.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Babies.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Oh, sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** All right.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Kiss the kids.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** Be safe.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** You know I love them, too.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Come home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** The signal!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** The signal is back!

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Okay.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** All right.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** I'm going to go.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** Love you.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** Bye.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Bye.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Love you, too.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** It's just like real life, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Kevin does this frequently.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** It's cute.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** It's good.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** It's a good thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** That signal.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Oh, my God.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** That signal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:23]** That's the sound of the blades of the drop ship as it is coming more towards an idle for everyone to get on board.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** What are you all thinking?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:30]** I'm going to bring you over now to the inside of the copter.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** What are you all thinking as you step in?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:39]** And as you walk in, you can see that the lights of Morrow down below.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** You're so close to the edge below.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** The lights have started to already come up.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** You can see that the sun is eagerly headed towards the horizon.

**[00:33:47 - 00:34:03]** And as we kind of zoom back, we can see that the two pilots sitting up front that are about to be en route, the inside dark metal, furnished, tactical, low ceiling lockers above each individual seat.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** They're deep because of the sides of the drop ship.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:13]** There's a lot of room for activities and fun things in there and all of the kit that I put into your bag that we'll get into in just a second.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:19]** And in the middle, you can see the drop mechanism both on the floor and on the ceiling releasing the ropes.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:30]** The inside is covered in tech gear as the four of you are starting to make your way as the ship lifts off and you start changing.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** What are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** This is like a... For you audio listeners.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** It's like a halo.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** It looks like...

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:54]** It looks like a duty issue compartment with restraints and safety harnesses for flight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** You got the running lights so that way you know where to step.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:02]** You can see the crease on the floor where the floor will drop out.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Yeah, it's a drop ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** It reminds me of the ones from Halo, sort of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** It kind of reminds me of Starship Troopers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Yeah, that too, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:17]** To me, it's the Pelican from Halo if it was in Mass Effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Yeah, yeah, for sure.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** It does have that aesthetic.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Mass Effect feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:27]** You all would know that this ship can do different types of drops.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:35]** You live in a vertical city, so being able to move in and out of small spaces and at any time being able to pivot...

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** And having multi, it can hover, it can float.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** It has nacelles that will bend forward, bend up.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** The rotors can stop.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** You can drop either just from your seat.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** There's a tail door that can come down.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** I'm probably saying that's the incorrect term for it, that you can leap out of.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:58]** You know that in this case, it's likely that you'll drop down on ropes from where you're going to go.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** But you might get that more as we keep going.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** What are you all thinking stepping in?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** Maybe this is your second or third time.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** Maybe one of you has had more experience in these shifts before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** Yeah, I think Cecil is the most junior person on this team.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:21]** He's only been on... Actually, he's only joined since they started dealing with all the things that they were being recognized for in that event.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:25]** And so he's been on a few raids, but like...

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** This is new to him.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** He's trained, but this is probably his first time jumping out of a jump ship.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** And on top of that, he's nervous about his family.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** He loves his family, and he just wants to be home with them every night.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** And the idea of keeping them safe is the reason he stays in this job.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** So it's a little nerve-wracking, a little double-edged sword there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:49]** Boom is fairly senior, and so he can sense the discomfort on Cecil.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:54]** And as he's lighting his next cigar, he takes a puff and looks over.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** He's like, Cecil, are you feeling okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:01]** Yeah, I'm just a little... It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Let's just do it.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** You'll be fine, and you'll get back to your wife and child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** No problem.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** We've done this many times.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** It will be no different.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:16]** And you have us more experienced comrades with you to help you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** You'll be all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** I think he finds, like, your calm demeanor a little uneasy.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** That's a little unsettling about how calm you're about.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:36]** I mean, when you, like, are raised in the U-S-S-S-R, the, you know, space, Soviet space states, whatever the fuck.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Or as we like to call it, the C-C-C.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:41]** I thought you said you were raised in Borough.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** C-P.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:47]** Well, for a while, and then... I have seen some s**t, Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Do not worry.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** He gives you a saucy wink and continues to smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Saucy wink.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Saucy wink.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** What about Migo and Kara?

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** You thinking?

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** You talking?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** What's happening?

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:06]** You've got a couple minutes before you're going to get prep.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Commander Bolt's still getting back to where they need to be.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:15]** You've still got a good amount of time before you get across the city, down the trench, to the Ringworks office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Okay.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:24]** I think Migo, seeing this exchange, probably walks over and sits next to Cecil.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:32]** Or, well, I don't know if Boom is still there, but he sort of walks over and wedges himself between the two of them.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** Because Migo is kind of awkward.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Huge frame.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Like that, yeah.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Oh, excuse me.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Come on, Migo.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** There's always room for Migo.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Duh, comrade.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Very good.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Much improvement from last week.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** I've done this a few dozen, maybe a few hundred, I don't even know.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** A bunch of times.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** I'll tell you, it doesn't get easy.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:13]** Things might get dicey, but hey, the worst, if they knock you down, we'll be sure to bring your body back and you'll be

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** You'll be just fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Come on, man.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:22]** You literally undid all of the good work that I just accomplished like 30 seconds ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** I'm talking to the mouse.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** He's going to be fine.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** We'll bring it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** You will be fine.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** We will not be carrying your dead body back.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** We'll carry you alive on top of our shoulders in victory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** Yeah, what he said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Sakara!

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** What's the plan here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:46 - 00:40:02]** Kara, this whole time, in this brief moment that she's got, she's interrupted from flipping through her comm device, looking at all the limited intel that she can pull up on people from the IFF or the IF.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Sliding through like...

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** What is it?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:21]** She's got this sort of, like, calm demeanor, but she's pumped because she's, like, she feels empowered being in this vehicle and being, like, leading the team.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:25]** Like, she's about to bring some heat down on somebody.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Like, she's stoked.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** This is what she's trained for.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Yeah.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** She's, like, she relishes the opportunity to, like...

**[00:40:35 - 00:41:00]** bring it and i think at this point like cara is the leader of the four yeah right like i think so she's the local she that like that's part of why she uh is so like jacked because she's like i'm the one in this from here to do this yeah she's she's also like jack she's i don't know what you mean by that but yeah she's a muscle mummy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Muscle.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Muscle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It's personal for her.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** It makes sense she's a leader.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** It's personal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:31]** it's her neighborhood and the things that she grew up with and so that's true being in this like you know drop ship is like i'm a badass i'm gonna bring it this is my town like i feel like you probably watched some of these military tactical helicopters as a kid overhead as a kid yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:53]** looking so for you through the from the bowels of mara yeah right when the sky is just a sliver of light sorry my god does car take some of these like more aggressive actions from local gangs personally like is that a little bit yeah yeah um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:59]** She has a history that goes a lot of pain and anger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** Cecil, you should know that Kara is also very, very familiar with this area.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** So that should also give you confidence.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** She grew up here whole time.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** Unlike you who grew up in dirty bottom water area.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** She grew everywhere.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** She's been everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** All right.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Thanks, boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Yeah.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Just stay close.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** Well, I'll, uh, I'll make sure we get you out.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** And like, he goes to wink, but he can't like quite decide which eye to wink with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:35]** And so it's like, you leave pepped up to other people.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Okay.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:43]** Does one eye like spontaneously grow larger or like grow more feline, you know, and like you get a third eyelid just spontaneously.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Where's Remy from?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** Remy's from Mara.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Oh.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** Well, he grew up somewhere else, but somewhere around Akaton.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** I think it's Ara.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** I can't remember back to my backstory.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:00]** But he moved to Mara with his family because his wife is from that area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Got it.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** So he's like the outsider, but like...

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Moved.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Like transplant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** Transplant, but been here for a decade or more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Practically a local.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** But not quite a local.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Not quite a local.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** Not quite has the accent yet, because apparently everybody talks like a Russian.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** Because it's the former.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** I can't do a female.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** I mean, I can barely do a Russian voice.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** I don't think I can try and do a female Russian voice.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** I'm sorry, Kyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** You do a good female voice, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Thank you.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** Why are you...

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:47]** Kara, as you're going through your comms, getting limited info, just refreshing yourself on Ringworks Industries, maybe looking at some of the proposals and things that went through for this office, right?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:53]** Like what used to be in its place, different designs, trying to familiarize yourself with it.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** As you're going through scrolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** History of the building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** History of the building.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** We'll get to that.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Keep that thought.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Pin it.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:09]** There's a notification that comes down, and it's from your mom.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** She sent you a message.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Just as hey.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Just as hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Tommy Mommy Squared.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** I want to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Tommy Mommy Squared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** She's going to say, hi, what's up?

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** What's new?

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** You see the three dots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** And then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:57]** they disappear and then they come back and says nothing never mind um okay car is gonna be like you can um you can tell me what's wrong i won't i'm not gonna i'm not here to to judge okay so like a so like a really like reaching out olive branch kind of message like yeah yeah

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:01]** You're like, is everything okay?

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:05]** There's like a couple dots come up again.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** And then you see a message that says, I hope so.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** Thank you.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** And then there's like a little heart emoji.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** I'm going to react to the heart with a heart.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** And right when that happens, there's the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Hey, everybody.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** All right.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** I am online.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** This is Commander Bolt.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** I am online and ready to go.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** How are we doing here in the ship?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** How are we feeling?

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Feeling okay today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** We're ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Is there any?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Okay.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Okay.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** All right.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** I got it.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Didn't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:47]** Checked all of her weapons and freshened up all of her gear.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** Love it.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** All right.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Look.

**[00:45:50 - 00:46:00]** Tightening straps and then checks on Remy to make sure there's no liquid trickling down his leg or whatever.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Still dry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Still dry.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:09]** Look, I gave you a refresh of your kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:16]** We got a little bit after fun, some slop in the budget this year, so I upped a few of your weapons.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:23]** I have given you in Hero Lab, which is why you're over-encumbered, a choice of three different long arms.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** You can choose from adding.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:32]** This is on top of the kit that you already had and bought for yourself, which I would assume is part of your own personal expense, everything else, your specialties, right?

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:41]** You have been given a choice of a staccato pulse rifle, a utility breaching gun, or an azimuth laser rifle to bring in as much as you want as well.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:47]** For small arms, you have a choice of a flash compliance ray, which is non-lethal, or an azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:52]** Now, I think only one of you has a heavy armor.

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:04]** You meet the prerequisites of proficiency, and you have the option in your locker for a squad Defiance series heavy armor.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Boom is doing that right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** Boom is putting it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Boom is putting that on.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Cool.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:17]** And then the light armor proficiency flavor people, there's a Vesk Brigadine II armor for you.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** In each of these armors, there have been upgrades.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** One is a light projector.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:29]** The other is an auto CPR module in order to stabilize you and give you a bonus to a medical check if you go down.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** Now, your kit, real quick.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** I'll just run through it.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** If there's anything that looks cool to you, you can read out the description.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** And if there's anything you want to pause on, we can read it.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** But I'll just be very quick.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** In your gear kit, you have a secret slime.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:47]** You have a tier one antitoxin.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** You have a mark one healing serum.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** You have a close quarters serum.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** You have a mark three breaching charge, which can get through a steel door.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** That's like no joke.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** You have a sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:13]** an EnviroMask, a laser drill, an all-purpose accessory, a jammer charge, binding restraints, a portable flashlight, an emergency beacon, and phase rods, which are my favorite.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** I also have the Seeker Slime.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** And Seeker Slime.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Yes.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** Or as Snakeboy would say, Seeker Slime.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** Cecil, you had your hand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** I was going to say, those phase rods are my favorite.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:36]** As a former rock climber, the idea of just being able to... It's almost like ice picks, but they phase into the material and then unphase, so they're part of the material.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:55]** yeah you can like manually phase it or unphase it yeah yeah apparently you can it it also will fuse with bone apparently with as a weapon it's cool that's pretty rad i could see that being a little torturous though unless i'm not seeing it i don't think i have the phase rods


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Oh, you should.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Okay.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** They're like a hybrid item.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Yeah, they're a hybrid item.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** I was going quick, so I might have just missed it.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** But feel free to add them, or I can add them after this.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Okay.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Okay.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Love it.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** All right.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:13]** So you might see some cool things there, including the phase rods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** I'm really into those.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** They're very cool.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** So, sorry.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Just had something in my throat there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Hope you all are strapped in and ready to go.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** You will be dropping via a rappel here.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** There will not be a surface for you to push off of.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** You will be dropping down the ship.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:36]** Now, we again did get an emergency beacon signal from inside the offices.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:44]** I think the quickest path from looking at the plans are going to be to airdrop you onto the mechanical roof of

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:49]** that is adjacent to the entry floor for Leora's office.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** You'll need to follow that beacon in order to find her.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:59]** We'll have more, let's call it resolution, once you are there inside, okay?

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** I will say that you will have Archie with you as well.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:10]** So you will be able to communicate with me and I will be able to see and hear some of what is going on there.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:18]** So with Archie there, we will be able to provide some more resolution about where that beacon is going and probably the quickest path to get there.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:27]** Archie is the aggregate reconnaissance communication hover interface, who is essentially a drone hanging out with you to help be your eyes and ears.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:37]** So that way, as one, another communication relay, so that way communication stays through, even if you're going deep into the cliff or provide more video and audio.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** That's cool.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** They're pretty cool.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Yeah, they're a cool little thing.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:45]** So one thing I'll say, you may have to go into the residence as well.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Keep that in mind.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Be open.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** I also want to say,

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:54]** We can't rule out the integrated futures front's responsibility in any of these.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** The patterns are similar, okay?

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** Emergency beacon, you all are moving in.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** That's pretty typical for the start of these scenarios.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** So I need you to keep your eyes and ears out.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** We have...

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** T-minus 92 minutes until sundown.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** We're told that sundown is when Leora is going to die.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:22]** So I'm going to need you to be quick and efficient, but keep those eyes and ears open for any information, anything that might be able to provide some sort of clue here that we might not have.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:25]** Her office, probably a good place to start.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** That's where she was kidnapped, if you can make your way there first.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:32]** But again, I'll be with you through Archie, and obviously I trust your experience.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** I'll be on comms.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** Any questions?

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** Before I brief you.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Weapons free.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Okay.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Wait, what does weapons free mean?

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Shoot people.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Cool.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Love it.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** And then at that point, there's a projector that comes down that's in front of each of you.

**[00:51:51 - 00:52:00]** And that it's like this dry statistical information about the Ringworks offices, how they are officially open as of yesterday.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** That part of the office, the actual factory is not open.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:10]** It's a facility that is part of a historic building that has been many things over the years.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** And Ringworks has only moved in over the past year.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Contractors were quick, but they are still working on parts of the building.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Yeah.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:30]** You get some information on Leora Huxley, Hilkey, age 40, standing approximately 5'9", approximately 140 pounds, blonde hair, last seen wearing formal red-purple Aquatonian armor.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** Any other questions before we drop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Do we have a lock?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Hey, do we have a lock on that beacon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** We do have a pretty solid lock on the beacon.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:58]** Remember that emergency beacons, once they are activated, and you all have one, emergency beacons, I think they're good for an insane number of miles that you can track the signal from.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** It is...

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:07]** 100 miles over flat terrain, halved in forests and hills, quartered in mountainous terrains and underwater.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:14]** So, you know, it's at least 25 miles that you can get a pretty solid lock on it.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:18]** You can also lock it up to or you can sync it up.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:22]** You can sync lock it with like a Starship or vehicles comm systems as well.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** So they're a pretty great GPS finding tool.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** So, yeah, you do have a pretty solid lock on that right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Love it.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:35]** Any scans of the building to see how many bogeys we might have to dispatch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** No, we don't have any scans.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:43]** I'll do my best as we're going through using Archie, but we don't have any scans right now at the moment.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Any other questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** What's our access point?

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:49]** Supposedly we're going in the back door as it were or something like this, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Sort of.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:58]** My understanding is that the mechanical roof has a tiered level of systems behind the large ringwork sign in front.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** And then there is a lot of mechanical units up front.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:07]** It appears to be two doors, one to a private office suite and one unmarked on the other side.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** That's all that we know.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** My understanding is that this is also the C-level suite.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:18]** The offices do extend above and below and the residence extends further around the corner.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:28]** And as she says that, you can start to see in the distance the large ring and R logo that is in front of the building.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** And you can see that it's facing the setting sun.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** And then the building extends below and above.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** It's pretty close to the top of the trench, though.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** It's like very highly valued property.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:42]** And then the cliff actually turns and rings around.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:46]** And you can see off to the right, you can see some of the residents there.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** You can see a small garden area.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:53]** Also has sunlight and is able to see the beautiful view.

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:01]** And that's been where your understanding of Leora Huxley has been staying during the construction to oversee and make sure that everything came up well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:06]** It says it takes an engineering check to determine the location of the emergency beacon.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:13]** So if we roll an engineering check, would we know if she's in the residency or the office?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:21]** I mean, I think right now as you're starting to, like, that's if you did it without any support from Archie or from Commander Bolt, right?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** So you have people running that in the background.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Okay.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:28]** Yeah, but that is good to know in case, one, you need to use your own.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** Bless you.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:35]** Or two, if you want to get more resolution because Archie has lost signal, maybe Archie goes down.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:39]** Whatever happens, you will also be able to get access to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** Cecil is new and not used to all the support that we have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** You will learn a lot with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** We love him anyway.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** He's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** He's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** I trust you all with my life, and I'm trusting you with Leora's life.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** So let's get out there and do what you do best.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** All right?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Ready.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Let's get this job done.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:07]** You start to...

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:15]** come up and the copter comes up and you see before you, like I said, you see the large ring R and a ring around it.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:21]** And you see this roof, the sun paints a beautiful picture of these new offices.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:25]** And you're able to see that for the most part, uh,

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** There is not much on the roof.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** There's a pretty good landing area.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:39]** The best area to land right now is probably going to be landing right in front of or on the rafters that come up that allow access to there.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** There are windows on the right side.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** And then on the left side, it's a solid wall.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** You all ready?

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Are you ready?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** All right, let's go to work.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Boom, you got the breacher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** I always have breach in charge.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Let's do this.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** In fact, I have many of them.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** In fact, I have many.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Amazing.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:06]** Name your explosive, I have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** What do you need from me?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:19]** I want you guys to picture that you all are coming over and you feel the... And you realize that this might be the highest up that you've ever been.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** I mean, maybe for some jobs, you've been up and beyond.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** But, you know, you've obviously left Morrow.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** But in terms of just being on Morrow, this could be one of the highest points.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Cecil's probably never been that high, that's for sure.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** So rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** So it's like, I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:38]** The bottom of the ship by your feet swings down.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:49]** And you're able to see directly below you the sunlight painting the roof in this beautiful yellow and orange hue.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:57]** And then... And these four ropes drop down, hanging from the center of the vehicle.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:01]** And you are able to rappel down onto the roof.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:09]** And I am going to need everyone to go ahead and give me an athletics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Will, what's up?

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Nothing.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** I was just going to roll my dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** Okay.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** I need you to give me an athletics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Does it have to be athletics?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** It can't be acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** It is athletics.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:31]** I have already, I will tell you, I have already put in some contingencies for what the DC is based on your training, based on the weather and other scenarios.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** Okay.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** Okay.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Okay.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** So, uh, sorry.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Migo got an 11, uh,

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Boom got an 18.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Kara got a 16.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** A 16.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** Okay.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** And Cecil got an 8.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** Cecil is new.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** I love when the dice tell the story.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Of course, Cecil.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:56]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** It's so good.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** Goodbye, wife and kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** It's so good.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Goodbye.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:00]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** He dies on impact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** The Migo was right.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:18]** It's perfect because the two most experienced people nailed it and just got a great, great role.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** So, Kara.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Boom.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:29]** What are you doing as you step up, put your feet, wrap one foot around the rope, whatever you're going to do in order to grab the technique to slide down the rope.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Yeah.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:37]** She's got her rifle in her hand as she's looking down and she just sort of like slides down.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Just starts to go down.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Okay.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Like John Wick.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05
