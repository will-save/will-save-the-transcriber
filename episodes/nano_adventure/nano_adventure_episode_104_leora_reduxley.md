## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:28]** Music Music Music Music Music


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** That's the worst song ever.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:20]** I want that song.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** No, that song also sucks.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:23]** Or the song that no one can f*** to.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** No.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** This sounds like a reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Are we talking about Nickelback again?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Welcome to Listen to My Game!

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:32]** We'll see!

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:32]** We'll see!

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** What is this tropical music?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** I am your f***ing GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** And we're going to try it again to keep it tight.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** We're going to try it one more time.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** One more time.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Keep it tight.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** Okay, guys.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** This is round two of keeping it tight.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:48]** You have one thing that you get to say and we're just going to say it and there's just no response.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** And you... There's no point then.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:55]** Because I just want... Okay, we'll get one response from everybody.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** That's it.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** So...

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Somebody better think of something right now.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Can you give an example, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** You guys remember the time that John rationed out responses?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** Yeah.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** It was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** Yeah, I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:07]** We're all just going to be like, and my response is, eh.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Is there like a word count?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** No, there's not a word count.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** There's not a word count.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Okay.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** This is all fast and loose.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Come on.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** No, it's tight, apparently.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** How is it fast and loose?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** Does anyone have anything that they want to say?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** That's my question.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** Is there something burning on your mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** He spammed the notes page about 18 times in the chat.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Yeah, he did do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** I want some assistance on taking f***ing notes.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** I have an excuse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** My computer's really slow today.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Sorry.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Someone else help Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:39]** I've been told that my typing is too loud for recording.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** And that's why I don't take notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:46]** You just bought like a mechanical keyboard just so you didn't have to take notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:50]** I literally have the same keyboard always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** I would be surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** I think it's actually because it moves my desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** I could see Will with two mechanical keyboards just like beating on them side by side.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** I have a typewriter.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** He's typing with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:07]** I have an Underwood 4 that I've hooked up as a USB keyboard.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** It has Bluetooth, too.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** There's a conversion kit.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Just let me get it out for you.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** As long as it goes... Or whatever the noise is there.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** Reset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** I mean, I got the electric one.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** It actually has like a hum.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** It's so loud.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Does it ding too?

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Is it a humdinger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Yeah.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** Oh, it's on there.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:38]** It can be mayor in a Paw Patrol town and do evil things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Pound puppies.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** That's the name of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** It can pound puppies in the pavement.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** There it is.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** That's the episode we get canceled on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Let's pound puppies into pavement.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** These are the dangers of not keeping it tight.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Let's just get into playing.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I really want to play.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Wait, there's not a question of the day?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** No, because I want to get into playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** You fake to say what they wanted to say.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** He knew we were going to distract from the banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** I said we could talk about one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** He distracted us.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:22]** He did the Mott and Bailey, and that's what you've got to look out for, and that's... Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** That's what I'm looking at every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** I'm confused.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** We're going to start.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** There's no question, because I want to get into playing.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** I want to get into what happens in this combat.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Kev sounds so excited right now to get into this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Thank you, Kev.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** I'm not.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:41]** There's a demon ghost dog behind me whispering in my ear.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Talking to your brain.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** He's whispering in my mind.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** And Leora disappeared.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** She's Leora Fluxly.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** That's the best one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** That is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** I like that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** I was trying to work in, like, a flux capacitor joke at some point.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** That's good.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** And then pull that one.

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** But, yeah.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** That's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** John, you beat us to it.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:05]** This is pretty Ghostbusters-y, I guess, the scenario that we're in right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:11]** And he didn't give us proton packs in our jump bags.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** I gave you a lot of things, though.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** I did give you a lot of things to improvise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** He did give us those... Phase rods?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:34]** phase rods which i was going to try and pin huxley down to the floor with but she'd be leora stuxley how long will this go on i'm excited i'm excited thank you for this

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:50]** Look, last time you guys were caught up in the middle of fighting against Leora and you crowded around her as Boom threw this lightning elemental, trying to attack her, deal some damage.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:56]** Kara and the lightning elemental were able to get through as she cast an invisibility spell.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:02]** And Kara and the lightning elemental were able to deal some damage to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** So she did cast an invisibility spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** She went invisible.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** What's the spell?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** That's what you could assume.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Okay.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** If you want to know more, you can try a new mysticism check, but the moment's kind of passed.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Because there's more to come.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:33]** As this happens, it is the top of round two, and the gate comes on and begins almost like sucking in pieces of this reality and parts of the drift as this white light appears in the aperture.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:37]** And then you also all feel this urge to walk into the gate.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** There's something about your bodies that feels like you want to move there.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:45]** We'll get into that in a minute, because at the same time, this smoky...

**[00:06:45 - 00:07:02]** vapor starts to come out of the right angle between the console and the floor filling up the space and out steps this hound this smoky smoky hound I'll bring you guys back to the map

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** And it is that hound's turn.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** And we got some new music because we're at a new stage of combat here.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** This final fight.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** I'm digging this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** Yeah, it sounds like SNES music or something.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** It's like something out of Castlevania.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Love it.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:20]** So I'm going to need Cecil.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** I'm going to need you to give me a fortitude save.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** I really want you to pass this fortitude save.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Think of your family.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** My fortitude is actually pretty good.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:55]** probably gonna be all right my dice roll is not uh it's a total 11 total 11 okay it's a fail it's definitely a fail you feel your mind start to start to split as if half of what you're seeing out of your right eye is the normal world and half of what you're seeing out of your left eye is that is like the drift and your brain can't comprehend either of those and you take 20 points of damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** What?

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** 20 points?

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** That's a lot.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** For like a minor piece.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** What?

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** That's all my stamina in one go.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** Well, it's all my remaining stamina in one go.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** I think we are outmatched.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Cecil.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** That's... So.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:13]** That's no joke.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** And with that, the creature...

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:25]** In your mind, Cecil, the creature has already said to you that your misstep will be your death.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** And then it just... Where is it?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Here it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Sorry, was that a spell?

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** Oh, no, we already took our attacks of opportunity, though, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:40]** No, this is a new round, so you could, in this round, if you want to, do that.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** So was that a spell?

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** I thought Leora was at the top of the round.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** Yeah, we're already past that.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** So then Leora disappearing would have been all of our attack opportunities now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Ooh, good luck.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Yeah, that was it.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** That wasn't a spell.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:08]** But what it does do is it just... And it becomes like a straight line that moves along the bottom of the console and teleports to the other side of you, Cecil.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** It doesn't even try to move through you.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** It just teleports.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** That's going to be its turn.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** Let's see what the Yosuke is doing.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** They keep working on something.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** They're working on something up there.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** What are you guys going to do?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Kara Valtara, it is your turn.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Let me move back.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** There you go.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Kara Valtara, it's your turn.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Where is this Yosuke?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** There's a Yosuke up on the platform to the north.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** There's a set of stairs that lead up to it.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:42]** And you recall that Leora signaled something.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:47]** Right when you all were about to, I think, get into it or combat might have just started.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** She signals something.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** Kara, before you do anything, I need you to give me a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** I don't like this.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** I don't like this at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** You think for a minute that you want to start walking to wherever you want to walk to.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** And your brain's like, all right, let's go there.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:17]** And you're just about to, and something in your body says, let's go towards the gate.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** And you now have to spend half of your speed moving towards the gate.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** Okay.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** So your speed is probably 30 feet.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** So 15 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** So I can only move 15 feet in the opposite direction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Right.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:36]** So you can either just move 15 feet back and move 15 feet forward.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** You can be where you're at now.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** Or you move 15 feet back and you can move 15 feet wherever you want.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** But you have to move 15 feet towards the gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Oh, I have to move 15 feet towards the gate.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** Yeah.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Half your speed.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Okay.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** Yeah.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** So, uh, I will, I'm going to move.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** There's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Yeah.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Sorry.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Yeah.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:59]** So as, as she's like feeling this, I guess she's like fighting her body.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Yeah.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** You're, like, stepping backwards and forwards.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** She's struggling, kind of, like, lurching forward.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:16]** And so as she does that, she's going to try and, like... Is there a railing here or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:20]** Yeah, like, where you just stepped onto on the map is kind of these, like...

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:36]** heat exchangers that you can kind of squeeze into that space so there's not a railing there there's just uh there's just these heat exchangers that are about three feet up so there's not a railing there she's like in between the heat exchangers yeah yeah yeah you can still move through them it's fine okay yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:12:01]** um so she's gonna come up to the edge of those uh heat exchangers as she's fighting and then she's gonna like sort of activate she's trying to brace herself and she's gonna activate one of her uh nanosite arrays she's gonna she's gonna pull out she's gonna corporealize these sort of like

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:25]** plinths that emanate from her arm that become this philosopher's sting which is a sniper weapon yeah she's gonna try and take out the dude on the platform oh love it okay you start moving back that's so cool sorry if i interrupted you there um yeah

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** So he's well within range.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Just going to take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:37]** Take a shot at the Yosuke who's typing away, probably just meaninglessly typing into a Word document.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** They're actually doing a typing exercise to improve their typing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** They're taking notes for Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** That's right.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** I forgot.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Thank you.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Please don't kill that one.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** That one's actually helping.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** And they...

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** What, 23 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** Oh, 23.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** More than does it.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:03]** Roll your damage as you ever the professional from across the gaping chasm.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Bullseye that womp rat.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Bullseye that womp rat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** How much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Four points.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** They get hit.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** You see them start to type with one arm.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** They are continuing to type.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:23]** They're not down, but you definitely injured them.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:27]** And their typing speed is now going to suffer on their next quiz.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** So you really fucked that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:34]** Mavis Beacon will not be able to recover their typing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:40]** All it wanted to be was a court, you know, whatever they're called, the people that take the notes and they can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** A stenographer?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** A stenographer.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** So sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Amazing.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** All right.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** Anonymous Yusoki just disappeared from the notes page.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:55]** You would all get that joke if you ever came on the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** We've gone over this, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** Alright, so you moved 15 feet.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** You technically have 15 feet more movement if you want to take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** No.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Or whatever the remainder of your path is.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** I mean, she's going to try and move back 15 feet.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** Okay.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** She'd do that.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** That'd be great.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** Well, she's probably just going to stay there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** Okay.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** You're going to stay there.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Love it.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** So try and shoot again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Okay.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Playing it smart.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Migo, what are you doing?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** You also need to roll a 42-5.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** Well, I guess I'll get that out of the way.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** How fortuitous is Miko?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** Survey says.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** How fortuitous?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Opportunitous.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** That's a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Leora Luxley?

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Yeah.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Very fortuitous.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:43]** You feel this urge to walk back and your mental training, the amount of things that you've gone through as an evolutionist.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:47]** Maybe you're like, no, I'm not going to let this happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** And you do not need to move half your speed towards the gate.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Is it clear the source of this temptation?

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** The gate.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** The gate itself.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** He told us last time.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** The gate is pulling us all towards it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:06]** I wasn't sure if this devil dog was influencing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:11]** There's even a cool animation of showing if you go towards the gate, it's pulling everything into the gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:19]** If you want to do an engineering check, you can try and maybe suss out a little more about that.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** I'm happy for anybody else to aid if they want to.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Wait, yeah.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** What are we rolling for that?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Mysticism?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** No, engineering.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** Oh, engineering.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** Okay.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** You would use a mysticism if you want to try and figure out what this hound is.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** All right, cool.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** When I can, I'll do it for sure.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Or I guess we're assisting so we can do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Migo, what are you doing?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** If you want to.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** I'm trying to see what my usage time is for Nanite Surge.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Is that a move action?

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** I'm looking to my Nanite fellow party members.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:55]** What are you trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Do you want to do a surge?

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** Yeah, I want to do something called Malignant Mist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:09]** Malignant Mist would have whatever the time is for it, and then the Nanite Surge, you spend the Nanite Surge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** It's just an economy of surges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** It just doesn't tell me if it's an action at all.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** It just says when you form a cloud array or sheath array.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** So you want to form a cloud?

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:25]** Yeah, it's a movement action, I believe, to form... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:29]** That's part of the nanite...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:36]** So you would go to, if you're on Hero Lab, you would go to primary array and then you would select either cloud or sheath.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:42]** And then you would just do whatever the ability is at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** But I think it's a movement action to do.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:49]** But it doesn't say what type of action it is to create it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** No, the action is when you do the other array.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** So the action is a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** I think so.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** In which case, could I have not fired at the Yasuke?

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** What do you mean?

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:07]** Because I used a nanite surge to... I guess it's equipping a weapon, like, in my arm.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** I don't think it counts as a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:35]** against my movement uh that i don't know i think you can do a movement uh i don't know yeah we'll look it up all right i'm gonna use my move action to set up a cloud array in three squares okay i'd have to be three contiguous squares yes they have to be connected to each other and connected to you at some point too but they don't they don't offer concealment or anything right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** Isn't it just like a missed chance?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** Oh, you have an ability you're going to use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** That's right.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:47]** So I'm going to do a cloud array from the northwest Yosuke over to the devil dog.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:50]** Three squares and three squares is all I've got.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:57]** But I'm going to use a malignant mist as part of this cloud array.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:26]** basically it does 1d6 piercing damage to each creature that starts its turn in or enters the clouds area okay and there's a dc12 fortitude save to and it's the uh it's the it's the three between the best guy ff agent and the hound yep thing okay uh what color is the mist um steel blue

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Steel blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Sorry, just to go back a little bit.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:37]** It says that if you use a nanite surge, you can form an array or switch arrays as a swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** So I guess you could also do that, Vinny, if you wanted to waste a second surge.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** You could have done that as a swift action and still get attacks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:53]** Um, yeah, I'm just going to do this as a move action and then get an attack in on the devil dog.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** I'm going to swing my hammer because why?

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Okay.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** That's what I like to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** I was trying to get blue, but it won't be blue.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** It's fine.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Okay.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** So you're going to swing your hammer.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Uh, so let's walk through this.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:07]** Both of them need to do a DC 12 or take a DC 12 fort safe, right?

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Or take damage.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Um, yeah.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Okay.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Copy.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** Let me, uh, let me just do that real quick.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Well, you know, just a little casual, just a little force-ish.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** Yeah.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** DC 12.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Okay.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** The Vest fails.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** It's a D6 of damage.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** You want to roll how much damage that is?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** I'm going to roll it.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Rolling.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** That is six piercing.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** The Hound.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** Hound succeeds.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** So six piercing to the Vest.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** Love it.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** Yep.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:38]** As these little nanites, I guess, start to go bury under the skin is what I'm guessing.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Deal as bleed damage.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Bad a**.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:46]** They can't seem to get through, not mechanically, but the hound passed the 42 safe.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** So you're good.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Take your swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** I'm going to swing in the hound.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:50]** Swing.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Swing.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Swing your what?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** That is an 18 to hit.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** It's an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Are you technically flanking?

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** So it's 20 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Yes.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Just hits.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** Maybe this puppy can be pounded.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Hey-oh.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** I bet the hammer can pound this puppy.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** That's what everyone says.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:22]** I need you guys to alley-oop it up, and it'll be a really good... Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** It'll be a really... Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** That is nine electric damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:32]** Nine electric damage as it arcs through the smoke.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** And you can see... Let me see if I can show the artwork on this thing.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** Because it is freaking awesome.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:42]** And you can see some of the electricity trying to get in between the bones.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** Because it's half there and half not at the same time.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** It's a pretty cool creature.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I'm going to show artwork.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:53]** I'm going to view character artwork first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:58]** You guys see this?

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Yeah.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** It's like... Wow.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:03]** It's like fading into the abyss, but still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:09]** It's like the nightmare version of the werewolf, American werewolf, if you ever...

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:12]** Just big, burly werewolf on all fours.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:20]** But then, like, you could see its skeleton as a body kind of just whiffs away into smoke and darkness.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** It has leaks.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Yeah, it's creepy.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Creepy as hell.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Big-ass tongue thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** I don't know what's worse, this or, like, the Greybounder.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** I still feel the Greybounder's worse.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** That might be the case.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** Maybe.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** Uh...

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:41]** I wanted to show you the token artwork because there's a cool token emblem that I found, but I'll do it later.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Cool.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Awesome.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** There you go.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** So that was your move.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Well done.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** You dealt some damage to this hound.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Maybe it can be extinguished.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** That's it.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Cool.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Love it.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** It's the vest who just took six points of damage turn.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** And you know what it's going to do?

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** It's going to try and grapple you.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:06]** So get your KAC plus eight ready because I am making a combat maneuver against you.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** Let me double check this so I know all the rules.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** It's going to be a grapple.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Here we go.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** That is a... Probably not going to work.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** Negative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** That's probably just meeting your stuff.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Didn't think so.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** That's what he gets for trying to grapple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** It was a dumb move.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Sorry.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** No offense to you.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** It's an offense to him.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** It's really hard to grapple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Hang on one sec.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:35]** Let me remind myself of this weapon because it does have a disarming capture pull.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** And I wanted to see what that did because it does have reach.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:45]** And it does have special grapple, but I think that's just what I'm actually grappling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:48]** John just was really jelly that I had a cool weapon.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** I did.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Equip it himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** That's it.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** That's it.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:57]** That's always... Just to be clear, though, John, you are flanking.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Did you add that bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Ooh, so that would be a 20.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** I think that's probably still... No, not even close.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** No?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Okay.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** All right, sounds good.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Just trying to keep it honest.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Yeah.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Actually, it's going to be a 22.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Still creeping up there?

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Still not there.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Still not there?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Okay.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Actually, it's 24.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** 24, 24.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** We got to talk about that.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** All right.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** All right.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:27]** That vest is going to step out of the cloud because they are smarter than your average onion.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:32]** And they're going to not take those points again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Cecil's going to yell back to Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** Did they take a guarded step?

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Yes, they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Thanks for the reminder.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Take out that Yosuke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:42 - 00:24:03]** boom it's your turn so that's what you did that was your whole turn and next or sorry uh yeah boom what are you doing uh boom uh boom like uh winks at cecil and like nods and then uh now sticking to the rules because i want to be very rules conscious do i need to uh roll a fortitude save as well

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:28]** yes you do all right cool thank you let it be known that i was the one that brought that up yes thank you all right cool just let me know yeah that's cool i'll also note that when ugm the stenographer in the corner of the one arm is typing up it's just to make me feel better i know buddy i do 20 20 20 uh 20 for fortitude saved


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** 24 Fortitude save.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** You pass.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** You feel that same urge, like you want to move half your speed towards the gate, and you pass it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** My cigars are Fortitude brand.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Imported from Space Cuba.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** Space Cuba.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:47]** I mean, it was once basically part of the U.S.S.R., right?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** U.S.S.R.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Well, I mean, not technically.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** Anyway, all right, cool.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:56]** So, during the Space Cold War.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** What are you doing?

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Sorry.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** All right.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:16]** So now, because I know about the rules now, and it was not prompted by anyone to say this or anything worth informed, because it's a small elemental and it's around for like one round per level, he has one more level that he can exist.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** So he's going to exist for one more round.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:25]** And he is going to do the attack that he is allowed to do, which is a...

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** uh, right here.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** It's a slam and that's a 20.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** That's a D 20 plus nine.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** So boom, we'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** Sam against two against, uh, against Cecil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** No, no, no.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** I'll get to Cecil in a second.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** It's against this, uh, this like desk.

**[00:25:43 - 00:26:07]** uh so the vest yeah uh boom says that he's like all right do another slam and then like uh you know uh lightning guy too sees that uh you know uh leora's not around anymore he goes and he goes oh like to the vest like right in front of him and then does the slam and then here we go so i'm gonna roll for the attack that roll for the attack here we go do do do do do

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Sorry, it's a little bit of lag.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:13]** And just waiting for that modal to pop up, which it isn't doing.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** So, oh, here we go.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** So we have a 16.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Does that happen to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** Is that including your plus two for flanking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Oh, then it's going to be an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Yes, that hits.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Bam.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** Lightning slam on this Vesk.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** All right.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** So now we roll a six.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** D6 plus five.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:37 - 00:27:01]** uh it's seven damage good sir seven damage okay that's right taking them down to half health as it courses over their armor gets in starts to pop like pump their heart faster yeah they start sweating keeping with the rules um so uh now he's wondering because he just told you know electric guy what to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** lightning guy.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:10]** So now Boom himself is going to train his gun which he still has out on the Ahsoka in question that Cecil brought up.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** And then he's going to shoot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:32]** okay i probably should have given will cover against that because i think technically would have been there but i think both you actually have a pretty good line of sight and he's standing on the on the chair anyway so it's fine good so he will do that now i think boom you also have a line of sight through the opening at the at the gate to get up there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:54]** what's the range on your weapon yeah um the range is it's it's 55 feet from you to the yeah so slowly sorry like it i click on something it takes five seconds to react um didn't you get a brand new computer no it's it's i just arrived so i haven't picked it up oh okay all right so the range is 60 feet so we're good to go

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** You are good to go.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** And here we go.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** So rolling for attack.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Love it.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Just add five seconds to everything I say.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** All right, here we go.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** So it's 816 to hit.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Against EAC or KAC?

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** Against KAC because it's a machine gun.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** That I know from heart.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** All right, cool.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** That is it.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** And then for rolling for damage, it's 13 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** 13 damage?


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Wow.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Not bad, right?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Well done.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** Well done.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Okay.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** I turned your mouth and smoke it.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** What?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** I'm not British, but there you go.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** Stick that in your mouth and smoke it.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** Then he takes a drag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** It's the voice modulator acting up again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:44]** The shot from the bullet from behind causes them to lean over and they actually fall over the edge.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Yes!

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:54]** Hitting all the pipes going down and you just see a little... Hits every branch down the ugly tree on the way down.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** And they die.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** They are dead.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** Hit every f***ing thing.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Drop out of the turn order.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Well done.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** But what happens now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** I heard you loud and clear, Cecil.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** He says that.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** Is the gate still juicing or what?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** The gate is still juicing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:35]** keeping with the rules again um he's not really looking to move because he's still able to shoot the thing that he wants to shoot uh perhaps the next round and he's used up all of his other sort of stuff that he can do and i would call that a b plus on the rules it wasn't too bad right so there we go i would call that an a all right that's good thanks if you want to know more about


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:55]** either a the hound or b why the gate is still doing what it's doing keep in mind that you might have to move places do some checks figure it out or maybe you just want to focus on the threats at hand that's how about just an engineering check on the gate if if it's okay from here to do so totally sounds good yeah all right cool um so i'm gonna do that now

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** This is going to be kind of a general check based on what you've seen.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Okay.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:02]** So give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** So Boom has seen some of it for sure, and he's certainly seen what's happened to it now.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** He rolled a 24.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** 24 is very good.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:14]** Obviously, whatever they were doing seems to be...

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:22]** Whatever they were doing while they were typing does seem like it had to do with this effect of being pulled in, but it hasn't gone away yet.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:26]** And you think the effect of this pulling in, maybe it's added to the gate.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:32]** No one else, none of the other creatures except for us have been the ones that have been affected.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:37]** And maybe this is something that's been added on to the original purpose of the gate.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** Is this like gravity being pulled in?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** And it's not part of the original purpose.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** So whatever the Yusuke was doing was related to that.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** But nothing has happened yet.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:52]** So you think maybe it might be that I have to go up there to disable it.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Maybe it might be something that might go away after a few rounds.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** I'm not sure because there's nobody actively monitoring it right now.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:02]** You probably have to go to the console to see, to actually get a better readout about what the gate's doing.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** What's this lock that it has with the colors?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** What's this gravity going in?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Boom.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** So the console's still there.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** That's good.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:16]** So Boom tells the group, he's like, it is specifically targeting us and not them.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** And knowing what I know, this is not the original purpose of gate.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** We are capable as she is, and...

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** probably has modified it.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** But I know that Yasuki was somehow contributing to this effect.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** So I will try to go up there and undo it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** All right, so just hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Boom, that's a mouthful.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:41]** Just do what you always do and blow up the console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** It looks like a desk.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** It looks like a desk.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** It's a desk, I swear.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Just blow up the desk.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Cecil, it's your turn.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** It's not always time for boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:50 - 00:32:09]** meta game though like could he retarget like you could target leora with this thing if you go over to the council as long as i'm saying yeah yeah i potentially unless there's something in our bodies it's like the nanites and i don't know you're gonna have to go to the console to figure it out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:15]** And I'm... I really want to crit fish, but at the same time, I don't know if it's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** Sorry.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Boom's going to move then.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** Yeah, move it, boom, move it.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:24]** So he can make that entire move in like one turn.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Okay.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** He's going to do that.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Cool, love it.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** Wait, you have 60 feet of movement?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** I have 50...

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Okay.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** What?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** I'm confusing the two things.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** The rules are suffering again.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I haven't slept a lot.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** So, yeah.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** What is my range?

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** You should have 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Not your range.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Your range is your weapon.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** Your speed.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Which I don't know where...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:05]** i always forget where it's at it's right at the top of your page underneath like stamina resolve points my speed is five feet oh it's because i'm over encumbered with all the like crazy stuff it's fine you're not over encumbered if you're not over encumbered i think it's for third you should be 30 30 for uh yosuke you're fine yeah so okay you can move how am i 20 are you wearing like heavy armor and covered or anything

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** You shouldn't be in Cumber because of the stuff that I added on.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** You should, but if you're wearing heavy armor, maybe?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** This is 30 feet, I believe.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** From where you were before?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Cool.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** I think, yeah, that is 30 feet.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** That's 35 with a diagonal, so let's just move on back.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Your lip just booted me out.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Is that on the thing?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** You look like you're off the thing, Kelly.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Get it together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** All right.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Boom.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Cecil, what are you doing?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** There's a lot going on.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Things are, like, popping off here.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Do I need to do a Fortitude save?

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Yes, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Thank you for reminding me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:41 - 00:34:01]** so wait if you fail you have to do another one do we have to roll them at every turn you you had an 18 uh no the first person to roll to save was cara car yeah cecil uh you are good you feel like your body wants to move forward but you're just able to like withhold it and not do that

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** So what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:08]** I really wanted to, like, just try to do a full attack, but that would take me down to just raw rolls, which is dumb.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:15]** So I'm going to just attack the Yasuki that is... Or not the Yasuki, the Vesk.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:25]** But I'm going to do a guarded step down behind the Elemental.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Okay.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:30]** So I step away from the dog, and then I'm stepping behind the elemental.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** So now the elemental is pinched between me and the Vesk, and I'm going to attack the Vesk with my polearm.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Oh, does that give it soft cover, though?

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** That would.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Never mind.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** I'm going to attack and then move.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** So reverse that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Attacking the Vesk and then moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** Man, this 10 is, like, really liking this.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Yeah.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** 10 plus 4 plus 2, though.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** So 16 to hit.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** That hits.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Yes.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Nice.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:01]** And so that is going to be 1d8 plus 7 points of non-lethal damage.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** It's 3 for 10 points of non-lethal damage.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Wait, why non-lethal?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** You're so obsessed with non-lethal now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Okay.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Because of what we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Just because.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** How do you knock them unconscious?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** What, Sagan?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** How do you knock them unconscious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** I think, like...

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** The elemental as... Is this the end of the elemental's turn?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** The next turn it vanishes, right?

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** Yeah, it vanishes next turn.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:33]** As it goes to vanish, he just whips his pike through right at the neck of the Vesk and hits him.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Right in the chin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** Love it.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Love it.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Knocks them back.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Head right angle.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** They fall down.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Knocked unconscious.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** They are out of the fight for now.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** Love it.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** Love it.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Took him out.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Guard a step away.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** You're good to go.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** It's Archie's turn.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** Archie has...

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Let's see how far Archie can go.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** How far did I have Archie go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Cecil's eyeing Archie so hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** Archie can move 30 feet and fly 30 feet.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** So they're going to move 30 feet.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Archie's going to move.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** They can move over to... Why did that not move?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Oh, that's why.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:22]** Archie can move 30 feet up following... Boom.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** Yeah, that is a little weird, man.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** Didn't you tell Archie to go investigate what the Yusuke was doing?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** Did I?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Yeah.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** No, I did.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** Yep.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** So it's doing what you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Is Archie not aware that Yusuke's dead?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Oh, but what it was doing.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Yeah, I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** Archie's trying to take in as much as possible.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** Plus, you could use Archie as a bonus for a computer check.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** This is true as long as Archie's not a player.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** You get a plus two bonus to perception and to attack rolls once per combat.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** You get a plus two bonus.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Just kidding.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Archie's a bad guy.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** You get a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** What the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Why are you setting it up like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** It's just like, it reminded us of the Halo dude, who's a traitor, by the way.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** No, it only reminded you of the Halo dude.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** I haven't played Halo.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** And Will was just telling me how much he wants to play Halo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** That's all he's going on about.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** I just bought an Xbox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** He just bought the original Xbox.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** He just bought the original Xbox.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** The one they have to bake in the oven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:27]** I will go to my death on this hill.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** The original Xbox controller was the best controller ever.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** That was a good controller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Wait, why?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** It was so big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** It was perfect.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** You're just wrong.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** It was perfect.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** It filled your palms.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** It dropped your fingers in just the right places.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** It filled your palms.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** All the buttons were easily in reach.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:54]** The thumbsticks had... The thumbsticks were not in... The thumbsticks were perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** I'm a fan of PlayStation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** I love the Duke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:01]** PlayStation till I die.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** PlayStation's controls are so good that they haven't changed.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** They're just so well balanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** It's like, how do you fix perfection?

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** Add more haptic feedback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:21]** It is now noted that Vinny has died on that hill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Vinny has died on that hill.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** It was a really big hill as well.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** It was a big hill.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** It was the size of the controller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:30]** It was shaped like an Xbox controller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:35]** I mean... Are you talking about the Xbox controller that had the slot for the thing in the back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** It's like the Dreamcast.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Okay, that was the second Dreamcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Top around three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** The Hound.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** He's going.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Sees that.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Cecil has stepped away.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** He's kind of pissed.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** That Migo hit it.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** So it's going to attack Migo.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** That hits.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** That hits.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** You didn't even ask him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** I don't see his token, though.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Where's his token at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Oh, it's still.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:11]** Is the thing that if it starts its turn in that cloud that it takes that damage, Benny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** Yes, but if it saves, it's immune for one minute.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Okay.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** And it already saved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** Okay, so it's good.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** So it's cool.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** It's cool.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** Okay.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** All right.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Ten rounds.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Okay.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Yikes.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:38]** You take... There's this ethereal smoky claw that I imagine is like the Velociraptor from the start of Jurassic Park, where it just, like, comes out and slashes across your chest as you take 16 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Cheater!


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:41 - 00:40:00]** 16 points 16 points of damage I took 20 points 16 points of damage and then it is going to teleport and you're going to get an attack of opportunity I believe because it's technically casting a spell

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** Wait, would Lightning Guy as well get one?

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** No, because unless your reach is 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Rick gets one.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Sorry, Cecil gets one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** No, because you're 15 feet away, Cecil.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** No, I'm only 10 feet.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** No, you're two diagonals away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** I'm one diagonal away.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Oh, it's a 15?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** You're right.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Sorry, my bad.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** I thought for reach, though, that didn't count.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** No, that counts.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Reach is 10 feet.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** What's your AO up?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** I'll look it up.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** It is with my Adaptive Strike.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Ooh.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** You're welcome.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** That's a 22.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** It's a 22 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** That hits again.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** I think it means that it doesn't actually move through the spell.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Oh.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** The spell is not cast, so it stays where it is.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** You're like... Stay right here.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Love it.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Love it.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Okay.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Not so fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** What's your damage?

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** 13 lightning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** 13 lightning damage.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** That's max damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:07]** Again, cascading through its body and evaporating into the smoke.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** What a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** It is.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** First diagonal is only one square.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** Second diagonal is two squares and so on.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** I'm fairly certain.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:21]** I remember 10 foot reach lets you do two spaces on diagonals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:25]** I don't think it lets you do more than its actual time.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:30]** Just like in general, I think we're going to go with it doesn't.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** We're going to keep moving.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** If you find something that says that it does, we can just move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** You're going to make me have to look up the rule.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Cool.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** We got to keep this game going.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** The floor recognizes Kevin Decker.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Is it Decker again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:50]** It doesn't make sense to me that you're 15 feet away because of diagonals.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** And you have a 10-foot reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** But for reach, you get a 10-foot reach.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** So where you would be hitting 5 feet, it's 10 feet.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** And I'm pretty sure it says in the reach section it counts on the diagonal.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** But I'm going to look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** We'll wait while you look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** No, don't wait because only one person gets an attack of opportunity, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** No, it's anyone who threatens that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Oh, I just thought as soon as the spell was over it didn't count anymore, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Oh, I mean, yeah.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:21]** You could have slapped its butt while Migo smacked it.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:25]** If your reach is 10 feet, you threaten the second square of the diagonal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Yep, so you're good.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Nice.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** So you can do an attack of opportunity.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Go ahead.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Well then.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Vindicated.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Kevin Decker.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Vindicated!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:44]** So 12 on the die for a total of plus threatened for plus two.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Yeah.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** Plus another four for a total of 18.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Doesn't hit.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** 18 does not hit.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Correct.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** It doesn't matter what your reach is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** Kara Valtara, what are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:05]** Well, Kara Valtara has an unwieldy weapon, so she can't fire at full attack.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:11]** So she's just going to lay it out against the hellhound.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Okay.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** You're going to full attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Well, I can't make a full attack because it's unwieldy.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Yep.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Sorry.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:40]** uh 19 to hit eac eac it is a force weapon which deals bludgeoning damage but it targets eac that's a hit boom boom you hit this freaking animal oh there's one six and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:42 - 00:44:03]** no freaking way 12 no it's uh yeah 12 points of bludgeoning 12 points of bludgeoning damage dude double sixes you guys are starting to nice little box cars there you guys are starting to take this thing down little bit by little bit i love it i gotta go to vegas yeah dude go right now just leave leora destructs lee


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** Too much.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Did he have to roll a fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** I need to roll a fortitude save for that.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:17]** You do actually need to do it because you failed last time, so you need to roll it.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I need to roll it?

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Yeah, because you failed last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:25]** Once you pass, you don't need to roll again, but you failed, so you need to roll it again every turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:30]** I actually got a... My fortitude is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** 22.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** You pass.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** You feel that urge to watch towards the gate, and you're like, nah, it's cool.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** You have a move action.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** No.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Love it.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Sounds good.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Migo.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Migo7.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Did you turn off this gate already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:52]** What are you doing?

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** What do I want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** We want to do the top round three here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Why is no one ever adjacent to each other?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** That's really annoying.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:03]** I took Cleave because I really wanted to multi-hit.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** No one ever stands next to each other, so it doesn't f***ing matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** They have to be adjacent to each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:11]** Nothing really matters.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** Cool.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:18]** I'm going to keep working on the devil dog because that seems the clearest present danger.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:24]** And that is a 10 on the die for 17 plus 2, 19.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** EAC case.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** EAC.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** That's a hit.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** That's a hit.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** That's a hit dog.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** That is a hit dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Hey dog.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** That's a hit dog.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Hey, Commodog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** Is it a tres comas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Tres comas.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** For eight electric damage.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Eight electric damage.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:47]** He hits the ground right in front of the dog and then just like... Yeah, cascades up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** Love it.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** What else do you want to do?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** That's it.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** Actually, I want to take a guarded step.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** That's a measuring tape.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** I want to take a guarded step this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** Towards the door a little bit.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Okay, cool.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** We go.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:05]** Takes a guarded step between the dog and the lightning elemental on Cecil.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:10]** It is the vest's turn next to you.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:32]** they they follow you and they are going to swing at you with a oh not gonna hit that was a nine not gonna hit at all swing they are they are halfway down a lot's going on there's some crazy other dimension dog happening right now and they are not with it uh boom what are you doing with it the other dimension dog


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** All right.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:37]** So Boom is going to continue his journey up to where exactly is it?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:42]** I just see like a block connected to where's the actual panel that he would interact with.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** It's up here.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** It's up close to the end.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:47]** The rest of us click to highlight it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Keep going, Kelly.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** One more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Shut up.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** It's a little chair.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** That's a chair you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Okay.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** All right.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** All right.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** All right.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** Let me move my thing up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:01]** It's like still warm from the Yosuke who was standing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Yep.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Yep.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Yep.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** That's sad.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** But good.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** So, all right.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** Boom is going to... Boom tells Archie...

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** Archie's probably not going to make it in time, but it could be good for a roll later.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** He's like, hurry up here and help me out with this.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Let's turn this thing off.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:22]** Boom is going to roll a computer check, try to find out what he can do to shut it down.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Give me a computer check.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:28]** He'll do that when Computer Lab deems it worthy to do so.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Okay, yes, for sure.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:34]** Well, it's not working, so he's going to use... He pulls out a d20.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:39]** Okay, so 16, and then plus... As opposed to what?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** I normally do digital die.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** That's what I meant.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** So it's a 20... No, excuse me.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Yeah, 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** 26 computers.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Okay.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** Tasty.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:57]** You can tell that with the 26 computers, you will be able to make an engineering check.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** This is a very complex system.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** You don't understand a lot of it.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** You can turn off this pull thing.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:09]** It seems like everybody has succeeded at their save, so it might not be worth it.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:15]** As far as what's going on with it, you think this is locking on to some destination, right?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:19]** This gate has locked onto some destination with those orange and then green lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Well, yeah.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** But anything else, like where that destination is?

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:25]** Because he kind of figured that, though.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Is there anything else he could know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:32]** With a 26, I'll tell you that the destination...

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:45]** You don't know where the destination is, but I'll say that you are able to determine that if you want to turn the gate off or do anything of that nature, it's already locked in.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** That's part of what the Yosuke was doing was...

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Setting it so you can't turn the gate off.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** The best thing that you can do is shoot it, destroy it, try and overload it.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Could he know why it was just pulling on us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** You think that it's pulling on the nanites in your body?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** There's not much I can do to shut it down, unfortunately.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:08]** But it was pulling on us because of those nanites.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** We need to shoot and destroy it if we really want to get rid of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Yeah, that's what I was trying to say earlier.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** All right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Boom.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Boom.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Make it go boom.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** I'm always down for a good boom.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** And then he... Well, that's kind of, I think, all he can really do.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** He can't move back.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Okay.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** He can move back five feet, so he'll do so.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Okay.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** He starts to, like, run back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** Yeah.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Okay.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Sounds good.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Cecil, what are you doing?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:41]** Cecil is going to step up because now the... So wait, sorry, is the elemental gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** Yeah, I just took it away because it would have ended at the end of Boobster.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Oh, it goes away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** It's like, oh!

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** Bye!

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:51]** And since we're playing a video game, the body of the vest disappeared too.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** So Cecil's going to step to where the vest had fallen.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:06]** And then he is going to take a lethal strike at the dog.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** The shadow dog.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** So let me turn my lethality off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** Let me turn my lethality off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** Turn my lethality on.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Going lethal.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** It's the pike.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:29]** The pike's got a... This is all in my head, but still, the pike has a rubber mallet ball on the end of it for non-lethal strikes, and then it's got an actual blade for lethal strikes.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Love it.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:36]** So he turns it, and he slices with this thing, and that gives me an extra plus two to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** Like one of those rubber nibs on a ballpoint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** And that is a natural 20.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** That was clutch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:49]** Natural 20 on this creature.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Let's see.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Let's see.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** I didn't even need to turn off or go lethal.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** I could have done a non-lethal attack.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** You didn't need to at all, so you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** Could have kept the tip on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** Critical hit deck.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** You want to do that or you want to do the effect?

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** I want to do critical hit.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:06]** Okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Roll tick.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Roll tick.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Okay, let me know.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** I'm going to do a quick shuffle.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Let me know.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Ready?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Three, two, one.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** There.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Okay.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** What kind of attack is it?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** That's a kinetic.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Okay.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** It's not, unfortunately, what you wanted to hear.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Bonus effect.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** You can immediately take an additional move action, walking fire.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** Nice.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:33]** So you still do double damage and add the things and then add all your bonuses and you get an additional move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** I don't know if I need an additional move action, though.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** I'm trying to see.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** I don't think there's any critical bonus for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** You don't want to just do a lap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Just take a jog.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Just keep running?

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Yeah.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Alright, love it.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** There's no special for this.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** Fools.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** But that's going to be 2d8 plus 14.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Give me that number.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** I screwed that one up.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** That's a 2 plus a...

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** Four for six plus 14 is 20 points of damage.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** 20 points of damage?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:14]** This thing looks like it is hurting here.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Still up?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** It's still up, dude.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** It's still up.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** What the f***?

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** But it is hurting a lot.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** It's hurting a lot.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** I love it.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Well done.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Well done.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** And then you've already moved.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** Or no.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Yeah, you step forward.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** Shot.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Deal bad f***ing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Love it.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Love it.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** He's going to step back and then step back in for this extra movement action.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Do a little hop step.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Take it back now, y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:44]** Archie comes up, gets a good view of what is happening here along the... Turns around, sees what you were doing, boom.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:49]** And then turns back and is trying to record all the footage of what's happening down below.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** And not helping at all with what's actually happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** So...

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:57]** I am going to... Is this phase two of the fight?

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** Is this Leora Reduxly?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** That was a good one.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** That's the best one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:05]** We haven't done any checks to see where the hell Leora is.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** No, you have not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Okay.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Cecil.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:27]** the shot comes from behind you and you are going to take nine points of damage as this pistol hits your body.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:32]** And for a second, you just, you, you lose a sense of where you are.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** And then immediately you snap back.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** How do I know it hits me?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** Because it beat your EAC.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** You got my EAC up there?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** You take nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** John, how much did you hit me for?

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:50]** I don't take nine points of damage.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** I take...

**[00:53:52 - 00:54:03]** Because as the bullet hits the back of my skull, nanites go and tighten up and take away four points of damage.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Okay.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** So I take five points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** You take five points of damage.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Okay.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** All righty.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** Well, how much did you hit me for?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I hit you for an 18.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** That barely passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** Oh, but it did.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** It did a deep pass.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:21]** Would I be able to take a reaction off of this or no, because she's invisible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** I think no, because you didn't know where the shot was coming from.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Because you were unaware of both.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** You were aware of presence, but you were not aware of location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:37]** I don't want to presume to know what she's doing, but my understanding of most of those spells is once you attack, you're no longer invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Your understanding is correct.

**[00:54:41 - 00:55:00]** not i am not going to change anything that's on the board with that shed cool yeah yeah no there's definitely not a reason for that so it's cool okay cecil i need you to give me a fortitude safe why i just do just separate from the gate because he's the gm and that's what you need to do

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:26]** that is another 20 i'ma die oh okay so fortitude is 28 you feel like uh like the hound was trying to just like trying to like get a hold of you and uh like rip into your mind again and was not able to nice yeah so you are you are good to go question is stay out of my head okay

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** What do I want to do?

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** What do I want to do?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** It's going to try and teleport again.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** Both Cecil and Migo get an AOA.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Who goes first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:44]** 17 on the die for a total of plus 6 for 23 plus 2 more.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** That hits.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** That hits.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** 25.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** That hits.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** That's good.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Well done.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:54]** 5 plus 7 is 12 points of damage.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** 12 points of damage.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Migo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:00]** How stacked is this freaking hound?

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** And how much damage did Migo do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** For 11 electric damage.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** 11 electric damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Okay.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** I think technically you have soft cover because I'm behind Migo.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** That's fine.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** I think it still hits, right?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** It's fine.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** It looks like it's hurting.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** It looks like it's hurting real bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** How much damage did it take just now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:43]** 30 something points i'm just saying john i feel like this is the final boss okay okay cool cara it's your turn what are you doing yeah cara cara is gonna she so we didn't see the where the shot came from you did it came from over here came from about 10 feet behind cecil and it didn't reveal like leora no she is currently not visible

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** Yeah.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** Well, she's only going to hit shoot at what she can see.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:52]** So she's going to shoot at the devil dog over here.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** What's your role here?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** That is a 21 to hit.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** That is going to be a hit.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** EAC.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** What are you doing?

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:07]** First one is a three and seven points of damage.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:10]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** From the lead philosopher, Sting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** From the lead philosopher, Sting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** Describe your kill.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:21]** Ooh.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:38]** The throng of these reverberating sort of, I don't know, obelisks, whatever, these geometrical shapes that make up this philosopher's sting sort of just rattle with this sort of intensity.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:47]** And this force of energy, like, just comes bolting out across the gangplank.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Yeah.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:53]** And I would say just engulf this dog.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:58]** Like, it's just a bolt of, you know, glowing energy.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Glowing white.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Just in the shadow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Yeah.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** It's like a bright flash.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:14]** And I'm assuming it just evaporates this dude with a bunch of, like, blood... Like, it's the force of, like, a, you know, high-explosive grenade.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:19]** It's like a pink mist just around this... Where this creature used to be.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:25]** Although, it's probably not pink mist, like, in real life.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Because...

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** Yeah.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** It's like a, it's like a hell creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:34]** So it's probably like, you know, you didn't even do any mysticism check to see what it was.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** So you don't know.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Yeah.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** It's not a hellhound.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** I'll tell you that.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** Uh, but rad, great description, destroyed it.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:51]** And as it happens, there's this, this huge blinding white light that just hits all of you.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** And you're,

**[00:58:53 - 00:59:00]** Just for a brief second, not mechanically, but for a brief second, you are blinded.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:15]** And as you open your eyes, you start to hear this sound behind you of feet walking.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** Walking.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:31]** And we're going to stay in initiative order because out of a door around the corner that maybe you didn't see appears a Raxalite and 10 Morrow Strike Force soldiers.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** They are armed.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Guns are drawn.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:42]** And boom, you especially can't help but notice that they all have breaching charges.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** On their belt pouch.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Good choice.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:53]** And in front of them, for a brief second, you see Lieutenant Lua.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** And you hear this small voice that you know so well.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** You've had drinks with her, talked with her about things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Wait, she's on our side, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** Leora Huxley, you've wasted everyone's time.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** And it is not a better tomorrow because of you.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** Your experiment has come to an end.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:24]** Stars team, get the fuck in that gate or fucking die.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** I don't really fucking care.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** What the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** I don't like this.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Great.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Betrayer.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** What's it going to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** You've got to find out next time on What's In The Podcast.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** What's going to happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Bet you can't guess.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** I bet you can't guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Yeah.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** I can't guess.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** I bet you can't guess.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** The Leora thing I could sort of see coming.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** I did not see this coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Rexalites are so cute and trustworthy.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Dang it.
