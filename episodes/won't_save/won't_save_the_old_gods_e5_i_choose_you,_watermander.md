**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollers in the creeks, we find four brave souls whose tale

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:36]** has yet to be told, and these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:45]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper on the wind.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:52]** Hanks and Burgers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the picking.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** In these woods, the mountains' secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:05]** Welcome to Won't Save, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Hello there, family.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:19]** I'm Vinny Rodriguez, your slightly concussed GM, here with John Swan, Kelly Gilliam, Heath Parker, and Will Garrett.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** This is Won't Save.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** Won't Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Won't Save!

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Won't Save!

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** Won't save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Won't save.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** We're definitely not saving Cletus, that's for sure.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Cletus might make it out.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:35]** Can we do some rolls?

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Can Cletus swim?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Jesse barely made it out with his head intact.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** Can Possible swim?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:49]** Cletus is just going to be trying to dig his way up because he changes his mind and Ira throws a wrench in his head.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** He just sinks below the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:56]** Quit messing with my tools, Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** Possums not only can swim, they like to swim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** There you go.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** But in these rapids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** But in these woods.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** That possum won't swim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:15]** I'd like to roll a sleight of hand to get Cletus and put him on my back like a backpack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I'm down for this.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:20]** As long as it doesn't change loyalties or whatever, I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:26]** You save somebody from a river, maybe you're their new favorite person.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** I don't like where this is going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** What's the value of a large possum named Cletus?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** How much would I get if I sold a Cletus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** It's more like he has a set of skills, you know what I mean?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** He's very good at, you know, drawing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** Cletus is a Liam Neeson of possums?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, a certain set of skills.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** Yeah.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:51]** I'm thinking now that there's a Taken movie with Cletus.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** It's like twisting people's necks and shit.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Like, you know.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** Taken 7.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** The old gods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** I want to see the re-edit of Taken where all the characters are possums.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** That's... Or just like... That can happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Yeah, it can.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** Taken by Paws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:20]** That would be a great little one-shot or mini-arc in 2E or a Paizo game or something where you can use uplifted creatures.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** That's a new thing in 2E.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:28]** You can basically do whatever animal type you want and have an uplifted version of it.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Oh, man.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Do an all-uplifted possum party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** Why have you not done this for CF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** The idea just came to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** You have to do it.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** It's a must.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:46]** I mean, we'll trade Z next time, you know, we do something that we'll save can come on to.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** We'll run the full uplifted possum party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** Do one of the Skittermander series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:53 - 00:04:00]** I'll just go watch like taken one, two and three and be like, okay, what story beats can I pull to make like a little two or three shot out of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Absolutely.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Good luck.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** I love it.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:08]** Or, Vinny, you just take a break from this game.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** So we'll take a break from the game that we're using to take a break from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** No, it's a flashback to Cletus's prior life.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That's a life he wants to forget.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** His prior life on a starship.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** How far he's fallen to the Possum Palace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** Well, he's in hiding.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** He's hiding, like, through time and space, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** He's like Nibbler from Futurama.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** He's there to, like, yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** He's in witness protection, yeah, at the Possum Palace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** His real name's not Cletus.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** He adopted that one when he got to this year's Appalachia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Yeah.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** He's Mr. Poopybutthole from Rick and Morty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Yes.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Yes.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** This is fun.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** You guys are the best.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Cool.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** We're going to play another game that we haven't played before.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Ooh-wee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Ooh-wee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Stop.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:35]** thank you if that's not a yes and i don't i don't know what it is this game is called shared holiday so we're going to talk about a shared holiday again in pairs um each new sentence begins with yes and and we're just going to talk about the most outrageous maybe it's real maybe it's fake we don't know uh shared holidays we've ever had so we'll go we'll go five sentences deep try to keep this quick

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** How are we going to decide who plays?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Mathrox again.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:45]** Highest Roller is going to be out for the next session so that we can get this around the horn.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** And throw the dice in.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** 3, 2, 1, go.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Get this around the palace.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** I rolled an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Twelve.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Kelly?

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Oh, my God.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Eighteen.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Cool.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** But that means I set it out, though, and not do it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** No, that means you do it.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** That means you go first.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Oh, God.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** And then you and I actually have to... I'll just let you sit out after this one.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** No, that's fine.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** I'm down to play the improv games.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** It's all right.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I just wish I rolled this high in the actual game.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Yep.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** All right, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:42]** wait so who's not in uh it's it's me and kelly oh okay i have no idea how we're playing this but okay guys are we are we are we recounting our adventure are we telling the other dudes about it um we'll say that we are we are recounting this to ourselves but sharing it with the group cool so like as if you and i were talking about it in this circle of humans


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** So it's very similar to the last game.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** There's just five sentences.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:52]** And instead of coming up with stuff, you're talking about a shared holiday that you had with the other person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:52 - 00:07:05]** Do you remember, Benny, the time... I want to regale our friends with this story about the time that we fought that giant mummy in the Himalayas.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Yes!

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** And he had the most spectacular ruby slippers on.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Yes.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** And then we stole them.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:16]** And then we got transported to this Appalachian area where we're telling this story now.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** Yes.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** And that witch had that house dropped on her.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:27]** And yes, and then it reminded us eerily of that one movie that was set during the Depression and shit like that in the Dust Bowl or whatever.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Yes.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** I do remember that.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** That was wild.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** And we kicked his ass.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** Yeah, we did.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** He must have got nothing on us.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Something like that.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Yep.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Cool.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Rolling up, gentlemen.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Kelly, take a break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** That sounds wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** 14.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** 20.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** Okay, Johnny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Wasn't this supposed to be about a holiday, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Yeah, holiday.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** It was a holiday.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** It could be the American interpretation or the international interpretation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Oh, okay, like vacation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** That's why I was confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** I was like, what holiday was the last story during?

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** It sounds Halloween-ish, but maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Oh, yeah, my bad.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:14]** I meant it in the European sense for some reason that I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** That's fine.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** It's an improv game.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** It's whatever we come up with.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** So it's Heath and I. Yep.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Oh, cool.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** Heath gets the option to kick it off.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Let me see.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** My brain keeps going to it being a holiday.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** My brain won't handle the European version of holiday.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** So make it a holiday.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:41]** Remember Christmas 2017 when we stole a cop car in Little Rock, Arkansas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Yes.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:56]** In fact, I quite remember that because you were the one who turned on the siren and just went all the way out to Arizona with the siren on the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:05]** Yeah, it was a really long trip, and it was odd that we didn't realize until we got to Arizona that there were two people who had been arrested in the backseat the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:12]** Yeah, and then what's crazy is that they were actually native Arizonans, and they actually brought us in for their family Christmas.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Remember that?

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Because we brought them home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Yeah, it was wonderful.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:24]** Really unusual fare at that meal, though, as they cooked an entire spitted roast camel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** No frankincense this year.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:35]** All right.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** One more roll.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** Natural one.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** I've rolled a three and a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** I can't tell if it's a seven or a one.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** He's looking real close.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** I'm going to say it's a one so that Will can go.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Okay.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** John, you kicking it off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** Yeah, I am.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:11]** Hey, Will, do you remember that one Christmas Eve where just one of the worst people that we know decided to hole up in an abandoned high rise and threatened to possibly like blow the place up?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** Remember that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** Yeah, that was wild.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** I'm trying to remember if it was... I'll say.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** It was Liam Neeson, right?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:29]** And he had just broken up with his girlfriend and was really upset that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** Did he mention the farm animals?

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:40]** Yeah, which was... He mentioned the farm animals, and what was crazier was that it was Liam Neeson as a possum.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:48]** And so it was just really interesting to see how much he went and kind of was really obsessed with the cows.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Remember that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** Yeah, I do remember that.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** He was obsessed with the cows...

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:03]** Because I feel like he was confused that they were trying to find truffles out in the building.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:08]** And it's like, they're cows for one, they're not pigs.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** And they're also, there's no truffles in this building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:22]** Yeah, and then right when he was about to go confront these cows, then this person, this wild individual just ran in and just shouted, Potbelly pig!

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** And ran over to the cows.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Remember that?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** That was crazy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** I was waiting for someone to walk in with, like, truffle fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** That was good.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** I would watch that movie.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** I mean, I would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Cletus Neeson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** That is the icing on the cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** In Live Soft or Die Hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:48 - 00:12:04]** oh my god die hard with liam neeson as a possum and his wife who's estranged or they're going through a rough time yeah searching for truffles in nakatomi plaza yep that's it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:11]** Cletus Neeson has a very particular set of skills, but being a good husband is not one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Yes.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** Skills he's collected over a long career.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** It makes him a nightmare for his wife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** And for Truffles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** But we hope that he can rebuild his relationship with his stepdaughter, though.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** That'll be good.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Yeah.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** That's what I want to see.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** That'll be the sequel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Yeah.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Yeah.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** I was going to say that.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Live soft, too.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:37]** I just can't wait until the fifth or sixth movie when he ramps a car into a helicopter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Oh, man.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** This is so good.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** I don't want to stop it, but I will because we have a game to play, gentlemen.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:49]** Previously on The Old Gods.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** We made our way through the woods.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** We met a character.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Did anybody ask his name?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Jesse.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Okay, good.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** I couldn't remember.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** I recognize him.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** You recognize Jesse.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** He's a shiner.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:05]** He certainly has a shiner after Ira chucked a f***ing wrench at his head.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:11]** Cole's wrench.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** Not my wrench.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:19]** As it flips through the air, there's a slow-mo zoom-in of the engraved property of Cole Ward on the wrench.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** CW.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:42]** um you met jesse he told you a little bit more about langley and then uh he went along on his way we made it to the possum palace the palace of possums that couldn't possibly be any better prepared for the potential destruction of the uh that that luxury cruise vessel


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** The water palanquin.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:52]** My nice suite is now underwater.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** All of my books written in possum.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** They're all gone.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Everything's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** Written in possum is a phrase that I just love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** It's just scratches.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** That's all it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** That books exist in possum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Just a bunch of little paw prints.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Don't underestimate them.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Oh, look at Cletus.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** He thinks he's people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Looks remarkably similar to like ancient Phoenician.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** They were water people, the Phoenicians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** They were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** They were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** They're evolved from ancient possums, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Wait, so was the Possum Palace a houseboat for you?

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Or you have a treehouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:40]** The Possum Poat was just your... No, I mean, like, if you can... The whole palanquin thing was kind of a... I like where Keith is going with it, and I agree.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** It is a very... It was a very nice, like, boat.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** It's kind of like those old, like, Mark Twain, like, steamboat kind of things.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:49]** But instead of steam powered, the possums were just, like, rotating it.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:49]** You know what I mean?

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** To get it to move.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** And, like, that's what it was.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** It's a riverboat.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Everyone had their own chambers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** Appalachian riverboat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** Yeah, it was a riverboat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** A riverboat can't go through rapids.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** It's not designed for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** It's a magical boat.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** It's not designed for that.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** That dog won't hunt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** I mean, in a movie with Cletus Neeson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** That possum don't swim.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** I've seen Cletus do some crazy s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** He's going to ramp the water palanquin into a helicopter.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** There's nothing he can't do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** Please, we'll fix it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** The helicopters also wouldn't.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** The possum copter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Yeah, possum copter, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** The possum copter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** I love this.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** Little do we all know that the Wright brothers actually learned from the possums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:51]** I would love to see a chart of the amount of possum mentions over the course of this run and how it's just spiked in the last two episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** We have the data.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** We have the technology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** We can build it.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** It definitely exists.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:06]** The river has tossed and turned the boat and capsized it effectively.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:10]** Cletus, Captain Jack Sparrows, down with the ship.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** Saving throws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** He's actually all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** He'll pop up.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** He's been through worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Cletus, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Oh, thank God.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** All right, Cletus, just swim to shore, buddy.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Swim to shore.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:33]** Wait, wait.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Do you need some help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** You know I don't speak Spanish?

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** Oh, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** So...

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** I'm not even mad.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** That's just impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:52]** So, hearing the chirps for help, we'll, like, dive in and try to rescue him.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Julius will dive in, too.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:59]** Iroh will not dive in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:09]** You only see one splash as Julius hits the water and just, like... Yeah, he's a ghost.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Yeah, there's just a splash.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:16]** and you're able to grab the possum and get it to safety.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** I won't make you roll for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Thank God.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** This only further solidifies my argument that Julius isn't real and is just a figment of Zoa's imagination.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** Zoa jumps in, Julius jumps in, we only see one splash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** That's a good point.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** That is a good point.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** But the possums are real, okay.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** The possums.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:44]** When I touched that possum, it felt rather hard, like a log.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** I don't know.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:47]** I mean, the possums are the friends we made along the way, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yes.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** That old phrase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Yeah.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** That old turn of phrase.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** All right.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:58]** Well, it looks like we have lost our way to get up river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:22]** so we're gonna need a little bit more of that yeah ingenuity right so julius i think you would remember that one of the maps you saw in the office um could tell you where the water meter was like it's not a secret her house is like a

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:45]** it's just a house in the woods she's got a couple billboards along i-80 yeah right so like you could very easily just walk along either along the road or through the woods to get right there all right boy i mean just don't turn off for the largest ball of twine or the thing right yeah defies all human logic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:46 - 00:19:03]** Look, I think between me and, if you all remember that map that we saw in Pa's office, I think we can find our way there pretty quickly, and especially with the help of Clemmie and Zoa's way guiding.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** I think we'll be all right.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** It's getting a little late, though, in the day.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** I don't know that we want to be walking here at night.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Or do we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:19]** I do have a camp, or we could stay here in my literal treehouse, actually, now that I think about it.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** I'm sure we can make some room for you.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:29]** I'll make sure the animals are kind to you, too, and don't scratch your eyes out at night or anything like that.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** I mean, you met the possums, but there are other ones.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** What do you say we camp for the night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** Is it full dark?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** Is it evening now?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** It's evening.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** It was three o'clock when you pulled up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:49]** I'd say between it capsizing and rescuing possum, it's probably 4.30, 5 o'clock.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** The sun's dipped.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** You don't have much time.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** It's going to be a few hours to get to the watermander's place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** What season is it?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** What time of year is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** It's the summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** Oh, so it won't get dark until like 8 o'clock.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** We're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** Well, you do bring up a good point there, Ira.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** We could get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** Could we just hustle and try to get there quickly?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Sure.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** And efficiently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** We could try.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:26]** I'm personally fine with it, but as though I just want to let you know that around dusk, things do get kind of weird in these parts.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** They do.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** So you have a higher likelihood of encountering some weird shit.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** I'll just put it that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** Sounds great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Yeah.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** As long as you have a bag of wrenches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Yeah.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:43]** I've got an unlimited supply of tools to chuck.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:49]** Also, every, like you say weird s***, I say opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:53]** You never abandoned the forest before, have you, Ira Murphy?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Not a whole lot.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** I mostly stick around people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Yeah.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:03]** Well, maybe we'll have an opportunity and Amanda will have a couple extra opportunities.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** So are we heading out there?

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** If we make it to the Mander, then I'm... We best be moving directly.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** Cole, you're always pushing us ahead.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** I appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:22]** I need you to stay here and manage the place and heal up and take care of yourself.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** Good boy.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** Thank you, Julius, for saving him.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Alright, I'll pack up what I need.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Julius, fist bumps Cletus.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** You stay away from Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:37]** I appreciate it, but I don't want you working on my possum right now.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I was asking...

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** You got that hammer?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** I seem to be a hammer liar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** I mean, I'll roll a sleight of hand if I need to.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** I take the hammer that I stole and I want to put it back in his stuff without him noticing.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** All right.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:06]** Alright, that is a 12, but I am trained in all tasks involving manual dexterity, such as stealing, performing sleight of hand, and lockpicking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** Is the defense for it intellect?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Or is it speed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** What was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Is there a defense for it?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Like an opposing role?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Yeah, roll intellect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** You definitely pass.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I rolled a 3.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Nice!

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** My mistake, I reckon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** No harm, no foul.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Nobody caught this to the head, is that what we're saying?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Not yet.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Don't you be piddling in my tools, you hear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:46]** If we run into the supposed weird shit that comes out at dusk, I might have to quickly snag a hammer and throw it at an enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** Okay.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** So you're, you're making your way straight to the watermander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Yes.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:54]** Like we were huffing it too, you know, let's push it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Y'all are hustling as fast as you can.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** You get there.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** We'll say it's about eight, about eight o'clock.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** It's a, it's a long journey, like several miles.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** But you make it there as the sun's going down.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:15]** You get to the edge of the woods where it starts to clear onto her property and

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:25]** And all you can hear is the din of this rushing, angry river, far angrier than you've ever seen it before.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:32]** You can see that her house is where you would have expected it to be on the land.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:38]** It's actually sort of inverted where there's a dock and her home is over the river on stilts.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:48]** Sorry, so we're seeing the river, like right at the tree line, we're seeing the river and there's like a floodplain around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** So there's tree line, bit of grass, and the start of the dock.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:59]** Dock goes out about 30 feet to her home that's on stilts over the river.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** You're seeing the river going absolutely crazy.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:10]** Okay, so we've got to, like, walk on, like, a plank walkway to cross the river to get to her house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Basically, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Okay, well, let's go knock on the door.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** That's the polite thing to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** I'll be the one to knock and talk to you if you want.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** A talking-based character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** Give me a marching order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** I guess I wrote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** I'll follow up.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** I'm assuming that I'm near the front for this excursion, I suppose.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Or I'll go after Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:39]** Ira, Cole, Zoe, Julius?

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** Yep.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** Cool.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Ira, make a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:54]** I don't have a speed edge, so I guess it's just what I rolled on the die.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** I have 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:12]** So as you step over the river from the shore, you notice one of the hand-shaped water elements reach up and try to beat you off of this planked walkway.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** This planked walkway.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:22]** You were able to roll Dodge out of the way, but you hear what sounds like a voice in the wind.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:27]** Why did you take her?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** Bring her back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** Why did you take my friend?

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:38]** Now, I've stolen lots of things in my life, but I didn't steal anyone's friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** And all four of you heard that.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:45]** Julius is going to use mystical sense to...

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:54]** Well, no, that's not... It says you can sense whether there's something mystical or magical going on in situations, whereas presence is not obvious.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** This is pretty obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** So, I'm just going to retract that.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Yep.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** You can detect magic, and yep, there's magic.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** We saw the magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** Well, that's not terrifying at all.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** Julius, do you have any sense of what this is?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** I mean, you're an otherworldly being at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** My eyes see what you'll see right here at this time.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** I don't have quite that piercing thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Yeah, of course, of course.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:27]** And let's take a wild guess as to whether it passes or not.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** I'm going to guess not.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** So it's basically a seven.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** With my edge.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** Wow.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Well, not basically.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** It is a seven.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** It's essentially a seven.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** One might say technically, in fact, a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:49]** I'm going to pause the game real quick because I think we might be misusing edge.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** An edge is not a plus to your die roll.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** That's one fewer effort you have to spend.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** It's one fewer from your pool you have to spend to use those resources.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Okay, I got a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Okay.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Cool.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:16]** Well, the river hits you in the chest so hard, and I'm actually going to make a GM intrusion here.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:25]** You're not only hitting the chest and taking three might damage...

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:31]** you, um, are knocked prone on this walkway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Well, hopefully someone can drag me away.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I'm now down to six might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** That's the bad news.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** The good news is you get an XP and you get to give an XP to your friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** All right.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** How many XP do I get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** You get one, you get one to give away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** You get an XP and you get an XP.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** Uh, let, let's give one to, um, uh,

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** Let's give one to Julius because he did save Cletus, even though he's trying to make moves on him now.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Nice, nice, nice.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** What do you do next?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I mean, Julius.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** Well, I'm knocked prone, so I don't really know.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** I guess he's just going to like, oh, I guess I could just try to get up.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** You're in between Cole and Ira, right?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Yeah.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** I think Cole will try to help him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:18]** That's uncomfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:21]** And he just tries to get up.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:25]** And he sees Cole come to help him and puts his hand up to be assisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** So this river has spoken to you.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** The river has attacked you.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** What are you trying to do?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** Trying to get out.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Okay.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:33]** Is there a way we can communicate back with this river?

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** Let it know we're in no harm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:40]** I'll do that when I can stand and think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** I think it might be good to push on and see if we can get inside the house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** Let's get to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Best to keep a cool head in situations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** I'm not super familiar with the action economy here, but I do believe that I'm up now, I suppose.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** And, yeah.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Best not be loafing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** Y'all are making a run for the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Are we close?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** I thought we were 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** First five feet.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** It's close enough that you could all get there in one action.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** You run to the door.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** Each of you run inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** We just run and barge in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** Presumably.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Are you going to wait to ring the doorbell?


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** I mean, I was going to run up and just frantically beat on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:37]** So as you run up to beat on the door, you notice that the door is not there.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** There is not.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Okay.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:51]** It's almost as if a creature larger than the doorway just walked through and left a Kool-Aid man shaped like... Oh.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Oh, no.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** So you could just go right in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:02]** Yeah, if he sees that, he wouldn't stop and try to knock on an imaginary door.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:09]** Just run through, try to, I don't know, I'm imagining an action movie.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:19]** He runs and when he gets to the threshold of the door, just leaps to get as far in as he can so his allies can get in the door without him obstructing the path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** That's some Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** Something's been through here.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** Must have snatched up the water, man, I imagine.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Maybe that's who the river's mourning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** That's what I'm wondering.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:39]** Can I do a... Let me see if I can think through what might I call something like this.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** Can I do, like, an understanding...

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:54]** magic maybe benny to like know what kind of a creature would it cause a hole shaped like this um yeah give me give me an understanding magic check okay

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:58]** And again, I'm trained so that... You're specialized, actually.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** I'm specialized.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** And what does that do for me again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** It eases the roll by two levels.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** So whatever number I have in my head goes down by six.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:14]** I have not the faintest idea as I rolled a four.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:41]** jesus christ could could i try it um let's i'm trained and i have a an edge of one in intellect um you could try it and apply effort okay i mean you could try it by itself but like you can the thing is you can apply effort to just about anything it just costs three points two for you because you have the edge right uh okay yeah i'll do that okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** That's another 17 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Awesome.

**[00:31:46 - 00:32:04]** So, Ira, you would know, you would intuit as a sage, your magical research would have told you that you can, in fact, communicate with these elements.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:34]** one and two this thing that's stepped into like you would recognize bits of the outline as something that's sort of like wears other people's bodies as like skin and like layers them on top of themselves but like that's all that you can remember of this creature great


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:38]** Skinwalker, whatever it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:42]** Can I... So I'll give you those two things for a 17, because that was a pretty good roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Okay.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** This is terrible.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:52]** There's some kind of crazy skin killer thing that busted the door down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:53 - 00:33:00]** Can I look and see if I can sense that there has been... I may be about to answer that question.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** So as you...

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:30]** like start looking around catching your breath from getting away from the water um you notice that uh there's signs of struggle in here that there's like shelves and bottles smashed um you know they're like what what look like whip marks on some of the furnishings um give me a perception task uh each and every one of you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** How do we roll that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Perception.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** If you have the skill for perception, you would use it.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** If not, it's a straight up intellect roll.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** You can apply effort if you want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Cole rolled a 13.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** I'm going to apply effort.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** I have one edge.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** But I got a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Hell, I can beat all of that.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** I got a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Ira got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Okay.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Hooray.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:05]** So, it sounds like each of you are checking different areas of her home.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:15]** Cole, you're looking in her bedroom, in her closet, and you find a cipher, a charm on a red thread.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Okay.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:25]** Julius, you're checking around her, I guess not her outdoor bathroom, but we have indoor plumbing in the 20s, right?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** I hope.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** We do in this alternate universe anyway.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:37]** You're in her bathroom and you find a wooden handle brush that you sense some magical power from.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:45]** Ira, you're looking around on bookshelves and you find a card with two moths on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** A card?

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** A card.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Like a greeting card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Yeah, like a tarot card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** It's a credit card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Yeah, you find her social security card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Yes!

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** Mission complete.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** What?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** This wasn't invented for another 35 years.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Cletus brought it with him from the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Love it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** Would I know anything about the mods on the card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Is that an indicator of something?

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** Do you guys want to take some time and figure out what these things are?

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** You can tell that they're powerful, but you can't quite figure out what they are.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** For sure.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** So, Kohl's is a Charm of Reversal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Charm of Reversal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:38]** To use it, you wear it around your neck, and the next time you're attacked, the charm protects you from damage and attempts to inflict it back upon your attacker instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Uno reverse.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:05]** He's like, look, my whole life I've been obsessed with magic.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:12]** I have a lot of knowledge and interest in magic, but for the life of me, I cannot do it myself.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:17]** So anytime I can find ciphers or magical items, I know a lot about them.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:20]** I can figure out what they do and maybe use them, but

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:25]** He's like, in Harry Potter, a squib, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** Like, he knows people around him can do magic, and he can't, and it pisses him off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Yep.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** It's tragic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** I surely hope so.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** But this card is pretty amazing.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** It'll provide us some much-needed defense if we're attacked again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Mm.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** That is useful.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:57]** I believe this brush here will let me know the true name and understanding of something.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** So I'm thinking about using it on Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** On Cletus?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Where?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** Just keep a reasonable distance.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Cole, what do you find?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** He's mine, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** I wrote a 15 on Sliderhand to steal Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** He's not even here.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** He stole Zoe's heart.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** I'm kidding.
