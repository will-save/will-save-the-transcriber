**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Won't Save is an actual play podcast of the horror RPG Old Guns of Appalachia and contains content that may be disturbing to some listeners.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:11]** The stories and events depicted are fictional and intended for mature audiences only.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:13]** Listener discretion is advised.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:18]** Hello, family.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:22]** Gather round and let me tell y'all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:28]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollows and the

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:30]** whose tale has yet to be told.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:34]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:44]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper on the wind.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:50]** Hanks and boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the pickin'.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:55]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:04]** Welcome to Wantsafe, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Well, hey there, family.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:20]** I'm your invisible GM, Vinny Rodriguez, joined by Kelly Gilliam, John Swan, Will Garrett, and Heath Parker of STF.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** STF!

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** Every bit of that applause is for Heath.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Heath, we were actually just gushing about you.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Thank you.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:39]** And your talent for listening well and moving scenes forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:42]** I feel like I'm good at one of those things.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:46]** The listening well, I don't think I'm as good at.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:50]** But once I get into it, then I have a good time.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** We're having a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** We're having a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** You done, bro.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** I'm having good times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** Also, now I'm just picturing gushers, but with Heath's face on them.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Who?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Gushers?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Like the snack?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** Yeah, like the... With the candy thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** Oh, yeah, because we gushed about them.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** I mean, gushers are pretty good.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:18]** That's kind of like nightmare feel, like gushers that are shaped based on my head, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:23]** If you do an STF edition of Gushers, that would be kind of cool, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:27]** Yeah, when we get that big deal Gushers sponsorship, we'll work on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** Yeah, who owns Gushers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** They also own Fruit Roll-Ups.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Oh, it's General Mills.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** General Mills, call us.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:47]** Everything they make is like a thing that you could eat slowly, but you never do because you just want to shove it entirely in your mouth like right at once, which I feel like is a compliment to what they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** I actually like what they're like candy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I had a Pavlovian response.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** My mouth and my eyes both started watering.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:01]** I got the super sour Gushers from TikTok shop.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:07]** And so if you haven't seen those ads, they're Gushers, but they're tossed in fruit-flavored citric acid.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** And they are the most sour thing I've ever had in my life.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** And so naturally, I finished two containers of them.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** But I can't even think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Is your mouth raw?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** I'm sweating just thinking about these Gushers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:44]** they're so good that's an interesting thing about humans it's like there are plants and things in the world that have evolved over millions of years to prevent things from eating them and humans are the one species that are like challenge accepted i'm gonna eat this recreationally uh-huh and for money possibly right that's true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:44 - 00:04:07]** yep capsaicin and implants um puffer fish like literally developed venom poison in their spines and humans are like i think we can we can just cut out the part that we don't like this that's fine yeah that's fine it's fine do you guys like spicy food cool i love it oh i could eat it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:11]** I don't like the, like, super insane-o.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** Like, I've gotten all the hot ones, like, sauces.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Some of them are good.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Some of them, I'm not so great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** Right, but you're not into Da Bomb or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** I'm not into Da Bomb, but I do like the dab.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** The last dab's actually really nice.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** What is Da Bomb?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** The triple X one, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** Da Bomb is, like, one of the hottest sauces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** And it's like a... It's just like this...

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** I don't know how to... It's almost like sand.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** It's like hot sand in your mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** You're really selling it, Will.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** I mean, to bomb is not what I would gravitate towards, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:05:16]** the the the other hot ones are pretty awesome i've never had the hot ones but now i have done the hot ones uh it it is some of them like yeah i think i know where will's coming from because like some of them are really hot but there's nothing else except the hotness so it's not really fun yeah but i guess it's not supposed to be fun it's supposed to be just like you know see how far you can fuck yourself up yeah and still live yeah so honestly i try it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** don't like sand.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** It's coarse and rough and it gets everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** It's like molten.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Unlike who's soft and warm and cuddly.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Soft, warm hot sauce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Yeah.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:38]** You know, John, the taco spot with the fish tacos with the habanero?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** That's spicy and it is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** I really like habanero in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:44 - 00:06:11]** yeah i've got like a mango habanero hot sauce mango always good it's really good i've been crushing a lot of different types of chili oil on almost all of my meals and that smokiness is like unbelievable i need to make some chili oil because like i see videos on like youtube shorts and tiktok and stuff all the time of people like making amazing looking chili oil and i have never


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:16]** Do you just roast crushed red flakes in oil?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Is that it?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Is that the whole recipe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** No, there's more to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** You throw some sand in there at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Sand, yeah.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** So it's got a nice coarseness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** At least 10% sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** And then you put it everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** In all the cracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** And then you feed it not just to the men, but to the women and the children, too.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** Yep.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:58]** Yeah, so you use chopped garlic, szechuan, peppercorns, whole red chilies, chili flakes, Korean chili flakes, whatever oil you use, grapeseed oil a lot of the time, star anise, bay leaves.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** How does one select the oil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:06]** Are they looking for high melting point, like boiling point?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:10]** Or are you looking for viscosity, would you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** I don't know.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** I've never made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** We'll find out.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** Well, I'll just go on Reddit.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** Or maybe you can chime in our Discord, everyone, on how to make chili oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** Yeah.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Let us know.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** We'll sidebar that for later.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:41]** Because there's some really good stuff that I found at H Mart that I also found online.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** And maybe I can send it to you.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** We're pivoting to a cooking podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** I'm seeing... We could very easily make that happen.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** I just want to call out real quick.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:56]** Before we put hot sauce to bed, that... You know how you normally buy hot sauce and it's like a small container?

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:01]** Or maybe you get like the big, you know, like Cholula or like Tapatio, right?

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Like Sriracha, yeah.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Sriracha is a great example.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** There's this...

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:36]** dave's gourmet original hot sauce on amazon called insanity and it comes in a one gallon jug and i just want to know who needs one gallon it's like a big bottle of frank's red hot oh man yeah oh yeah that i want to meet that person yeah who's consuming one of these i want to meet their plumber does it come with a pump do you think or does it just like you just slather it on yeah i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** It's like bagged wine.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** You just have a pump on the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** You just play slap the bag with it, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Slap the bag?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** What?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:55]** I mean, I've never played that game, but I've played Tour de Francia when the Tour de France is going around.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:20]** oh my god that's always fun again what is that you hang bags for each waypoint on the tour to france and you have to do like a pull and that's your time until like the highest time wins that's awesome wow and of course you can like if you could i mean this is crazy don't no one should drink this much

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** especially Franzia.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** But yeah, if you empty the bag, you take a penalty.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:32]** So you don't want to drink too much of one and like preload it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** What am I supposed to do?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** Immediately responds by justifying as though we're the most logical thing in the world.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** Well, that does sound very logical.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** So, yes, you may.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Are you going to actually mow your lawn?

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:56]** Or are you going to do your usual psycho stuff that you do with those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** Yeah, I'm building a racing lawnmower.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:05]** And I really appreciate the help with building it.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:18]** Or would it actually sound like... Yeah.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** Because it's possum-powered?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** I'll lend you my possums.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:28]** Wait, didn't we establish last time that they're not actually possums, but they're like statues of possums?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:33]** We established that you think it could be that, but I needed them to be possums, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** I think I need it.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Okay, okay.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** It's like a little pin.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** I hope I can keep this going.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** I rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** I have the exact opposite because I got a 6.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Oh my god, I got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Oh no.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** I got a 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Round two.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Will and Kelly.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Let's go.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** I think Kelly, you start this one.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Yeah.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Yeah.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Yeah.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** Hey, neighbor.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:12]** Can you let the possum that I lent you out of your closet, please?

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** Because I really need Cletus back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:19]** Yeah, Cletus has been great.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:23]** He's been organizing my closet just nonstop.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** That's why I like him.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** I think he took some of my hats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** Well, I put him on.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** I lent him to you, but I need him to organize my shit now.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:41]** And I also have these hats that he has discovered, and I'll give them to you as payment for getting my fucking possum back.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Certainly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Yeah.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** We probably messed that one up, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** Fancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** This is improv.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** There is no messing it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** There's not at all.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** All right.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Let's roll low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** And roll them up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** Tell me you've got loaded dice without telling me you've got loaded dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** I just got these off team moves, so maybe they are.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** I can switch to the... I got a natural 20.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** I got a 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** I got a 14.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I'm switching over.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I'm re-rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I'm not rolling above the 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** You can do it.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:37]** yeah i've i've rolled single digits every single time all right i got a six this time i rolled with why am i oh no sorry i won't make you do another one after this kelly but the dice have spoken i just feel like other people should go yeah all right i'll go first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Hi there.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:54]** Yeah, I would like to have the Johnny Mansville sandwich, but the thing is that I want my roast beast cut in perfect squares, and then also make sure that you only put the mayonnaise on one side of the sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Got it, sure.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** Would you like some ketchup on the other side of the sandwich, as per tradition here at Squaresville, the Burger Playhouse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:08]** I'm sorry, but I actually... The Burger Playhouse!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** I actually thought that... You get free admission to our ball pit.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Balls McKenzie's send right over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Please be sure to leave a review.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** I would absolutely love that.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:27]** The thing is that I don't know that I have enough Playhouse points in order to get the ketchup on the other side because right now my parents have said that I can only have mayonnaise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Young man, let me tell you something.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:34]** Today you are in luck because for every purchase you get an extra 200 Playhouse points.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** Get in the play pit!

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** I'll give you the sandwich there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:38 - 00:16:03]** and scene solid what happens in the play pit we don't talk about what happens in the play pit we don't we don't know what happened okay food and it doesn't have to be creepy that's right sit there in the balls cool we're gonna roll this up one more time and then we'll move right on all right three two one go 15 yeah

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** Nice.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Will, what?

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** I got a four.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** I got a 17.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** I got a 15, yeah.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** Okay.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Well, hi there, neighbor.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** Can I borrow a toaster strudel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:28]** Yeah, once again, you're feeding toaster strudels to your pet platypus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:37]** No, sadly, my platypus passed away, but my swans, they really love throwing them at passersby.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** Beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** Beautiful story.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:49]** I love in the fiction this is a man who has a pet platypus and multiple pet swans.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Of course.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** What is this person's life?

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** I want to write a novel now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:59]** It's like the aviary slash weird mammal Tiger King.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:09]** Is this the same person who's starting a racing lawn mowing league and also is having a possum clean their closet and is the parents of the child who went to Burger Playhouse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** The answer could be no, but I think it is yes.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** I think that's right.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** The answer could be no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:41]** the most unrealistic thing though is i feel like i feel like those swans would eat those you're gonna throw them at like pastors by i don't buy it i don't buy it that's that's the it doesn't have opposable thumbs how's it gonna throw just long neck that with their just like face with pure rage yeah look swans like geese i whip my head back and forth i whip my head back and are they as assholes as geese yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:41 - 00:18:09]** there it is that's what i was thinking i love it that swine put some torque on that oh my goodness well thanks for that game that was that was that was fun yeah thank you guys for playing yeah should we play another game maybe one a little more the real this game for us mysterious mysterious it was a dark and stormy now

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:22]** Previously on Old Gods, we learned a little bit about the Legrands and their source of their business and any influence in the town.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:32]** The group survived a fistfight with a white thing and learned that Cole Ward is a straight badass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:39]** He might be pretty, he might be tough, but he's pretty dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** Yeah.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** But he is pretty tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** The most impressive meathead in all of Appalachian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:48]** He might not be smart, but he's strong and he's dumb.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** I thought that you were just going to leave it at, he might not be smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:58]** Anyway, moving on.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:02]** Too much of that mountain ripple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** Out of, like, lead cups.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Yeah.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:14]** We learned that Zoa's... We learned that Zoa's familiar is an Allegheny Dusky Salamander.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** What's its name?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** Preach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:23]** Her name is Clementine, but you can also call her Clemmie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:26]** She did two damage against the white thing.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** She did.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Same.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** She almost... I did zero damage.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** She almost what?

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** What was that?

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** What was that?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** Nothing.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** What did you say about her?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** Wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** This is my salamander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** I didn't want to tip my cards.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** Do something weird.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Something mysterious.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** We'll see.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** Maybe.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** Or we won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** Something mysterious.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Dark side.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** Something, something complete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:04]** So we left our colleagues after fighting the white thing heading to Zoa Green's possum-powered boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** That's right.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** We're on our way there, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Does this boat have a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Oh, it's Possum Palace.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** Are we at the treehouse now?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Are we at Zoa's place?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Are we still lost?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** I thought we were still in the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:46]** you're in the woods making your way to to the possum palace okay all right cool that but on banjo i'm sure i can find a plug-in for that how are you all feeling after after that uh cole you okay i'm i'm feeling a bit tired but i could keep going of course let's get moving there's critters like that around


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Wadametta might be in a heap of trouble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I imagine that we're walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** Clemmie, come here, girl.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** He tucks her in his little coat.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:09]** I thought there was a promise of topping me off with some might, because I'm a little spent from that fight.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:27]** an unintentional rhyme but my friends i'm sure will help me someone uh guaranteed that uh someone was gonna tie me up who was it oh in time how about when we get back to the uh how about when we get to the boston battle say and we're on the river yeah i mean i can heal you was somebody else gonna heal you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** Well, keep in mind that we have the recovery rolls that you can do.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** There's one action.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** I was going to do that.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Ten minutes, one hour, ten hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Okay, let's do that.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Bonus.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** When you do it, I forget which...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:41 - 00:22:03]** yeah generous allies who spent the last day with you add one to their recovery rolls nice okay well that will do that will do i am just nicely oh okay i'm gonna use an action then to do a recovery roll okay do we all do this at the same time or just one person do it for everyone so just whenever you want to right yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** We're going to take a half second to talk about recovery rolls one more time.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:12]** So recovery rolls in OGOA, you have them for a given day.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** You can make your first one in a single action.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** So if you're in the middle of a fight and you want to take an action to recover, you can roll your recovery die.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Your next one takes 10 minutes.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Your third one takes one hour.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** So probably couldn't do that in combat, but you could think of them like short rests.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:30]** And then your fourth one has to be a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:34]** I did a 5 plus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:39]** Do you have a plus 1 in your box?

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** Yeah, I do indeed.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:47]** Then it would be plus 2 because then you get an extra 1 from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:52]** And we can spend those points wherever we want, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** Yes, you can use those to recover whatever pool you want.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** You just can't go above your pool maximum.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Cool.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** What time of day is it, Finn?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** I mean, we've been pretty busy.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** I imagine this is early afternoon.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** So I'd say around 3 o'clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** We have been busy, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:15]** The sun is going... It's not getting darker yet, but it has passed.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** Zoa would look up and know that the sun is going down and not coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:29]** Let's just say that we probably don't want to be in here at nightfall, so we should rest up, patch up, and get out of here and get to the palace.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** Absolutely.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** How's everyone's health doing?

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Mine's a little...

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:41]** A little worn down, but I just want to make sure if any of you all need some healing or help from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** I'm okay.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:56]** If I had to classify it in numerical terms, I would say that the pool of intelligence that I have is too lower than it normally is at maximum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:05]** If we were to extrapolate that further, I'd say I'm five less than where I am at maximum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:11]** Well, I'd say that I'm feeling mighty unmindful and might need to focus on healing myself.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:18]** So he does that and brings his pool from three to nine, which is nowhere near the top, but it's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** What's your maximum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Oh, it's 12.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:22]** I guess it's somewhat near the top.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** 12 is max.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Yeah, mine's 10.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** Mine's pretty low, so...

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** Why is he so strong?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** It doesn't make any sense.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Oh, whatever.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:37]** Because you need to be strong when you're out there walking through the woods, portaging canoes and carrying stuff.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** But he also has 12 speed and 12 intellect.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Is he just amazing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** How is that possible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** I think he's just an all-rounder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:47]** I didn't go through this process, but do you roll for it or do you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** No, it just comes that way.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:53]** It was my predetermined pool for whatever reason.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:55]** You said you've got 10, 12, 12?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** I have 12.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:00]** Yeah, at the moment I have 9, 12, 12, but at max I'm like 12, 12, 12.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** I don't know why.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** When you eat mushrooms all day, every day.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** You're good.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Off the ground of the forest.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, your body's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:22]** I took 10 minutes to rest, which is interesting as a ghost, because I feel like I can feel pain and I can see it happening, but the two things feel like they're different.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** I don't know quite what that means yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Cool.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:33]** So we've taken time to rest, and are we going to keep going to the palace?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Yeah, let's keep going to the palace.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Clemmy, help me navigate here.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** I'm a little worn down.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** Clemmy just points with her tongue, and then we're moving through the woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:43]** Make an intellect roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** Sorry, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** To find your way back, because there's a well-worn path.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** You just got lost on it.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** So give me an intellect roll.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** This is what got us into this problem in the first place, was doing an intellect roll, like trying to get there.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** You want me to do that again?

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Yeah.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** I have 12 intellect.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Let's just say I... Ah, damn it.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** All right, what am I rolling?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** 20 again, as always.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** Don't do this to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** Is he just guiding because he's the boat driver?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** I told you not to do this.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** No, Clemmy's guiding.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** I told you not to do this.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:19]** I roll very high in stupid improv games where I don't want to play.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** And then I roll horribly in this actual game.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** It's poetic.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** Now you fight a red thing that just pops out of the fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** Make a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** How do we do defense rolls?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** Just... Nine to nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:45]** Okay, you dash out of the way as a tree topples over and crashes down next to you.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** Oh, thank God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Alright.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** So we will continue along to the Possum Palace, hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Julius, was that you?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** No.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** You know... Julius, you trying to kill me?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** I'm not that eager to bring you all over to the side.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** I'm not eager either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:11]** Ira's like, they avoided my trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** Now I have to take their stuff while they're alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** So, do you need help navigating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:40]** it's fine just just hold my hand would just hold my hand and make any speed rolls and and and and other kinds of rolls for me as we navigate through wait i can't even hold your hand no all right his body is physical you can hold it just very cool cool let's do it let's all touch and then let's just move forward one of you please help him yeah i'll each each and every one of you make an intellect roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** I was going to ask, do we need to have a special ability to track things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:49]** I just thought it made sense for Zoe to have the... Because I've got dope intellect.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** I have geology, but that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** Oh, you're trained in mapping, Zoe.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** So that should actually... But you rolled a one.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** So, never mind.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** That doesn't help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** So, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** I rolled a 13.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I got a 12.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** Well, there's a path that he wore down as you've moved out.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** So someone else navigate the path.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** We best stick to that path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Yeah.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** I'm going to guess that you and Cole have been out here once or twice.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** You took Cole fishing or something.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** Does Cole like to fish?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Yeah.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** I believe he has a fishing rod with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** Zoa and Cole went fishing once or twice.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** And so Cole is able to navigate back to this path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Actually, I have a fishing outfit.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** It doesn't say I have a rod, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Me and Cole going fishing in the dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** Using my rod because you didn't bring one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Sensual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:46]** Sometimes you just got to get away from the wives and come out and fish with other men just in the middle of the lake.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** You know what I mean?

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Use their rods.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** All right.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** It's just you borrowing your best friend's rod.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** There's nothing wrong with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** Nothing funny about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Cole, do you remember how to get there?

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:11]** We've done this a couple of times and I have a past somewhere, but I can't see too well right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:14]** Yeah, the creek turns back by the old stone road, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** You lead the way, please, please.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Awesome.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** So Cole leads you back to the path.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:24]** You turn left because you got lost on the north side of this path, and you make your way out toward the river.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:37]** As you're walking down, you start to see the silhouette of what could be a person and kind of hear footsteps coming towards you.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:43]** As you make your way down the path and you get closer to this individual, you can see that it's a person.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** It's a man.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** It's a relatively young man.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:51]** He's by all appearances about 19 years old and he's carrying a crate.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** What do you do?

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Do you talk to him?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Do you just let him by?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:27]** kill him kill him steal from his corpse loot the bodies there's not a body not yet not yet there's still time for that Julius starts walking around because he knows that or he thinks but he probably can't see him so he starts walking around him to uh just kind of take in his outfit his stance his demeanor um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:34]** So he's light afoot, but otherwise in great shape.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** There's the crate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Does it look like he's straining to carry it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** No, he's carrying it pretty handily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** What size of a crate again?

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Yeah, what shape is it generally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** It's generally rectangular, as crates are.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Like a coffin?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** No, like a shipping container.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** But like a small one.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** A shipping container?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:05]** He's carrying a 53-square tractor trailer.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** It's a ton!

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Like a box.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** You can hear the tinkling of glass bumping together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:21]** Cole's going to come out and be like, had a friend?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** which haul them through these parts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:27]** And as you step out, you recognize this person as, uh, Jesse Coleman.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:45]** Um, Jesse is one of your, uh, as you would say, a, um, transportation specialist in your enterprise of, um, you know, illicit goods staying, staying, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:54]** Staying a beat ahead of the law?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** Yeah, afternoon there, Mr. Ward.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** I didn't expect to see you out here.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** Always dodging, ducking, and diving.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** You know me.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Yeah.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:29]** dip dodge dive yeah yeah just grabbing this crate and heading back up to langley to drop it off nice i'm gonna throw a wrench at him it's so violent it hits him in the temple he falls down and starts bleeding out now there's a bomb oh my god steal his shit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** He's going to Langley, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** My plan's coming together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** He was on the path to help us.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** He could give us info.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Is he dead?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** He comes to after a few seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Ira!

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Get out!

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** What are you doing there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Sorry.

**[00:32:53 - 00:33:01]** We just encountered some foul creature up in these woods, and our, I suppose, is a bit gun-happy.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Well, not gun, but you know what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** I wish I had a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Yeah, I wish you didn't.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Zola hides his gun behind his back.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** It's hard to do.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** It's pretty big.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:18]** So he starts to sit up.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** We do apologize about that, young man.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Did you say you were headed up to Langley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Yeah, that's where this here crate was headed.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:33]** We've got the coat rack, as we call it, over at the General Store.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** And we've got something similar up in Langley.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** You know that, Mr. Ward.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** You're their main supplier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:42]** Who are you meeting up with in Langley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Who am I meeting up with?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:48]** Man, that head wound has really done a neighbor on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** Yeah, I do apologize.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** I'm headed up to... We had been set upon by beasts, so I'm jumpy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** I guess I can understand that.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** I ain't setting upon nobody, Mr. Who are you?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** Let me record it down into my notes so I can shank you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Utranius McGee.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** That got many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:41]** okay okay it's to meet uh yeah i'm headed up to to meet miss jolene she's got she's got a little business up there you know you've jolene and i heard uh is she she working with the company up there heard anything about them you know i've i've heard plenty of talk about that that lc and ncs and i think that's what they call it up there they're

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Trying to build that dam, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** That's what I heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:52]** I mean, the dam should be fine, and I guess it might bring some business to town, but they sure haven't gone about it the right way.

**[00:34:53 - 00:35:01]** There's all sorts of folks in LC&C uniforms, roughing up townsfolk and doing whatever they can to make sure that dam gets built.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Yeah, that's what I heard as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** There's all this talk about it, you know, making the river sweep the town away.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** And I don't believe all of it.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** But, you know, there might be something to it.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** If there were something to it, we ought to speak.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** I mean, shouldn't we find out?

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Yeah, we should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:28]** You should ask who's the head of maybe the people who disagree with Langley Court coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** Yeah, do you know anybody who's...

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:37]** A bit louder than the rest of the company town folk who are probably on the payroll.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:42]** But do you know anyone who might be looking to put a...

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** Put a wrench in their plan, so to speak.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** You might want to hit them upside the head with a wrench.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** I'll put a wrench to them now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** We know, Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** We know.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:05]** I mean, it seemed as if, and this is crazy talk, but it seemed as if up until about a day ago, the river itself had been fighting this dam.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** But something happened.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It seems to have calmed down.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:12]** I wonder, you know, maybe those bedtime stories had something to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** What do you mean, river fighting the dam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** I mean, if I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't believe it.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:25]** But, you know, I've seen water throw these men around as if it had some bad intent.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:35]** You know, reaching up with almost hands to pull them down under the water and, you know, breaking up wood that's been sound for years.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Crazy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:45]** Tossing men around with ill intent, that sounds, well, mighty, mighty shocking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** Yeah, I mean, some say this river has a mind of its own, but I don't know.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** I don't believe in all of that folk magic stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:00]** But you saw the river grow hands and throw people around, but you don't believe in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** I've seen the river pull people under.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** I mean, I'm sure you've seen that happen in rapids before, too.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:15]** You know, if I trust what I've seen with my head, you know, I've been known to sample a bit of Mr. Ward's wares as time goes on.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** It could have just been that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:24]** I never drank no shine that made me see water reaching up from its river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** That's more Zoa's area of purview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** I've been up and down that river many a time.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:36]** I have seen hands reach up, as it were, from the water.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** Have you seen it sober?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:44]** I do not consume alcohol.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** I only consume the fruit of the forest.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Thank you.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** That's a real good question, you trainee.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** What kind of fruit of the forest are we talking about?

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:18]** all the fruits to the forest she bears many fruits for you let's just let's just get to the we we really got to find this watermander we're losing daylight this waterman who's that i mean no you should get out if you're a young man just don't stay here late at night julius floats the rest of our bit uh well they got me in a whole mess of it uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:37]** i tell you what you you keep your powder dryer about this this whole langley stuff when you're up there no we're heading up that way too eventually i imagine yeah maybe we'll see cross paths again all right i'll mind my p's and my q's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** And watch out for wrenches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** All right, Mr. Utranius.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** That's good advice in these woods, apparently.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** You gotta learn to dodge.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Ain't no count.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** Duck, dip, dive, and dodge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** And dodge.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Oh, Skyrim NPC.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** And he picks up his crate.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Just like hit him upside the head and he just moves on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Yeah, oh well, it must be nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** Teeter-totters along and walks off down the path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** That was a very confusing young man.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:14]** First he tells us he sees the rivers grow arms, and then he backtracks on it, saying he's drinking moonshine.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** Nothing wrong with that, but...

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** Seemed to be very convicted at first and then doubted himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:26]** Well, sometimes a lot of the things that you see in this world can make you doubt yourself.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** I don't blame him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:34]** Until a few days ago, I couldn't make heads or tails of it all, but now I don't know.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** It's best we find that water, Amanda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** I think so, but keep something in mind.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** I remember that white thing that we fought.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** As do I. Maybe it's just coincidence.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Right.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** Thank you.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** So maybe it's just coincidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, I also remember it.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** It did hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Yeah.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** No, but when we were young, boys, right?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** I remember that.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** And call me crazy.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** Call me crazier than a dog sitting with a cat.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** As they say.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** But I feel like something's after us.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Do they say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** All the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** It's a very old saying in my family.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Very clear.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Never hear the ghost.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** Crazier than a sack full of popcorn.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** Well, for so long.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Well, that's not that crazy.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Yeah, that's the thing.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** All right, we should go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** Wait, weren't you going somewhere with the white thing, though?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:31]** Wait, where are you going with that?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Wait, Julius, hold on.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** What do you mean about the white thing coming back into our lives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** Whatever.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** What do you mean?

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** There's a shadow that seems to be growing over the four of us.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** I don't know if it's coincidence.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** I don't know if it's the stars, but just something to keep your eye out for.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** Try and see if you can see the line between the light and the shadow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:59]** Well, I say that that shadow, that sounds all ominous and stuff.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** I don't like that at all.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** Let's think of this shadow as opportunity.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** We've got this situation going on up in Langley.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:18]** If we can go and remedy said situation, I imagine there would be something of value to the rescuers of a town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** Julius smiles and several of his teeth are missing.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** He's like,

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** I knew I liked you, Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:27]** There's that beautiful smile I was missing.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** It's horrible.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** It's bad.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Gorgeous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** That's exactly what I've been watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Stunning.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Stunning.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Oh, stunning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** The shadow's all the more reason to get out of these woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** This is ominous.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** I'd, I'd call it downright inopportune, but I can't hardly believe it though.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** I reckon I gotta agree with Yara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** Yeah.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** So he, can you lead the way?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** He, he shared all these things about the river doing crazy stuff in earnest.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:10]** Um, but I, he realized midway through that conversation, like he, he was locked in on coal who he trusts because they've got a lot of relationship and then realized what was coming out of his mouth was crazy talk.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** He also probably had a concussion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:20]** I fully didn't expect you to roll with me throwing a wrench at him, but I was like, I love that you did.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Ira's a f***ing menace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** I'm glad we didn't just off this, dude.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:30]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Actions have consequences, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Mind your P's and Q's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:54]** actions also have opportunities that's a that's a good one you clowns okay cool so we continue through the forest and make it all the way to the riverbank you only get lost three more times before we do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:03]** When you do so, you see, like, almost like from those Barney movies where there's just, like, a bunch of, like, weird wooden mechanical stuff, like, moving around.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** You see just, like, different animals, like, powering everything.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:11]** Like, you know, like a raccoon here, like, turning a watermill and stuff like that.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:16]** Zoa goes into the clearing, and he's like, Cletus, get the possum palace ready.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Like, Cletus comes out.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** He's like, I don't care that it's Sunday.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Cletus, get the possums out.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I don't give a fuck.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Please just tell me whatever you need to say to get him out of here.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:30]** And then, like, 12, like, possums just, like, hop out of the treehouse and start, like, running in their nightshirts and whatever to the river.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:37]** You see an actual boat, not, like, a dead log with, like, 12, like, pieces of wood floating around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:43]** See, my headcanon of everything Zoa says is, like, is that real?

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** I don't know.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** He might just be on mushrooms.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:48]** This might be a totally different thing that's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** The fruit of the forest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** The fruit of the forest, excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** It is your faith.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:57]** He sees all that and we get there and it's just like a house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** It's Fight Club.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:05]** Him and Tyler are piloting this boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Julius isn't real.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:12]** He's just a figment of Zoa's imagination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** I'm sorry, that's a spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen Fight Club.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** I haven't seen Fight Club.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** Brand new movie, Fight Club.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Yeah, just hit the streets.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** I mean, it's true, yeah.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** Well, I guess his dad did see him, so you know that he's not just a figment of your imagination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:36]** So the first thing you notice, Zoa, after seeing the riverbank is that this is not the river that you're used to seeing.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** It is the same body of water, but it is roiling.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** It is tumultuous.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:47]** I mean, it's almost angry that you collective of people are approaching the river.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:54]** So your possum crew are having a really hard time getting the boat ready to launch.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** They can do it.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** They can do it.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** They always do.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:01]** And you would know that this is a pretty dangerous path to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:07]** He puts his hands on his hips and looks out at the rough waters and then turns to Cletus to consult him.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** He's like, what do you think?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:14]** Cletus just kind of looks up at... I agree.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** But I think we'll make it.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** I think we'll make it yet.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** All right.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** All right.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Everyone get on the Possum Palace.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Stations are banned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** I just love that you canonically speak Possum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:34]** So we might not just be tussling with the Langleys, but with this boat too, Zoa.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** That's what I'm worried about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** No, no, no.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Cletus and the crew, they're professionals.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** They'll get us there all right.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Don't you worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:49]** Can I roll intellect to see if this can really navigate these waters?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Yes, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** I'm about to throw a wrench in zone.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** How many wrenches do you have?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** I rolled a 10.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** Look, I'm a master of sleight of hand.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** I can pull wrenches out of anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** I was just going to hand wave the existence of a wrench in Ira's pocket.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** I mean, I do have hedge magic.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:16]** Like, I can...

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** I can do little small tricks.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:24]** I can make stuff float in the air or make little things appear or change the color of things.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** I've got all kinds of little hedge magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:30]** You can't use hedge magic to harm another creature or object.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:37]** No, but I can use it to create or pull a wrench out of nowhere and then use the wrench to harm somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** That's how I'm interpreting it.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:43]** I actually have on me a bag of heavy tools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** I keep stealing Cole's tools.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Yes.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** I like that so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Throwing my tools.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:51 - 00:47:18]** wow that's perfect because i'm also trained in sleight of hand yep you know like yeah it's so good he's just throwing 10 millimeter wrenches everywhere that's where right yeah that's my best snap on yep okay ira you wanted to to judge how crazy sorry cole you wanted to judge how crazy you think this trek is yeah um i rolled a 10 you can fair to middling

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** You think this is a bad idea.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:23]** Like, it's possible, but it's not advisable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:36]** I sense your lack of faith and conviction in this venture, but I'm telling you, many, many years, the crew has done very well at navigating similar waters.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Just not with four other people before.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** But it will be fine.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** That will just make the boat more steady, I think.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** And Cletus is a professional.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** And we also have Bill the Navigator.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** He's really good, too.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** We'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Zoe, you have a gift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:50 - 00:48:14]** for inspiring mistrust yeah come on now guys i mean this is the fastest way to get there i'm going to intervene with a uh gm intrusion oh thank goodness kelly you take two xp and give give one of those two to somebody else as the possum palace starts to take on water oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** Just sitting there at the bank.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Can I give it to Cletus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:23]** It's rocking so hard on the bank that the water's starting to crest over the sides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:28]** Can Cletus be a backup character in case one of us dies so he can play as Cletus?

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Because he can play as XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** Wait.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Get off the palace now!

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Get off!

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** And he takes the two XP and he gives one to... Who the hell else needed one?

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:47]** Julius, your ghost-like form required some buffing, some patching up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:52]** I mean, I'm the one who called out this boat here is about to capsize, but that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** I don't mind.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** You insulted me.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** I didn't insult nobody.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** Yeah, all right.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** Who needs some healing?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** That's what I want to know.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** It's not healing.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** It's XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Oh, it's XP.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** God damn it.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** You can use it, though, later in game.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** All right, cool, cool.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I'm going to give it to Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Cool.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** I would like to steal it from Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Do I get it?

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Are you giving it to me, actually?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Yeah, I'm giving it to you.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** This is awesome.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** XP all the way.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Excelsior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** Wait, so, okay, the Possum Palace isn't happening?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Is that what's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** I'm saying the Possum Palace is taking on water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** What happens next is up to you guys.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:33]** Are we on the Possum Palace, or are we just still looking at it as, like, my possums drown to death slow?

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** What is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** I think the three of them are still on the dock.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** I think you boarded and were trying to get things ready.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** You probably have an opportunity to either...

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:48]** Do something about it taking on water or get off the f***ing boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** What do you do?

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:58]** No one's going to... Zilla might consume a lot of fruit of the forest, but he knows that no one's going to want to go on this regardless.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:01]** So he's going to try to get his crew off.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** Are you going to bail it out?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:04]** You won't go on it anyway.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** I know you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** We should save your boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** We can take care of it later.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** My boys know what they're doing.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** It's alright.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** They'll be good.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** They have scuba diving gear.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Alright, everybody.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Off to the palace.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Let's go.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Back to the shore.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:22]** The three of them go back to the shore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:44]** drenched zoa hops off drenched from like the thighs down um glaring at all of you and there's a there's a line of possums deep disembarking behind you but there's one that you would recognize as cletus standing behind the helm with its paw on its forehead as it slowly like drops down into the river

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** No.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Cletus.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Cletus going down with the boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** No.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** This was all a plot to kill Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** This whole time.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** He got so tired of hearing about him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Oh, my God.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** I'm sorry, Kelly, that you're possible.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Not him.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** We killed Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** He's like the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** I thought he was like the first mate.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:14]** I will help ferry Cletus's beautiful soul across the river.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:20]** Can you please make him a ghost so I can still hang out with Cletus?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Hopefully the waters ain't so turbulent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** They took my poor Cletus.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** Look what they did to my boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** Look at how they massacred my boy.
