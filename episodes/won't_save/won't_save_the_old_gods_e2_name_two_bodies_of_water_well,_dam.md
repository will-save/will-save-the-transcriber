**[00:00:00 - 00:00:08]** Won't Save is an actual play podcast of the horror RPG Old Guns of Appalachia and contains content that may be disturbing to some listeners.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:12]** The stories and events depicted are fictional and intended for mature audiences only.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:15]** Listener discretion is advised.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:18]** Hello, family.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:24]** Gather round and let me tell y'all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:31]** Deep in the heart of the Avalachian wilderness, among the hollers and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale is...

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:31]** yet to be told.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:36]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:47]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper on the wind.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:52]** Hanks and Boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the pickin'.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:57]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:58 - 00:01:06]** Welcome to Walt's safe, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Well, hello there, family.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:20]** This is your definitely not dead GM, Vinnie Rodriguez, joined by John Swan, William of Cairn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** I'm informally John Swan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Heath of the Parkers.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** Hey, girl.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** And Kelly, Lord Gilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Good motto, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Good motto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Are we doing another British intro?

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** Is that what we're doing right now?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** I was thinking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** We can't do a British accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** We did it once.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** Insult anyone when we did it, so let's do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:45]** And now the music has to be, you know, it's tied to the music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:50]** This is delightful tea music, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:58]** I believe our banter this morning is regarding afternoon teas, much like this one.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:05]** So, gentlemen, your favorite afternoon tea item, if you would go clockwise around the table.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** Lord Gilliam, I believe you are the first of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:15]** Are we speaking of items or particular sort of tea type?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** Because I'm particular to orange pecan.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Ooh.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** And Ceylon teas and things like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** I've not considered this angle.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** I would allow either or both if you'd like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** I'll start with that and then I'll go with the accoutrement.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:36]** I do like the East India Company has recently brought these moon, they're called mooncakes from the Orient.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:42]** And I, you know, my uncle, as you know, the count, he's invested in that.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** And so I managed to get a sneak peek, as it were, with one of those.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** And I brought some today for you all to try.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** It's made with red bean paste, you see.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** Oh, red bean paste.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** Likewise, from south of the Orient, I have some Ceylon tea for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Lovely.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Yes.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Yes, quite good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Yeah, quite good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** I have to say, delicious.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Yes.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** What about Marquis Garrett?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** Oh, I'm Australian.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** We don't drink tea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** You just drink kangaroo milk down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:25]** A nice cold Carlton beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:28]** I could have sworn they'd brought you to the prison colonies.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** I got no use for it.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:42]** It's good to see you out of prison, I have to say, even though you can only come back to the homeland once a year for a week or so, and then you have to go back to the hellscape that you live in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Oh, I love the Land of Ols.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Certainly transformed you rather quickly.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** Yes.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** The sort of regional accent that you adopted.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Rather quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** It sometimes slips into Scottish, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** What year is this, by the way?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** I'm guessing 1800s at the very latest.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yes.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Yeah.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** Well, I just hopped a boat from Tassie then.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** Come visit y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** No worries, pirates.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** I didn't bring any tea, though.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** That's fine.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** We've got plenty here from Lord Gilliam.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** I don't quite like the smell of it.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Just try it.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** The Baron de Parquer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** What is happening?

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:32]** Oh.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:38]** Look, the only f***ing tea I care about is sweet tea vodka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Yes!

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** He's one of those northerners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** All right, mate.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** I think I have some of that.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Far north.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Vodka tea.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Sounds delightful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** All right.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:58]** Our company has gotten rather less and less couth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** It's international here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** Quite a motley crew we've got here.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** And from the West Indies.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** The West Indies.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Chief Swann?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** What the f*** is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** What are you saying?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Where are you from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Oh, I'm sorry.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** Not quite that far west.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** The West Indies might be a bit further.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** From Northern Ireland, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** No, from Scotland.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:38]** The thing is, you have to take the stone and you just, you have to squeeze it with your bare hands and you pull the moisture out of it and you let it sit in that nice teacup and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** You have... Bare hands, yes.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** And then you drink it.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** It tastes a lot like water.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** But f***ing that's good.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:51]** It's good to know that tea, someone else enjoys it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** This is so pleasant.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** These tea rocks...

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** Do you then hit them?

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** Is that this new pastime I hear?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** You actually swallow them, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:11]** Yeah, so that's the thing, is when you're drinking the tea, the water just comes and passes your teeth all down your throat, right?

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** And then the rocks do as well.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** And then you pass the rocks.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** That's how you drink the tea.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:21]** That's heaps of effort just for a drink.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** Is that the Blarney story I've heard so much about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]** No, that's them Irish.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** It's the savages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** Not quite the same.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** What is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** No, not the Scots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** And scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** And cut.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** This happens sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Apparently so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** You know, we just roll with it.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** We planned some banter, but the British ones are never planned.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah, it's true.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** It certainly caught me off guard.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** I was like, I have no idea how to engage with this titanium mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** That's exactly what I was thinking.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:08]** And my SCF inner fanboy was like, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** He's here.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** In the building.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** In the flesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** He is in the flesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** You need to stop doing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:35]** yeah we do i think that might be a new record for like populations denigrated per minute australia oh yeah i guess they shouldn't be in something australians the orient i mean they did lose the emu war so there's nothing left for them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I feel like it's fun.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** Completely obliterated the entire society.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:48]** Yeah, Heath, we have some list somewhere of just states and countries and parts of the world that we may have offended the listeners by doing things like that.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Yeah, or just saying, you know.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Welcome to the party.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Right.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Thank you.

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:00]** The list we haven't defended is shorter than the list of places that we have possibly defended.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** It's a good start.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:06]** And yet I check our downloads and they still come from outside the U.S., so I think we're okay.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** And from states that we've thought that we were blacklisted from.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** But you know what?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** It's absolutely fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** I hate listening to things occasionally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Oh, New Hampshire still listens to us?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Yeah.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** That's good.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Thank God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** I was worried about that one time.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** Y'all ready to alienate Appalachia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:30]** The entire region of Appalachia.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Please, Wes.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Yeah, please, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** My goodness, let's get into it.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** Okay, last time on Won't Save the Old Gods.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:55]** 12-year-old Ira, Cole, Julius, and Zoa went to sleep, heard a bedtime story about a fictional character named Rabbit Rabbit, who turns out to be not so fictional, and a very large rabbit.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** Strange rabbit.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Steal off into their...

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:15]** Fort they've been playing in for the entire summer, unbeknownst to them, was erected by this rabbit rabbit, who is a remarkably powerful character in this universe with the power to bring back the dead.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:24]** But as with all things magic and all things Appalachia, everything comes at a price.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:29]** Well, I'm angry because we paid that price, whatever it is.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** And then Julius had to literally go and die like two seconds later.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:37]** And we haven't even seen him in between when we were 12 and now, right?

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** So we're just like going to go back and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:44]** So let me clarify, because I fear I may not have explained it well.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:53]** So you agreed to pay this debt to Rabbit Rabbit if he brought your friend back to life.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** He brings Julius back to life.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** He's breathing as if he's never died.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** But all of you remember that that happened.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:09]** And that causes a rift in your relationships so that you end up going your separate ways.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:14]** And like, even if you stay near each other, you might keep in contact, but you're not nearly as close as you were that summer.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** Here we are 20 years later and Julius has died for real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:28]** So we were so freaked out by what happened that we couldn't even bear to look at each other or something for the last 20 years is kind of what happened?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** Also, we just grew apart, you said.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Yeah.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** Life takes different paths for each of us.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** Right.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** We have different obligations, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:38 - 00:11:02]** yep but didn't it say we always kind of find our way back together inexplicably um you drift apart and you um only come together again truly until 20 years later after julius has died like so you end up how do you yeah sorry he's go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:15]** I was just like thinking back to the little Backstory Connections and stuff And it's like well when did Cole Prevent me from being Convicted of a crime


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:23]** And I say that to say, like, the four of you all together have not, like, joined forces.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Okay, just not the whole squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** So, Ira and Cole are hanging out.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Do I get to hang out?

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** Or am I just chilled by myself with animals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:39]** Maybe even the memory, though, of Julius' death caused me in that moment to look the other way, kind of, with Ira.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:48]** Because I know that we have a secret together, kind of, that's like this death and...

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:58]** That that kinship was, you know, ignited in that moment over this sort of really awkward and horrible circumstance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:03]** Yeah, I feel like it's not so much that Ira and Cole are like just hanging out all the time.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** They run in the same circles of Appalachia.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:15]** And just every now and then it's almost like there's this weird eldritch magnetism where it's like we keep ending up kind of crossing paths.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** But they're not necessarily friends.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:27]** They would have a weird awkwardness around each other about the shared secret of the, you know, Julius's initial death and then not death.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Right.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** But I feel like they don't talk about it.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:36]** And they like when they do run into each other, it's there's some kind of like minor crisis every time.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:43]** Or if they do just hang out and drink, it's like they drink and avoid talking about the Julius thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Yeah.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** That's amazing.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:53]** I think it would make sense for Julius that, like, in the interim, you would see him, but maybe it's, like, it's still awkward.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Like, you still know, like, you saw him there dead.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** And that is... That might be painful.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:04]** But also, you might grow apart because, like, as you grow older...

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:33]** people that you know in your circles will die so when you're seeing Julius you're seeing him at like your most vulnerable moments when you're there to you know like memorialize and work through the passing of somebody that's in your family and like that's the only time that you see him that's not really a time that you're gonna like try and catch up you know so it would make sense that he just naturally kind of moves like changes orbit from y'all and doesn't see you as much you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** Yeah.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** So it was just off in the woods.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** So just left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** Oh yeah.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Yeah.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** So, so it didn't want to deal with any of that.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** So he's just off in the woods still looking for a pot belly pig.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:49]** Uh, he's not convinced for sure that they're really at, he just, just went off grid.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:50 - 00:14:06]** yeah everything and like one i i didn't really get to develop a uh arc or whatever but and i think it's something completely self-created or it can be so that's something he wants to do he wants to get like closer to nature and find the pot-bellied pig thanks heath for throwing that out there i'm just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** I think that's his true main quest is find a pot belly pig.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** Every day he like grips his little like necklace thing.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:21]** And then sometimes we'll just see Julius, like, like creepily looking out from like the town as he like goes in to get supplies.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** And he'll be like, nod.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Good to see you still.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Oh my God.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Got it.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** You got it.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** What was that voice?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** I don't know.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** I can't commit to what I'm still trying to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** Good to see you're still living there, Julius.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Good to see you're still alive.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Goodbye, Julius.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** He just literally backs away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:50]** Staring at you the whole time just creepily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Goodbye, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:58]** Is this like a deliverance thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** Sorry, Julius.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** You creep me out too much.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** I can't stick around.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** Bye-bye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:27]** i love the mental picture of like you're in you're a ranger in appalachia and like people come up there to find bigfoot you're like no no no the potbelly pigs though yeah legend has it about the potbelly pig i'd love to it's also the the creature that you find it said it can be your size or smaller and it's like okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:35]** An equivalent weight pig to regular sized human is like, okay, a fairly large pig, not even like an abnormally large pig.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** How much do pigs weigh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** It's true.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** I mean, like, it's doable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:51]** I imagine Cole occasionally comes across Zoa's trail as he's out in the forest and woods, you know.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** Making shine, because Prohibition, obviously.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** It's a lucrative trade.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** I won't tell anyone, Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** You know me.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** You looking for some... Even though I am some kind of law around here.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** What's up?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Looking for some Mountain Dew there.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Always, Cole.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Do you have the diet sort this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:15]** Well... I got some Honeydew over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Okay, okay.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** Is he slinging moonshine or vape pens?

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** What are we doing?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Yeah, right?

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** This one's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** Moonshine.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** Got the cherry sort.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** Some smooth taste of moonshine.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** I'm done with sorts.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I had enough.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:40]** I like this idea, Zoa, that you're this explorer, too, and you see these things occurring.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** You see our lives developing, and we don't always necessarily see yours.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:58]** I think in the same way that you run across Kohl's still, I think at some point you run across the mortuary, Whispering Pines, and it's not a graveyard anymore.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:04]** It's a grotto that you have to be lowered into with a wench.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:12]** And so I imagine at some point you've seen our family bringing bodies to the grotto.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** And it's meant to be a secret place, but you've seen that.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** So you've seen all of us in our rituals.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** Maybe you've seen Ira, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** I don't know.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** It's cool.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:25]** Is there something particularly creepy or weird about your rituals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** I think, yeah.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:51]** there's a level of orthodox perhaps yeah i mean it's it's unorthodox because i think there are times where you walk over and maybe you you're you're walking to that grotto and as you do you you feel this sense of uncertainty and transience like you're maybe entering into a space that is a veil between worlds and so when you look over

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:05]** I think when you look and try and see in the grotto, it's, it's a little misty and a little dark, but you think that you just see that these bodies are, are laid out in like this nice ordered row, but they're just open.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** They're just decomposing in their own way.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:14]** It kind of reminds me a little bit of like, you know, like the tomb of the sky kind of thing.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Right.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** And so, and that's definitely like picket corpses or something.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** Yeah, and it's not quite like that, because there's this element of the green, right?

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:30]** But I think that that is definitely a closely guarded secret.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** Like, when people, you know, come to give the bodies to the family, then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:36 - 00:19:06]** they don't quite know what's going to happen to the body wants to avoid like no offense but like he wants to like as I said he kind of doesn't want to interact too much with a lot of people but particularly you even though you're a good friend and so he like tries to avoid that area but being a being a ranger as he is he sometimes does get called into work around those parts and so as you say I never like I never like being here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Shall we get into it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Reckon so.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Let's do it.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Let's play.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Let's play.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:22]** The funeral for your friend Julius is finished, and it was mostly exactly as you thought it would be.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:30]** What you didn't expect was to hear their voice during the event recorded and played back, a voice lifted in song, accompanied by the haunting tunes of a fiddle.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:38]** Julius always did have music in their blood, even when they were little, and their voice had grown beautifully over the years.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:43]** It was as if Julius was right there with you, singing songs like they used to in the clearing in the woods.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:51]** Each of you left the funeral moved by this music in your own way, drawn by something you could feel but couldn't name.

**[00:19:52 - 00:20:02]** It was both surprising and inevitable that you ended up right here in this clearing, with these friends of your childhood who are no longer children, perhaps no longer even really friends.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** But you know why you're here.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** You remember the rabbit that wasn't a rabbit.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** You remember the promise you made.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** You remember your oath.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:15]** And of course, you remember Julius.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** Even more so because it feels like you can still hear their voice out here in the woods.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Not singing now, but saying something.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** Saying your names.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Saying hello.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** How could that possibly be?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:38]** And it's at that moment you see Julius again.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** start to approach from within the woods.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** What the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:45]** Howdy, boys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** What tarnation's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I knew it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** I knew it was just going to be like a ghost haunting us forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** This son of a b***h is dead, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** Is that who I think it is popping here out of there?

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Oh, no, not again.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Again?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** Well, I just keep seeing him here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** I know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** That can't be.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Yeah.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Go ahead, John.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:12]** Do I know how I died, and do I know that I'm dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** You know you're dead.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Okay.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** You died of natural causes.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** Like, it wasn't anything outrageous.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** It's just ridiculously low life expectancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:27]** Heart attack, average 32-year-old death in 1800s Appalachia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Runs in the family.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Liver failure, who knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Mercury poisoning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** Absolutely.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** I drink it every night as a tonic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** Some rock gut whiskey, not for me, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Howdy, boys.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** It's good to see you.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Good to see you.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** I see a ghost.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:51]** I think you see his, like, visage is... It's just paler.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:58]** It's almost as if you couldn't take his, like, already pale, deathly visage, you know, where he has, like, a three-piece suit.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** He's still wearing a suit, but somehow his body is, like, seemingly paler.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** He's not, like, translucent or anything, but he just...

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:30]** if like it's like an impressionist painting if you get in too close it looks like you can start to see how it's it's not all the detail isn't quite there but when you back up it's more coherent yeah so mechanically these three can see you you are a ghost okay you cannot be seen by like other people unless they have a reason to be able to see ghosts

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** Yo, Ira, you want to steal some more shit?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** And I'll tell you where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Yeah, brother.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Already scheming.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:41]** Come on, brother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Let's go.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Now you're speaking my language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** I ain't standing for this.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:54]** I think Julius came from probably the direction that you would just know is like towards the mortuary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Yeah.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** You all see what I've seen, right?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** I do not like what I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** It's me, boys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** That's you, Julia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** It's me.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Well, I'm definitely seeing him.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** And it's at that moment you notice that Rabbit Rabbit has joined the circle.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** One more time.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Rabbit Rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** You always sneak up on us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** Rabbit, did you do this to him?

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** We thought he died from natural causes, but I don't know.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** You had something to do with this, didn't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** I had absolutely nothing to do with him dying.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** I had something to do with him living.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Is that why he's a ghost, though?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Because you did that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** That is probably why we're here today.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** You murdered our friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Rabbit, are you murdering me?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** Rabbit, Rabbit, I don't kill animals usually, but I'm going to make an exception for you.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** I'm just saying.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** I don't want our boy.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** He could be up resting in heaven here.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** He's haunting us.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** You be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** I can't get in the teeth so hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:00]** You seem pretty confident about that one, so I'll take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** What a hard ass, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** I imagine y'all wonder why we're all here today.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** Well, now, reckon something got a bit tangled up, huh?

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** What's gone sideways here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:20]** Oh, this is about that O. Julius, I'm glad you could join us, even if, you know, temporarily, you are dead.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:28]** But, this O and this pact that you all made, you made together, must be satisfied together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** What do we owe you, Rabbit Rabbit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** One favor.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** And trust me, you're going to want to do this.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** There's a new corporation trying to move in.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Town called Langley, Pennsylvania.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** It's about 50 miles north of here.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:54]** Same town that moved in to Dismal 20 years ago and started pulling these mines out.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** They want to build a dam.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** This dam is going to reroute the river.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:09]** If they do that, one, that river will reroute through the town of Langley and sweep it away entirely.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:21]** Two, that river rerouting will open a door to evil so terrible, so destructive.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** And I no longer know the name.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** This door must remain sealed at all costs.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:43]** Now, I'm working with the river, and I'm working with the water, Amanda, to try to get this resolved, but she seems to have gone missing.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:48]** So, what I need you all to do, make sure this damn doesn't happen.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:54]** Convince the waterbender, convince the river, convince Langley, I don't really care.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** But this dam cannot go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** Well, I do have friends that could help with that.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** Do they have all the proper permitting for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** I'll tell you if we try to put bureaucracy in.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** The river itself to reject this dam.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** Well... The only person that speaks for the river is that water man.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** That old witch just north of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:29]** And you would know, like, there's been stories of a witch that lives in the woods.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:33]** Not anything nefarious, but, like, weird things that have happened.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** And so there's very likely, like, cause.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:42]** And also Rabbit Rabbit is, like, a sort of entity of the green.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** And so he would also have insider knowledge.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** I have seen weird things happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** So in the woods there...

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:58]** And seeing you right here in the flesh and a ghost next to me of my old friend.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** I guess I might have to believe you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Listen here, Rabbit Rabbit.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:05]** How y'all reckon we gonna sweet talk this watermanda?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Good that I knew how.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Oh, I'll handle that.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:18]** I went to see her myself, but she hadn't been there for four or five days now.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:25]** She's been a homebody as long as I've known her, so this is certainly out of the ordinary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** Do you... Where do you figure we can track her down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** Your guess is as good as mine.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:34]** I'd say wherever that trail ends, it definitely starts at her place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** All right.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** And so now, you're... Are you for this, Ira?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:48]** If anybody is going to be able to sweet talk an old wizened watermander cone, it's Ira Murphy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Ghost of Julius.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** You can just call me Julius.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** It's all right.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Ghost of Julius.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** I'm just the same as I was before.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** I'm in.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** I reckon you don't have much of a choice.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** None of us have much of a choice in this matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** He can travel with us freely, Julius can, correct?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Yes.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** He won't dissipate?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** I mean, he might, but yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:23]** And I feel like when I walk, you know, like Lee's crunch, you know, it's like I'm there as physically as I can be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:31]** I reckon, though, that it's feeling a bit airish, you around Julius, but I'm happy to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** Okay, if all else fails, we could use Julius to scare the shit out of people because he is a ghost and they can't see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** I'm absolutely going to be scaring the shit.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** You know, it's one thing seeing it from y'all's side.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** It's another seeing it from this side.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** I tell you, it's going to be a lot of fun.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** It's going to be a lot of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Fix it, tricks it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** Rabbit, Rabbit, were you the one who bought me here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Some part of that was me.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** Some part of that was to take you home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** Yeah, I figured as much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** Once we get all this sorted out, we'll figure out what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:09]** Well, that sounds a tad bit foreboding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Let's just hope luck is in your favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** So when we achieve this monumental task...

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:22]** Is our good friend, the ghost of Julius, then going to disappear to rest forevermore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** I can't tell if that's Heath or if that's Ira asking.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** That's Ira.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:33]** You've never heard Heath's accent nearly that pronounced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** Who's Heath?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** He's not that bad.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** That depends on what happens next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:46 - 00:30:07]** So you're saying that if we stop this day from going up, I may be able to come back?

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** In a manner of speaking, yeah.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** What else could he be?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** He's going to make you a zombie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** I'm absolutely going to be a zombie if that's the case.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Absolutely.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** I don't like Rabbit Rabbit right now.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** All right.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** I think... No, I'm ready.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I'll do what I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:38]** I suppose the path to stopping the dam will show itself to us as we take the next step of talking to this waterman.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Yeah, that would...

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** Lead the way, Rabbi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Rabbi, are you coming with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:57]** You would know that he doesn't give you a map, but you've heard enough stories to know that she's about 35 miles north of where you are.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** You could figure out a way.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:05]** I have a car, so let's not walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:18]** I'm all for the woods, but 35 miles is kind of far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:25]** Did you modify that five-horse Model T that you had?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:50]** okay this is not a car this is just a cannon i have i have a state-provided vehicle this is literally five horses tied to a carriage five whole horsepower five whole horses i have a baguette on we'll be there in three days three days riding hard yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** I didn't reckon you could steer a Model T through these woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** I think in those woods, a Model T steers you.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:04]** We're about to leave on this great adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** Are we getting horses or something, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:31]** a couple of things yeah i have horses i work for the state i can put a county state whatever i can provide you whatever you we need so we're not we're not like leaving the woods just yet we can we have the opportunity now to buy any supplies you might want to try to purchase i don't know how much money your characters have uh if you want to have zero dollars it explicitly states i have two dollars

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** If you want to find somebody in town.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** But that's a lot of money in 1920.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:39]** Yeah, zero dollars is still zero, unfortunately.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** You could buy a house for like 600 bucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** I have one dollar scripts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Okay.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** So what is a script?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:51]** A script is basically like... It's owed, right?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** Yeah, kind of.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:57]** So it's money given... It's basically an advance on a paycheck from the mining company.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:02]** But it spends just like money because this is a mining town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:02]** Okay.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:12]** I didn't know if it was like specifically like you've got to get just like stuff related to the mining company or is there a limitation there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** No, it's an advance on your on your doodads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:19]** I mean, I have no idea what to buy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:47]** healing potions are those a thing in this game um they are not they would be considered ciphers and i think you guys are still fully stocked up on ciphers so you may not want to buy anything i don't i don't know if you wanted to ask any npcs anything more about the watermander or you know how to get there what is the watermander like yeah oh who are you asking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** Well, I mean, I don't know who I'm asking.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Are you talking to Rabbit Rabbit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** I would, yeah.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Rabbit Rabbit has hopped off.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** So we could go around town and ask.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Do we need food to survive?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:04]** Let's make this our first roll of the game.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Oh, cool.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** We'll make this a difficulty four intellect roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Everybody rolling it?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:21]** For skills, if you have anything... It's a difficulty 4.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** 4 times 3 is 12.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Yes.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:29]** If you have any training in lore, knowledge, or understanding, I would give you...

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:35]** I would make that eased for you, Zoa, because you are in able.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** You have an inability in lore, knowledge, and understanding.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:40]** It would be effectively a level five for you.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** So you'd have to roll at or above 15.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** Like the skill is called lore colon.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Lore, knowledge, understanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** Okay, because I have understanding magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Same.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I would give that to you.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You have an inability or you have training?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** The X is in the T box, so trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** Yep, so it would be eased by one level for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Oh, so it's nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Yeah.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Right?

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:24]** coal fails miserably and sorry and then i have an edge in intellect okay so i do too so then it would be one low no if you wanted to apply effort you could spend one fewer point on that effort in the pool from the pool got it wait i have an okay cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:28]** I have the foggiest idea what this waterman is after.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** How to get to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Who they are.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** What'd you two roll?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** I rolled a six.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:38]** I have an edge in intellect, but you're saying I have to spend something in order to use that, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** I'm probably not going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** So if you have a six, you definitely failed.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** You know nothing about the watermander.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** Julius rolled a 10, which I think you said it was ease one level.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** So it's at a nine.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I rolled an 11.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Okay.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Nailed it.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:03]** So then Ira and Julius would know the watermander actually comes into town fairly often.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:14]** Um, and so I actually, I would expect Julius would know her as a, like, because he is also a speaker and is mystical.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** Like they would have collaborated on, you know, magical efforts.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** you might've consulted her on magical efforts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:29]** You might've consulted her, uh, on, you know, tactics to protect the grotto from whatever.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:38]** Um, yeah, Ira, I imagine you tried to like hustle her out of something and she just like saw right through you, but,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:43]** Or, well, maybe, because that's been the prevailing sentiment about Ira.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:48]** But also, Ira is secretly obsessed with learning more magic.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** So maybe he tried to convince her to show him some tricks.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:59]** And then when people asked why she slapped him or whatever, it's like, oh, I tried to pickpocket her.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:05]** He tries to keep his roguish reputation up and not the magical reputation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:12]** So the watermander is not a magical creature at all.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:16]** I mean, she has magic, but she's a woman, just like any other.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:30]** She's an older, cronish lady, spends a lot of time by herself at home, but will come into town fairly often to buy supplies and is kind to the people that she interacts with.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:36]** She's polite, but she's also borderline standoffish.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** Like, she'll hear you out in your request, but she's going to tell you no.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Okay.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** So.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** Yeah, that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:49]** I mean, because I'm just a little rapscallion running around.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Right.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Because I was going to ask this earlier.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:59]** So the premise is we get our first scene at 12, and then the adventure starts 22 years later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:19]** 20 ish so like we're all are 20 years later so we're all 32 exactly 32 ish yeah okay and to be clear the like so langley is this town or is langley the company langley is it langley pennsylvania is the town that will get wiped out if the river gets rerouted

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Because this company is trying to build the dam.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:31]** We know this company has previously extorted and, you know, like, just pretty much bled dry a whole other town before.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Right.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:36]** On top of that, moving the dam would unleash or open the gates to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** It's literally going to flood a town, is what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Yeah.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:46]** It will literally flood a town and also unleash some sort of eldritch horror.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Basically.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** Okay.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Okay.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** We kind of got our backs up against the wall.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** Well, we got a dam, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Unqualified for this.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Can't let this company put up the dam.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Do I know anything about this company?

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Do any of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** I don't like companies in general.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Not one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** You don't know much?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** The only company I keep is my pot still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** That's too funny.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** I keep that company, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** Well, and all the town folk, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:40]** i get around companies all these ghosts here and there yeah it's wait till we do we don't i'm just jumping through my notes because it is like it's the langley coal and mining company and the town is langley pennsylvania okay so yeah so the company's just named after right um okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:46]** It's so interesting that Rabbit Rabbit is kind of foretelling what will happen.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:51]** So the people building the dam, they wouldn't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** They ain't no mind to do an environmental study.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** I mean, we don't quite know their motivations.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:04]** They might know and not care because it's going to profit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Step three, profit.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** Essentially.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:19]** No, you don't know anything about Langley Coal and Mining Company, but you might find stuff out from NPCs along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** All right.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** Well, let's find out from some NPCs along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:27]** I reckon we head to town first.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** So you head to town.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** There is your standard accoutrement.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** There's a train station.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** There's a general store.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:42]** There's a funeral parlor, which you have presumably just left, although you don't remember really leaving the funeral parlor to get to the fort.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** You just kind of like happened there.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Where do you want to go?

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** What's in this town?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Never mind.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** You just answered that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:55]** Is there a house of ill repute?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** A gambling den?

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:00]** Something like that would be very much my speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** I agree.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** A good place to pick up rumors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** I need to do... Have a drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** That as well.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Let's see.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:14]** Well, nowhere publicly, because this is during the Prohibition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Speak easier, Daddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Right.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:30]** However, you would know that there is a particular coat rack in the general store that if tapped on the ground three times, a certain door opens up and you might be able to make your way to somewhere that sounds like where you're going.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Yes.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Yeah.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** I feel Ira would already know about that place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Right.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** Ira has his name carved into a chair there, I think.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** I suppose Cole is one of the providers.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yeah.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** He's a supplier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** So Cole knows exactly where it is.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Do you go there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Yes.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** All right.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Cool.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** That sounds amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:54]** So the four of you step into a speakeasy.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Jesus Christ.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** This is the beginning of every adventure starting in a tavern.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Yep.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:06]** You all walk into the speakeasy and they're playing records of like old school bluegrass.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:12]** And I don't have a scounscape for this because I wasn't prepared for you guys to go to a speakeasy.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:30]** um and you belly up to the bar the four of you and uh ira and cole immediately recognized the bartender duke davis um as he's polishing polishing mugs and and you know low balls and keeping his bar

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Well, after doing there, gentlemen, what can I do you for?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Howdy, Duke.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Hey there, Cole.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** You got that latest about ready for us?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** We're going to be out of that good shine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** I got some stuff mashing right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Oh, I love that.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** You're such a good dude, even if you are a moonshiner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** What you doing there, Duke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** I just pour.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Give people what they want.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:59]** Well, you ain't pouring no rock gut, are you?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Not unless you're bringing it to me.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Heck no.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** Rock gut and your special moonshine and beer is about all we got.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Can I give you guys something to drink?

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** I'll have some of Cole's.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** All right.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** You want a single or double?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Double please.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Double up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Fix me up a single.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** A single.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** You like yours neat.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Zoa, you neater on the rocks.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Zoa, neat or on the rocks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Oh, is that me?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Neat, neat.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Thank you.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** You gotta wake up, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** My goodness.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** It's like y'all have seen a ghost or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Come on now, wake up.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** You got some coffee as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Just slosh it all together.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** It's odd you use that specific turn of phrase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:41]** Yeah.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:47]** I mean, three folks walk into my bar and looking the way y'all do, I gotta wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Well, there's three folks that walked in.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Give me three fingers of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:16]** three fingers of hooch coming right up and he he grabs his glasses and he pours it meticulously and hands them to you um all right sean is it is there anything else i can do for you well we were hoping i'm sorry i i gotta pause what what am i trying to find out from this dude i already lost the plot of this whole thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:20]** Just find out about the wizard lady?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:24]** Dude, can you have a heard tale of this watermander lady?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Yeah, so like elbows.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** Ira's like, dude, work your magic now about the watermander.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** She ever come in down here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** You got your connects here.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:42]** Roll, make an intellect roll difficulty.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** I'll say difficulty two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** Who's this?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:56]** Okay, so when speaking to others in a community you have a strong connection to, you are trained in persuasion and intimidation tasks about topics that directly relate to the community.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** Okay, so that would be a difficulty one.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** You need a three or better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** 14.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Nice.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Am I rolling a 20, right?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** D20?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Yeah.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Yeah, I've heard about her.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** I mean, she's never day into dark in this store, but I would expect her to.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** She mostly keeps to herself.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Spends a lot of time in that river.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** Her rumor that she could talk to it.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:25]** I don't know if I believe such malarkey, but that's what people say.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:34]** Matter of fact, I actually haven't seen her at the town shops or roaming around anywhere recently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** You know what she normally gets up to in town?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Keeps to herself.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:47]** She goes, she gets her supplies and her groceries and goes right on back to her shack in the woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** Seeing as how you don't know much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:59]** Well, this shack, you know where it is because then we could head over there, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** I say we hit the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** Yeah, there's a few ways to get up to that shack.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:08]** I don't have a map, but you could go through the woods, follow the river.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** You're bound to get it eventually.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Oh, it's right on the river.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** All right.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:20]** Also, I think, Cole, you might know this better than I do, whatever you're running around those parts.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** I don't know what you're talking about now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Don't speak out of school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** Sorry.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** I don't want to air your dirty laundry in front of everybody.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** I'd hate for my next order to be all whopper jawed.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:38]** This is Vinny's best NPC, by the way.

**[00:46:39 - 00:47:04]** yeah you could there's a road that'll take you almost all the way there there's a little traipse through the woods once you get off the road and uh you know i i hear that they just opened up that new railroad and you know they're not taking passengers yet but i bet if you you know make make a little hop you can get right on that cargo train and get you there in the jiffy well that does sound fun so you all know i do have a boat that we could take straight up as well it's up to you i mean if it's like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** I don't know how feasible a boat is.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:11]** I don't know if it's a river or a creek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Well, it says I have a boat.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** It is a river, is it not?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Oh, it's definitely a river.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:19]** I would know what it is.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** At some point, it probably turns into a creek, right?

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** As you're kind of crossing over.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** I think it's a large enough.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Yes, I'm sorry.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** Right.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** It's large enough out of water to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:36]** You've been living in Appalachia your whole life and don't know the difference in a creek and a river?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** It's a river, I tell you.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** It is.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** He's probably seen all those parts.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** A bright river and we can take a boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:47]** I mean, would we know this is, is it a navigable river for a boat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:52]** Duke, Duke casually grabs Lois, Zoe's glass and like puts it behind the bar.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Like he's done.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Oh my God.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** I have been all up and down that river all my life.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** I know that it's traversable, right?

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** Yes.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** I can do it.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** If no one else.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Yes, it is.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** Duke, pull me another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** That's right.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Now give me back my drink.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:08]** All right.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Yeah, it's plenty big for a boat.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** I mean, I don't know how big your boat is, but it should be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** Duke is giving me Jackie Daytona vibes from what we do in the shadows.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** If y'all watch that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** I've never heard of Jackie Daytona, but if he wants a drink, send him my way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:29]** Can you see me, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** I don't know where that voice came from.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:38]** This disembodied reference to someone I've never heard of, but I'm always down to serve a customer.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** I actually think he heard the voice and thought Ira said it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Cool.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** We can take this riverboat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** I have it right next to my cabin.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Is it, like, steam-powered?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:52]** No, it's not.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** I don't think so.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** It's a flat-bottomed boat.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** It's not a steam-bottomed boat?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** It's a f***ing canoe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:58]** It's not.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** I got a rope.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Well, it's powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:07]** I have a fleet of opossums that power it.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** They wind it, and they direct.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** It's possum-powered.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** That's all you need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Make this possum-powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Make it intellectual.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:21]** You're 100% full of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:30]** I am very mad that the term, it's possum power, powered, like a rose on a wheel save show, not an STL network show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:56]** it's powered by you all you did that yeah um all right so an intellect roll that's a d20 great to try to try to convince these people that you have a possum power so waiting on them it's a natural 20 and also if you need i can lean into it with my intellect as well for a natural 20 i will actually give you a possum powered boat

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:19]** amazing thank you i all right good i already had a possum that would exist already it's right here in my equipment spectacular do you recall that i i'm very close with animals and i have 12 that i trained a neat dozen possible i've seen so they are very capable in that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:40]** the river when i was alive i saw them training possums from from the shadows of the fire when they're not hunting pot-bellied pigs they're powering your boat yeah that's it now don't don't you talk about that legend of the potbelly if you have 12 possums powering your boat like that's not much


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:40 - 00:51:02]** like that's gonna be a slow that's a 12 possum like the conversion rate from possum to horsepower is like not good i'm downright flabbergasted at the mere thought of a possum powered these are large possums there's barely room enough for all of us they're so large


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:11]** We have suspended our disbelief for the fact that I'm a ghost talking to you in a bar on this watermander.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** But we can't get over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** But 12, not 40 possums.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** Just 12 possums power in a four-person boat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** It's possum possum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** These are dire possums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** Your lack of faith in possums disturbs me.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** I need you to have more faith in me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:35]** I have a realistic view of the strength of a possum.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** I've arm wrestled a possum before.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** You know how many possums I've arm wrestled?

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:45]** I live in Mississippi.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:48]** Anyway, sorry to ruin your show with my possum antics.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** This is the show, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** I ain't never laid eyes on a possum like that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:04]** I say we take my possum express up right to that watermander location.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** And I won't do you wrong.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** They've done me just right.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:09]** And I've taken groups larger than we all.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** We'll be all right.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** And plus, Julius doesn't weigh nothing now.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** He's a ghost.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** So we're all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Duke's like, he is very efficient in that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** Yeah, I am sorry to hear about you, friend.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** That was terrible.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** I mean, taken so young.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** I guess he doesn't weigh anything now.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Lord rest his soul.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Well, I do.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** The weight of my actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** He can't hear you, Julius.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:41]** He said that the weight of his actions will... He's always sort of philosophical like that.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:46]** Does the barkeeper think that Julius, our dead friend, he's right here with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** He's starting to think we're f***ing crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** And he takes your clothes back again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:52 - 00:53:01]** No, I love this because you made mention earlier that he thought it was Ira that was actually the ghost speaking.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:06]** I think now Julius is just making it a problem because he keeps commenting.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:13]** So Ira has to keep trying to match what he's saying and mumble over it.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:19]** He's trying to keep up the ruse that it's him, not an incorporeal ghost friend.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** This is spectacular.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** We best get a move on.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:29]** I reckon we ought to swing by the general store before we head out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** I'd also like to add a stop.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:38]** I think it would be good for me, but also for us, if we stop by Whispering Pines.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** I want to see my family, even though they can't see me.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** But, you know, we've done some work with the water, man.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** So it may be...

**[00:53:46 - 00:54:03]** a case that there might be something there some sort of order or you know something that my my pa and ma have have done with her that they have that we can find i don't mean to be rude julius but uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:10]** If we're going to go to your folks' establishment, maybe don't just be popping off with your ghost voice all over the place.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** These people have been traumatized enough by your death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** Are you guys still having this conversation in front of Duke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** We're all just so drunk now we don't care.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:24]** We're all just like looking at an empty seat and just like, yeah, talking to this.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Here, do leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** You're right.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You're right.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** I won't.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** I won't.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** I'll stay quiet.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:51]** check please all right he sends he gives you the check and it's like you know 75 cents and he writes back i owe you on it you know i'll take it off your next order he he he takes it and he sticks it on a very like he's got tabs for everyone on like metal spikes decorated iron board yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Comically large, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Alright, good luck, y'all.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** The empty seat pushes itself in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:04]** Ira turns quickly to make it look like he pushed it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** Which is funny because you can explicitly interact with objects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** That's great, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:14]** I'm basically like a second-hand puppet to Julius now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** I'm not trying to do that.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** I'll watch where I step.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** And you walk out.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Where are you going next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** I reckon we go to the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Well, you're already in the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:33]** You had to go through the store to get to the speakeasy, so you exit the speakeasy into the general store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Oh, we just go back into the store and party.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:41]** Go upstairs and talk to the man behind the counter, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** To your surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** I suppose I know him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** The person behind the counter is not a man.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** It's a woman.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** It's Miss Wilma Baker.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Well, hi there, darling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Howdy, Wilma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Hi, darling.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** How you doing?

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** How you doing tonight?

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** You know, if I was any better, I'd pop.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** What can I do for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** Say, you ever interact with that...

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** What, Amanda character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Yeah.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** She's in here like clockwork every third day.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:18]** Buys her eggs and her rations and, you know, gets a couple of vegetables, tends to her garden, might get some fertilizer every now and then.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:22]** Come to think of it, I haven't seen her when I should have.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** What else could I tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** You ever spend much time talking to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** Oh, she's not one for many words.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Mostly keeps to herself.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Keeps her head down.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Keeps her nose clean.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** My favorite kind of customer, if you ask me.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** When's the last time you saw her?

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** Must have been about a week ago now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** So that's suspicious to you then, right?

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** She's only in here every third day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Like clockwork, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** That is suspicious.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Did she indicate?

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** I'll see.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** Did she indicate that something was wrong?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** She seemed fine when I saw her.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Anything was troubling her?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** She didn't talk about traveling or nothing.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** All right.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:22]** got any idea how she pays for her groceries money usually i don't know i never really questioned how does anybody pay for the groceries get a job we all got jobs you know yeah so some of us you know sell wares and some of us make make goods that other people like and she winks at cole i guess she must have some something to do up there in that shack reckon that's fair enough


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** Say, I'm looking for some supplies.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** I might go out for a trek, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** All right.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** The supplies are over yonder.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:40]** Back there, you see some jerky and trail ration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:43]** I'll get a compass if they got one.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** Yeah.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Maybe a lantern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Some chaw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:53 - 00:58:11]** are you gonna try to barter or are you gonna pay rack rate I'll barter alright give me an intellect roll I mean do I I'm still a community activist skill okay and I rolled a 16 awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:35]** colt you know for for most normal folk that come out to about 70 cents but you know seeing as you fixed our roof that one time and you're so helpful in this community i think i could probably make it work for about 40 cents for you how's that sounds modifying oh you're just the best cole murphy well thank you wilma she hands you your stuff and and it's wilma right yep wilma baker


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:41]** Ira comes in like a little too hard, nudges Cole in the side.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:44]** It's like, she's into you.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Talk to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** Nah, Ira.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** I wouldn't be doing such a...

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** I mean, is she married?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** What's her situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** She's married to Cal Baker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:02]** Regardless of if she's married, Ira is like, she's into you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** I'm going to introduce my first complication of the game.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** Oh, nice.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:14]** It's at that moment that Cal steps in and sees this exchange and draws the same conclusion that Ira does.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Oh, no.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Wilma.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** See, I said she was into you.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** Wilma, are you sweet on that Cole Murphy thing?

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** Cole, you know what you're doing.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** What are you doing giving all these discounts?

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** You can't do that.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** We're going to go under just like everybody else in this town has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** Now, listen here, Cal.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** You know me.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** I don't go messing with a woman that's spoken for.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Cole is a good man like that.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:43]** And we struck up a deal since I did that roof job.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:48]** And I did the same favor for Wilma here at this store.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** She's doing the same favor for me.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** It's no thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** And that's not a euphemism there, Cal.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:00]** It's just literally the goods that we're buying, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** Now, you talk plain with me, Cole Murphy.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:07]** You and Wilma doing something on the side, or is this on the up and up?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** I'm speaking plain.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:17]** And you see the fire in his eyes start to die down, and his million-dollar smile comes back.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:24]** Him and Wilma co-own the general store, and so he puts his customer service smile back on.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** You, Cole Murphy, you jokester.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** I get it.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** I appreciate your business and you helping us out.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Ain't no thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Go ahead.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:43]** So Ira trying to fully sell Cole's honor here is like, yeah, like I told Cole she was into him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** He should go, you know, head towards that.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** And he wouldn't.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** He's too honorable.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:53]** He wouldn't pursue your wife even a little bit, even when I tried to convince him to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:58]** Ira Murphy, you better make sure your pockets are as empty as they were when you walked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** I got nothing.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** And he pulls out a deck of cards and just starts shuffling them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:06]** And you get the hell out of my general store, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]** Well, can I get $1 script worth of jerky?

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** That's about eight pounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Let me tell you what you can get.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** You can get the hell out of my general store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** All right, that'll work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:24]** Will you get two XP, one to keep, one to give to another player?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:28]** I'm going to give my point to Ira.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:29]** Thank you.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:36]** For his attempt, his noble attempt, though pilfering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** He was genuinely trying to help you.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** He just has very poor judgment.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Well, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** It's so good.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:48]** Yeah, keep track of your XP because you can use it throughout the game.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** Awesome.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** What do we do next?

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** Are we going to Whispering Pines?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** Are you all ready for Possum Palace to take us up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Possum Palace?

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:00]** Well, I was thinking... Do you have other things you want to do in town first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:12]** Well, I was just thinking that we could maybe see any reason why the Waterman... Well, that, but also any insight into why the Waterman hasn't been around for a while.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** Maybe there's been something that's been going on, something that we've helped with before.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** I thought that they might have that.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:18]** That's all.
