**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Won't Save is an actual play podcast of the horror RPG Old Guns of Appalachia and contains content that may be disturbing to some listeners.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:12]** The stories and events depicted are fictional and intended for mature audiences only.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:14]** Listener discretion is advised.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:18]** Hello, family.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:24]** Gather round and let me tell y'all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:31]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollers and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale is...

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:31]** yet to be told.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:36]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:46]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper on the wind.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:52]** Hanes and boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the picking.

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:57]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:06]** Welcome to Won't Save, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** And welcome back.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:24]** This is Vinnie Rodriguez, your terrified GM, joined by Will Garrett, John Swan, Kelly Gilliam, Heath Parker from the STF Network, and this is Won't Save.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:30]** Okay, first, what are we doing here?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Why am I the GM?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:39]** Well, funny enough, we were at this little thing in Indianapolis called Gen Con.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:45]** We were all hanging out in a house and playing games and seeing what was going on.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:50]** We were hooting, hollering, and rooting and tooting and having lots of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Being some buckaroos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Being some buckaroonies.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Yeah.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** And tested out a game called The Old Gods of Appalachia.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** The Old Gods.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** And I thought it was really cool.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:04]** So we had a bit of a lull in our schedule.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** We're all busy adults.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** And so sometimes we got to switch it up.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** Shout out our boy Kevin, who's currently piloting rockets or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:40]** So, this week, we're talking about Session Zero.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** But before we do that, we're going to do what we always do.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** We're going to have a little bit of banter.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:54]** So, in the theme of this week, tell me about your scariest horror movie experience.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:59]** I'm going to let this percolate for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** I just saw it percolate so hard with Heath.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** He just leaned back in the chair, just like, eyes up.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:09]** You would think that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** I'm actually a big old baby, and I don't do scary movies.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** I don't dig them.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** It's like, why am I here?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:33]** I would rather do a horror TTRPG than... I feel like the horror movie industry, while it has had a bit of a renaissance in the last few years, for so long relied so heavily on jump scares and stuff, and I hate that s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:33 - 00:04:03]** so much that it like scarred me for years and i just it's got to be a like transcending the genre getting that kind of review from other people for me to want to watch a horror movie i think like it has to i agree with that i also avoid them it has to have that kind of maybe suspense the wrong is the wrong word but if it's like smartly written and intriguing and whatever that's cool but it is really just full of jump scares like suspense and terror yeah yeah

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:29]** the thing is yeah oh no i was gonna say there was a girl that i was seeing for a while and she showed me that there's a movie about the book of the dead or something like that and i think it's called hellraiser she showed that to me and that was the first sign of many signs that it wasn't a good fit uh but like uh yeah it got way darker and weirder after that she wanted the movie or the relationship she really liked blood like it was weird and uh yeah okay i i

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** I don't like horror movies either.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Her blood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Or, like, just blood in her possession?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Like, what are we... Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** We're talking some, like... It's not fit for a podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Who's that actress that's into it with Machine Gun Kelly?

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** For... Oh, uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** You know how you talk about the things that you want to do since we're talking about it?

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Alright, I'll just briefly say what it was.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** You know how you talk about the things that you're into in the early stages?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:57]** But she was like, I just want to do that in a puddle of blood.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** But not joking.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** That was seriously what she wanted.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** Yikes.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** But there were also cameras everywhere in her house.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Alright.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** And she was always alone.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** I wonder where she is today.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** You're like 20 years old.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** How do you have a five bedroom house with cameras everywhere inside?

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** She's probably dead.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** I don't know.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Anyway.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:38]** this i've got dark i want this to be a movie this won't save me that's over you know definitely not so i can bring her in as an npc what was her name her name was eileen that come on eileen song which is a great song reminds me of her unfortunately i really like that song i love that song that's a great song but now i can't i can't sing it without thinking about that come on eileen yeah all right i would say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:38 - 00:06:07]** i think i was like way too young but i do love these movies but like the silence of the lambs like i probably saw that when i was like 11 or something i've never seen that one oh they're i mean they're great movies regardless of genre like or rather the first one is i know they ended up doing several of them yeah um i haven't seen that because i try to avoid but i want to because i've heard they're just so good it's probably worth it for a movie like that you know what i mean because it's the writing's probably incredible and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** It's so incredible.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** Yeah, the first one is the one that I'm thinking of the most.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** It's just a classic movie at this point.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Absolutely.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Not just a classic horror movie.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** The TV show Hannibal was really...

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:45]** up as well uh but good good good yeah yeah it's wild it is absolutely wild show but uh i don't do horror stuff and like john got me into that one and we ended up watching a ton of it it's it's wow i don't know if they i think they did a couple of seasons i'm not sure i haven't watched it in a while but it's one of the very few horror things that i was like this is this is really well made this is awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:07:09]** yeah when it's when it's well made i definitely agree with you it's easier to watch i'm also a bit of a baby but i also weirdly really like it like it creeps me out and i like the creepy part so what i'll do is i'll i'll because i don't always have time to watch all these movies is i'll i'll read the synopsis which which how do i keep forgetting about this john by the way anyone that that's a good thing to do no

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** I still have parts of Hereditary stuck in my head.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** See, I was going to mention Hereditary because that's one of my favorites.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:23]** But I would also see it because I don't remember the entire synopsis, but there are certain scenes that stick out that I'm like, okay, well now I want to see what it's like on screen.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** But you miss the entire experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** It's like reading Anna Karenina or whatever on a f***ing fortune cookie.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** Why don't you just do that as well while you're reading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:36]** Because I love creepypastas, and I sub to all the creepy accounts on all the socials.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** They're fun.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:59]** Okay, there's one movie, The Conjuring, that has this hide-and-seek scene that's incredible and totally freaked me out, and that's probably the scene that I think about when I think about something that's the scariest experience because it's a little kid playing hide-and-seek, and then the kid stops clapping, and the kid's playing with the mom, and then the mom's like, Rebecca, where are you?

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** And then she'll hear, like,

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:24]** you know and then like she'll like go into this room and then she'll be like oh not there and then she goes into one room and there's there's only a wardrobe in the room and she like she like looks and there's like a curtain and she thinks she sees her kid behind the curtain so she walks up and she's about to like open the curtain and then the wardrobe door like slowly opens and these like demonic hands come out and like

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:40]** they clap and it's so creepy it was like it's so good and then her kid is behind the curtain but then she like turns around so oh it's so good it's great all right i like it probably would have been good to see instead of read but i do get well okay you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:45]** Can you imagine how much more impactful it would have been?

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** Rather than my dramatic retelling.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** Right.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** I mean, dramatic retellings are kind of our specialty around here, aren't they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:04]** There have been, I mean, in the last 10 years, a lot of not just bullshit jump scare horror movies that have come out.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:09]** I'm behind on that list, but I do want to see Get Out.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** I haven't seen Midsommar.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Get Out was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Get Out seems...

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:35]** there's such a fine line between horror and thriller yeah get out get out to me it's like on the thriller side such a good movie so well written like left you hanging yeah yes john john in that genre i mean i'm not gonna do a dramatic retelling but nope oh i haven't seen that one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:10:00]** that is that in the same universe is that the sequel like what is that related to i i remove my my previous bid for creepiest scene because there is a scene that i that i saw and will stay with me and then i saw several accounts recently that were like this scene still staying staying in my head and i'm like i know it's weird so nope is good in that universe yeah really good yeah yeah that was another good one i haven't seen us either


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** So are all of Jordan Peele's horror movies, are they in sort of a shared universe?

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** I don't know.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** I haven't seen any of them.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** I don't know.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** That's a good question for the internet.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Or for our Discord.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** If you don't think it's for that, join our Discord.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Speaking of Discord, let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:21]** We'll have a dramatic reenactment channel where it's just posting the synopsis of horror movies.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** Mr. Garrett, you've been awfully quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:27]** No, I was just going to... John mentioned probably one of my favorites, which was Hereditary.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** It's...

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:35]** It's a blend of psychological terror and supernatural.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** The Shining, classic.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Classic.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Exorcist, classic.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Psycho, classic.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** The Ring, classic.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Oh, The Ring.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** Dude, The Ring, when it came out, I remember just... I think it was in high school.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** And yeah, that was like anything.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** That was the only thing anyone talked about for like a month.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I hated that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:04]** I hated doing so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** Liar Witch Project.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** Everyone was like, oh, I got sick watching it, but it's so scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:19]** This one kind of blends genres, but it feels like kind of appropriate to a little bit to the Old Gods of Appalachia.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Has anybody seen Bone Tomahawk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Oh, I've heard of it, though.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** With Kurt Russell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:26]** It's like a Western that becomes a horror movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** I want to see that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** I can't find that.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** It came out like 2015.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I've been meaning to see that.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** It's on my long list of movies that I will...

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** rarely actually watch one of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Also recently, Long Legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** I've heard Long Legs is very scary.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** I want to see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Is it about daddy Long Legs?

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Oh, is it Nicolas Cage?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** We'll just watch it for that reason.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** It's not going to be scary then.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** It's going to be hilarious.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** I hear it's good.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Are you saying Nicolas Cage is in this?

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** I don't see him anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** Oh, there he is.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:00]** We could also just not play Old Gods and do a live watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Right.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Well, you know, this is the left turn that I saw coming.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** So, you know, you guys have a good night.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** See you on the Discord.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** We watch old horror films.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** It's not a horror movie at all.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Nailed it.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** I want to see it just because it's Reeves, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** What is it?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Yeah, Legion.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** We talked about it this one time.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** I don't think that's horror either.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** It had elements of horror.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Let's see what IMDb says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Oh, where he's like an angel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Yeah, and he's trying to save.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** Action fantasy horror, according to IMDb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** It's the third one on the list.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** Also, a 5.3 out of 10, according to IMDb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** I enjoyed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Paranormal activity?

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** That one's a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** I haven't seen that one.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** That one might be a shade too scary for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** Dude, that actually did mess me up when I saw that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** Oh, Final Destination.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Those are the ones that truly f***ed me up.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Still won't drive behind a log truck.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Nope.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Nope.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Get nervous and drive through car washes.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Not on Ferris wheels.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Not on roller coasters.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Nope.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Tanning beds.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Tanning beds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:43]** weirdly enough i feel like the thing other than the log truck the thing that sticks out to me the most about and i don't remember which of those movies it was in but was like the guy goes and secludes himself in a cabin out in the woods and it's like the the fishing pole falls down and the hook gets caught like super tight on the line and it's like he catches it right before it's about to like rip his throat out it's like the fish hook yeah it sticks with me as much as anything else


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Yeah.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Did you ever watch Ghost Ship?

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Giving me the heebie-jeebies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Ghost Ship?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Yeah.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:54]** One of the best, for a cheesy horror movie, one of the best opening scenes ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** Is that where they all get sliced in half?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** The big freaking hook?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** That was wild.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Gross.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Cool.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** So what are we doing here?

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:08]** We're going to do a quick session zero for a game that none of us have ever played before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** And only literally one of us is prepared for it.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** So we apologize.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** And also, we're going to try to do regionally.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** Some of us are going to try to do regionally accurate accents.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** It's not going to be good, but we tried for you.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Okay.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** I just take that away from this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:29]** So we're playing Old Gods of Appalachia from Monty Cook Games.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** This is a cipher system game.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:51]** So fundamentally different from what we play in Pathfinder and what you guys might be used to in like 5e or something like that, where you only use a D20, a D6, and occasionally a D100.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** I have a website with these.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:02]** I got these really nice obsidian black dice from Norse Foundry while we were at Gen Con.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** I love them.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** I think they're dope.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:10]** But the other fundamental change is the players always roll.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** The GM should very rarely, if ever, roll anything.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:21]** So what that does is it allows you all to dictate the storyline.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** A couple changes fundamentally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** I picked this game for the lack of work it would make me do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** He literally, yeah.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** Shout out to you.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** I'll do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** We said a D20, D100, and a D6.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Yes.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Got it.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Unlock.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Let's go.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** I'm going to use my bullet die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Nice.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Those actually are pretty cool.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** They spin forever if you spin them like a top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:02]** You guys have the... You're all into unorthodox dice, you know?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Kelly...

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:23]** flipping his dice up and down and like catching them it just makes me nervous like every time he flips a die like throws one up in the air and then has to catch it and then like flip it over like a quarter yep like this yeah this is this is not the most efficient way to roll your dice but have fun i love him


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** So, we've got characters.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** We've got pre-generated characters.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:35]** I think John is going to spin up his own character from scratch.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** It has been spun.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Cool.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** So, fundamental differences.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** We don't have a health point pool.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** We don't have stamina or resolve.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:50]** We have three pools of personal resource.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** You've got might,

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** which represents strength and fortitude.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** You've got speed, which represents dexterity and agility.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:08]** And you've got intellect, which is all about mental and sort of that... Magics and stuff.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Yeah.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Intelligence and charisma.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:15]** If you want to adapt it from what we're used to.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:23]** So you have points in those pools that you can spend to activate your abilities.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** You can spend those to accomplish different goals.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** You have a system called effort.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** So if I want to actually, I'm going to backtrack and talk about that in just a minute.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:42]** So those pools are both your resource for using your abilities and also your health in that particular area.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:51]** So if you're walking through the woods and a tree falls on you, you're going to take damage to your might pool.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** Now, if something just says you take damage, you also take damage to mine.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Okay?

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Copy.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:04]** If you suffer a mental attack from some bit of magic, you'll take intellect damage.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Does that make sense so far?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Yeah, that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:13]** And if you go to the Olympics as Australia's best breakdancer, you will take speed damage, I assume?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** Yes, basically.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** And everyone else takes mental intellect damage.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Right.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** That was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** That was spectacular.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Have you seen the rest of her life?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** It was so hard to watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** Her and her husband's breakdancing videos.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Have you seen any of those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Oh, no.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** It's so much more of the same.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** The iconic kangaroo ender.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:44]** I can respect wanting to represent where you're from, but also not like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:45 - 00:20:08]** it looked like a t-rex to me but yeah yeah same i didn't realize it was supposed to be a kangaroo until somebody like said it on a video and i was like oh that at least not kind of makes sense i guess she did her best she did her absolute best god bless her uh bless her little heart um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:37]** bless her heart well bless her heart so you have a pool of resources right that pool of resources is how much of you that resource you can use different classes have different pool sizes so a protector has a really big mic pool a speaker has a really big intellect pool so on and so forth um on your character sheets you have your pool number and your edge number right

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:46]** So that edge means for each action you take, you can reduce the amount of that pool you have to spend by your edge.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:55]** As your character gains experience and moves through the rest of the tiers of a character, that edge will increase over time.

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:24]** an edge of zero what does that mean so that means you don't reduce it at all right if you want to spend from that pool to activate an ability you're going to spend whatever the number is so like if you have a might edge of zero and you want to open a rusty door the other thing aspect that's going to affect that is difficulty so cypher system has a difficulty from zero to ten and

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Zero means it's absolutely routine.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** You don't have to roll.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:31]** Ten means it's within the laws of physics, but just barely.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:36]** And so every action has a score between zero and ten.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:43]** So opening a steel rusty door is probably a difficulty four, difficulty five action.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** That difficulty number is what I come up with.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:50]** That number times three is what you have to roll.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:53]** Now, how is that number affected?

**[00:21:53 - 00:22:04]** If you spend effort, you can reduce the difficulty of that by one level for each level of effort you apply up to two levels.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** You'll have to re-explain this to me later.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:13]** If you have a might pool of 13 and it's a really big heavy door, you say, I want to apply effort.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:20]** You spend three points from your might pool and the difficulty changes from five to four, meaning your target number changes from 15 to 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** And then you roll a... And then you roll your d20.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** And whatever you get on the die is what you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** So if I have... Flat roll.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:34]** I have a might of 13 and an edge of one.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:34]** Right.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:40]** So I would spend three to reduce by three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:50]** So you would have since you have an edge of one, if you wanted to reduce the difficulty by one level, you would use one level of effort, which typically costs three.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** Since you have an edge of one, it only costs you two for that first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** And then you, I'm sorry.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** I didn't mean to cut you off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:22:59]** Yeah.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:08]** So if I have like, I have a speed of pool of 12 at an edge of zero, and let's say I needed to run somewhere quickly.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:14]** What would, and you know, you determine the difficulties like a, I don't know, five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Uh, how would I, how would that reduce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** So you would either five times three is 15.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** So you'd either have to roll 15 or higher, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:29]** Let's say I really wanted to make sure I was successful and I wanted to reduce it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:34]** So you can spend effort from your speed pool.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:40]** You could see if you or one of your colleagues has a cipher that allows you to move more quickly.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** You could do any number of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Got it.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:43]** Okay.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:46]** But how does the edge factor into that?

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** I'm trying to understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:51]** So if you wanted to use effort, it would cost you three points per level.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** So you could spend three points from your speed pool to reduce that difficulty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** And it wouldn't reduce because my edge is zero.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Correct.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Okay.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** Edge just reduces the amount of points you actually have to spend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:08]** So I'm more attuned to might by one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:16]** It's easier for you to spend from your might pool than someone who doesn't have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:22]** From reading a little bit over the player's guide, the pool represents your raw, innate...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:38]** ability in that thing and your edge is like how to actually utilize the tools and the skills necessary to use it right yep very cool now it it becomes nuanced and the rule is you apply edge once per action

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:50]** So if you wanted to reduce it by two levels, because each level of effort is three points and you only get to use your edge once per action, your first level only costs you two because you use your edge.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** Your second level costs you the full three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:57]** So speaking of that, correct me if I'm wrong.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:05]** I was reading very quickly through this, but I thought it said for edge, your first level is three and every level thereafter is two.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** That's what I thought too.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** That's backward.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** What do you mean?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Like it normally costs three.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** I mean effort, not edge.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** Your effort, it costs three the first time.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** It costs two every time thereafter.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** But you can only do effort as many times as your level.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** So we're level one, so it won't matter.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** We can only do it once anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Yeah, I see that on page 18.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** Each level of effort after the first costs only two points from the stat pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** Those are some highfalutin ideas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** It begins, everyone.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Send us your hate mail.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** You're absolutely right.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** I did not read that correctly.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** Thank you, Heath.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** I didn't do much research.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** I just did the right research.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Right.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** He made it to page 20, people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** You did way more research than I did, which was I skimmed it.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** I was like, I still don't see where it says how to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** It basically doesn't.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** So then I read that, and I was like, well, we're going to wing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Right.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** The basic game loop is I want to do a thing.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** What do I spend?

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** Well, you want to do a thing.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:14]** Okay.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** Give me a such and such roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:23]** And then you roll against whatever arbitrary difficulty is assigned to the task.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** And then we move the story forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:36]** Definitely more rules light because the role is not necessarily tied to the action as granularly as Starfinder or D20 systems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** This is probably great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:47]** The idea with this system is if you've got a task, it should be the same difficulty for anyone and everyone.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:56]** But if a character is more suited to that task, someone who has been a miner their whole life,

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:15]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:24]** So would that be on you as the GM to lower the DC requirement because of their background in mining?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:28]** So in that case, we would have a look at character sheets.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:34]** If you go to, and I'm going to pull it up because I can't picture one in my head right this second.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:40]** If you look in the bottom left corner of that first page, there's skills.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** Yeah.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:47]** So there are three layers for skills.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** There are three tiers.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** There's trained, which reduces the difficulty by one.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:55]** There's specialized, which reduces the difficulty by two.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** And then there's inability, which makes it more difficult by one.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:06]** So if you're specialized in mining, you would tell me that you're specialized in mining and you're going to use that skill.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** I know the difficulty is then reduced by however many layers.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:19]** I love that I'm a sage and I have an inability to use magic.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:24]** You said I is plus one difficulty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** There's a pool column, and then there's a T, S, and I column.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** And I see checkboxes in the T, S, I. What's the pool column about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:45]** So the pool you'll see is either I or S or M. Those coincide with the pools that you would be using to, say, apply effort.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** So like music is related to the intellect pool.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Oh, I see.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Speed defense is related to the speed pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Oh, okay.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** That makes sense.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** That's really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Yep.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Love it.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** So let's talk about the damage track real quick.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** So, you know, dying or dead.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** If you have pool left in all three pools, you're fine.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:17]** As each of these pools approaches zero, you are more and more damaged, right?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** We kind of talked about that at the top.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:26]** If one of those pools gets to zero, you move down the damage track from normal to impaired and impaired.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** You get plus one effort.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** Um, where is this trying to zoom in so that I can read it?

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Plus one effort per level, plus one effort per level.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** So effort costs one more point.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:43]** Um, you ignore major and minor effect results on roles.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** I'll tell you about those in just a second.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** And then combat roles are 17 to 20 only do one extra damage.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:57]** If your might pool goes to zero, then you're just like, all you can do is crawl.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Same with your speed pool.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** I think I'll have to double check that in the rule book.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** If your intellect goes to zero, then you just pass out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** Um, Oh, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Sorry.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** So you become impaired when one of your pools goes to zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Got it.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** You become debilitated when two of your pools go to zero.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Got it.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** And you die when all three of your pools go to zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Ah.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Yeah.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** Ah, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:30]** So, like, if you're fighting an enemy, they will damage a pool.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Yes.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Right?

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** One of your pools.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** Okay, so your pool represents your ability.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** I'm just kind of going over the basics on my own here.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Yep.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:47]** But your pool, you will use skills and do actions and spin from your pools, but also your pools can be damaged by enemies hitting you.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** So that's how you could kill.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:56]** Because initially I was still at a mental block of like, okay, the only way to do anything with the pool is to do actions.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** Why would I do so many actions that I kill myself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Right.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:04]** But I was not factoring in that enemies are going to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Well, and it kind of makes sense realistically.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:13]** If I spend all of my might, if I'm outside moving rocks and digging in the yard all day and somebody- Shoveling hay.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Right.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Shoveling hay.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Being a miner.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Mining coal.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Mining the anthracite.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** Working the cows or whatever.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:48]** working the cows work them cows work them yeah cow worker roger is it worth it cow let me work put that thing down flip it and uh and work it some more and work you know if i spend my might in that area someone comes by and like sucker punches me i'm out cold like because i've already spent my might out in the field

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** that last hit is going to put me down.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Got it.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** So, um, let's talk about how we recover from these.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** That's what I was going to ask.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:04]** So you notice the box that says recovery rolls, your recovery for all of these characters, I believe is one D six plus your tier, which is one.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** So we're used to long rest, short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** This model is, I actually really like, so your first recovery you can do in one action.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:22]** So if we're in combat and you want to roll recovery, you roll your D6, you add your tier.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** That's how many points you can add to in whatever combination to your pools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Oh, nice.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** Okay, it's not like specific to a certain pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:39]** So if I get a 7, I can add like 5 to might and 2 to intellect or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Or 3, 2, and 2, however you want to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** Can you go above your existing pool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** No.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:48]** Your existing max is your max.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Okay.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Anything you roll above that goes off into the ether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** The first time you do it, it takes one action.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** The second time, it takes 10 minutes.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** The third time, it takes an hour.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** And the fourth time, it takes 10 hours.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:07]** Those reset after one night of sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Okay.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:16]** So, I mean, realistically, if you would only ever do the fourth one, the 10-hour one, you're going to take a rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Yeah.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** But once you take that 10-hour rest, the other three reset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Yeah.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Got it.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** It's cool that you get a one-action recovery, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** That is cool.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** So, let's talk about combat.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:38]** So we've got every NPC in this book has a level.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** That level is basically that creature's difficulty.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:53]** So when you attack that creature, you make whatever related attack roll, whether it's might, speed, or intellect, against that creature's difficulty.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Right?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** That's normal.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** We're used to rolling against AC, right?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Right.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:06]** now conversely when that creature is attacking you guys you as the players are rolling to defend

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:13]** However you're trying to evade that, whether you're trying to grab it and wrench whatever out of its hand, that's going to be a might roll.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** If you're trying to dodge out of the way, it's going to be speed defense.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:24]** If you're trying to use your wits to outsmart it, if you can convince me that that's legit, we might make it an intellect roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** Every single time I'm going to use intellect to tell you, hey, don't throw that.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Don't hit me with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:42]** Um, I have a skill here on my sheet called intellect defense in which I am specialized.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Yep.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:50]** I'm guessing that's because I have a low intellect and I don't know, but you're specialized in intellect defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Yes.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:56]** So in, in that case, specialized reduces the difficulty by two tiers, right?

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** So it's easier for me to defend?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** Yes.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:09]** So if I make an intellect attack against your character, if my NPC is a level five, for you, that becomes a level three roll.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Nice.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** And a level three roll is a target number of?

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** You took the words right out of my mouth.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:48]** the target the target role is always three times the difficulty okay yep just remember three okay yep everything is three we're just trying to hit threes or above all night and we'll be good perfect um so oh I picked a bad character sheet to open hang on like an evil character sheet to open like a like a bad one um like it comes out it's like I have another question added to my sheet bad like shaft is bad huh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** That's sort of, I guess it's related to combat.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Unless it means something else.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Yeah.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:04]** I have a skill of initiative, which is a speed pool in which I'm trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** How does initiative work?

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** I'm so glad you asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** So glad you asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Man, tickled.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I'm just great at segues, aren't I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Tickled pink.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** I appreciate you teeing me up for that.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** So let's talk about initiative.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** We're used to everyone rolling their initiative score.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:28]** With Old Gods, it really only matters whether you go before or after the NPC.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** I could do it in a complicated way if I wanted to.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** I'm going to make all the NPCs go at once.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** I'll just let you know that now.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:38]** And so each round, it's going to be you two get to go before the NPC...

**[00:36:38 - 00:37:01]** you two get to go after or whomever gets to roll now just like i said before the players always roll the npcs don't roll anything and so okay everyone's gonna roll say it's a level five creature if you roll at a 15 or above you go first if you roll below a 15 you go after but since will is is it trained or specialized


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Specialized.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** No, trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** Since it's trained, Will's target number becomes 12.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** Because he has that extra experience with initiative because he's super quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** As shown on camera, really fast.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** Faster than the frame rate.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** So fast.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** He's fast as fuck, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** He did the John Cena.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** You can't see me.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** He did the John Cena.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:31]** Man, you went to the bathroom and you're back so quick.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** I will add in as much as I legally can of that drop.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:43]** So let's talk about attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:47]** I think you're good unlimited times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:48 - 00:38:18]** i think you're right i think that that is what it is that's why i want the pokemon music to be there whenever it comes out thanks for doing that so far i want to be the favorite yeah it's usually just it's usually just the drum fill and then that's all you need and that's it that's it that's it that's the best part besides okay that's the best part yeah so let's talk about damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** We're used to weapons having damaged dice.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** In this game, weapons have a flat damage.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Okay.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** Alrighty.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** Now, that can be modified by what you happen to roll.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** In combat, if you roll a 17, you get plus one damage.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:44]** If you roll an 18, I'm going to thumb through my book here on combat.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** If you roll an 18, it's plus 18 damage.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Nailed it.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** That's probably right.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Times three, right?

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** So it's 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Or what's 18 times three, 54?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** I apparently can't spell combat.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Cool.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Page 10.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** So, if you roll an 18...

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** I think it's plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** So just one more for everyone?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:10]** Like, 17's plus one, 18's plus two, 19's plus three, 20's plus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** It's a little bit more nuanced than that.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Oh, okay.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:21]** You get a... If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you add one or two additional points, right?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** If you roll a 19, you can either get plus three, or you can get a minor effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Hmm.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** We collectively agree on what that minor effect is.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:40]** Examples could be, hey, you stabbed them right in the eye and they're blinded for one round.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** You knocked the wind out of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Until their eye heals back.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:51]** Or until you cut them just above their eye and they've got to clear all the blood out or whatever.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** So something temporary.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Yeah.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:58]** If you roll a 20, you get a major effect.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** That would be like cutting off a limb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:05]** Like stabbing their eye out would be a major effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Or maybe you shatter their weapon.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Something significant like that.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Cool.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:15]** If you roll a 1, I get something called a GM intrusion.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Intrusion.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Rude.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** So that means... You guys stop having fun.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** GM's here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:47]** that means the luck is not in your favor so in that example you might um additional reinforcements might show up or you know maybe if we're fighting in a burning building maybe the roof starts to collapse and you know what whatever circumstances these intrusions are far more intrusive than i thought they would be oh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** I thought it was like, you pocket sand yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** No.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** Very, very flavorful crit fails, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** They're spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** You could do that to us, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I could.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:05]** You slip and fall and take a spike to the back of the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** No, let's not go that far.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** That was too much intrusion.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** Like my beast nibbles on my hand instead of someone else or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:19]** Every time that I get a minor effect, I'm going to do pocket sand, but I want it to be flavored as Kool-Aid.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** It's like Kool-Aid packets.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:28]** And the intrusion is that a monster bursts through a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:35]** A giant glass, open-topped, liquid-filled monster.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:40]** That's it.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Inexplicably happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Creepily happy.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** How do you earn experience points?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:58]** We're used to that being the sum total of CR for the monsters that we've defeated in a given part of the adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:04]** Or the sum total of getting past a certain point the GM has decided.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Some arbitrary benchmark, yeah.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** Definitely not something that we've ever done before.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** Nope.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** In this game, experience points are incredibly fluid.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:34]** meaning I could at any point in time introduce a GM intrusion say you're trying to swim across a river I could say you know hey actually while you're swimming you feel a hand grab your ankle and pull you under the water what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Parkinson's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** And... I die.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** That's what I do.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** You die, but you die with 2 XP.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** And so, when that happens, when I intrude, I give you two experience points.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** You keep one, you gift one to somebody else around the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Oh, that's neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** So...

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** But just one person?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** You've got to play favorites?

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Basically.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** Each intrusion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** That's the soft antagonism of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Basically.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:17]** So if someone threw you a rope to get you out of the river, then it would make sense for you to keep one and give it to the person that helped you out.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** Somebody made a particular joke that you liked that night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:26]** You could absolutely **** on them and just intentionally snub them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** You saved me from that river.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** I'm going to give this to the guy who's back at the house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:35]** He's already full up on hit points and everything.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Or all on his pools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** That's one way to earn experience points.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:45]** Another way is, as we talked about briefly before we started recording, character arc development.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** So each character has their own arc that they are pursuing.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:59]** And any steps taken toward either setting up or completing a step toward that arc are rewarded with experience points.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** Um, notice that no part of what I talked about was combat.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Combat does not reward experience points directly.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Hmm.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** So now how do you spend experience points?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Real easy.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:20]** If you want to reroll any role, you spend one XP to do it.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Now that role does not have to be your role.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** It could be somebody else's role.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:40]** So if John has XP and Heath rolls a two to hit a bad guy, John could spend his XP to re-roll that and complete whatever mission we're on.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** Cool.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Does that make sense so far?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** But do your XP points not...

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** So you don't have levels, you have tiers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** So how do you move along the tiers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Did I miss a part?

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Do you not have to cash in the XP for the tier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** That's what I was working toward.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Redoing rolls is one way to spend XP.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:12]** Another way is if I come up with a GM intrusion, you can spend an XP to basically null it out.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Now, you don't get one, you don't give one, you spend one to get rid of it.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:27]** You can spend two XP to give you a skill that gives you a short-term or medium-term ability.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** Example, there are skills to be able to track animals, generally speaking.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** That's a skill that you would have to spend 4 XP as part of the level up process.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** We'll get to that in just a little bit.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:51]** But if we are spending a lot of time in this particular wood, you could say, you know, I've spent a lot of time around this lake and I fished on this lake a whole lot with my parents as I grew up.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** And so I know the fish in this lake really well.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** It doesn't apply to all bodies of water.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** It doesn't apply to all fishing.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** It just applies to that one specific thing.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** So you could spend 2 XP to gain something like that.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Let's see.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Use 1 XP to reroll any rolls.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** That tracks.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** You're going to spend 1 XP to refuse GM intrusion.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** No.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** No.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:26]** The longer-term benefit is to spend 3 XP to either gain a long-term NPC.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** I'm in page 165 of the handbook if you want to skim along with me.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:35]** You can use that to establish a contact in the city that you're in.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:40]** You could use that to establish a home or a title or position in the community.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:45]** You can spend 3 XP to gain some sort of wealth.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:51]** Some wealthy forefather of yours died and you're the next of kin that's alive.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:57]** So you no longer have to worry about daily expenses to keep your whatever up.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:04]** Now, you can spend four XP to start advancing your character.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** How do you do that?

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** There are four actions.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:16]** that you can take to move your character from one tier to the next.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** You have to take each of these four actions with one asterisk.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** Those four actions are, one, increasing capabilities.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** So you get four points to add to your pool.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** You move toward perfection.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** You add one to any of your edges, might, speed, or intellect.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** You gain extra effort.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Your effort score increases by one.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:51]** Or you choose a skill that you already know to go from specialized to trained or from nothing to trained.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** No, trained to specialized or nothing to trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Increase a step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Basically.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** Yeah.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** There are also other options...

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:08]** where you can add two to your recovery rolls, pick another focus ability.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** This is only available at Tier 3 or Tier 6.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** You can reduce the cost for armor.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** But at Tier 1, you basically have to take those four steps.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:26]** Once you've completed all four of those steps, your character then goes from Tier 1 to Tier 2.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:33]** once you're at tier two, you repeat those four steps again to get to tier three, so on and so forth.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** And those are sort of the air quotes levels.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Cool.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:45]** Now the, the equal advancement, um, like once you've chosen one for a tier, you can't choose it again.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** So like you can't just stockpile capabilities.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** You can't just keep adding stuff to your pool.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:55]** You can do that once and then do the next thing and then do the next thing until you get to the next tier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Keeps you honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Yeah.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** So that'll make sense so far.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Yeah.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Yeah.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:07]** There are a bunch of sample character arcs starting on page 167.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:15]** If you want to pick one of those before our next session, I can do my best to work that into the story.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** I have one written on my sheet.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Awesome.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** I believe you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** It's justice.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:25]** You try to write a wrong or bring a wrongdoer to justice.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:31]** Do you have a specific wrong in mind or do we want to just figure that out on the fly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:46]** I mean, I had, I had a thought, but I think we'd rather just, I'd like to see where the story goes first before I start picking and choosing rats and wrongs to write.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Yeah.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Cool.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** And just any old wrong.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** We've got to be intentional about the wrongs that we write.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** It's a hard road to hoe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:06]** So, oh, let's talk about range since we kind of moved on from combat, but I think we can get to talk about it.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** So, we're used to measuring range in feet very exactly.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Old God's super loosey-goosey.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** There are basically four ranges.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:24]** There's immediate, which is if you're in a room or within 10 feet, you're in immediate range.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:32]** The presumption is if you're in a melee scrap, you're within immediate range of just about everybody.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:38]** There's short range, which is basically anything outside of immediate out to about 25 feet.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:44]** There's medium range, which is about 25 to 100 feet.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** Theirs' long range was about 100 to 500 feet.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** So, super fast and loose with ranges.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:55]** Those of you with ranged weapons will see that those weapons have a range.

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** Shotgun, short range, so you can shoot basically within 25 feet.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** I'll tell you what range people are in if you can see them or perceive them in any other way.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:21]** um combat is also not a center of this gaming system in case that part wasn't abundantly clear already cool i think that's it for game rules sweet do you guys want to talk about your characters


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** Nah.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** I did have a question about the characters.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:37]** I don't know if it's been mentioned since we've been on today, but the Old Gods of Appalachia is based on a podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Yes.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** Um, podcast called the old God of Appalachia.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:48]** Um, it's, it's actually a really well done radio drama of like this alternate Appalachia through the early 1900s.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** Um, really well produced.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Uh, I've enjoyed listening to it.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:01]** I mean, I very much want to check it out now, uh, having some, you know, experience and foot in the door with it, but yeah,

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:05]** What I was curious about is, so there were some pregens that came with this.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:08]** Are those like characters on the podcast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** It depends on which pregens you were looking at.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:16]** So there are four pregens that come with the player's guide from their website.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Which I picked one.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** There are six pregens that came with this particular adventure.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:27]** So the one that Kelly grabbed came from this adventure.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Which one did you grab, Heath?

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Ira Murphy.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Also came from this adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** Okay, so it's not a character on the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Yeah, that's correct.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** And Wills wasn't named.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** So no, we're not playing anybody from the podcast.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Oh, cool.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** That's probably good.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:52]** It's actually explicitly stated in the book that this is based on the world in the podcast, but it is not the same world as the world in the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:52 - 00:53:03]** Yeah, it's interesting because you don't – or at least I haven't seen many things that are like –

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:09]** That is like, hey, we're inspired by the world of, but interpret it how you will.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** And I liked one line that they used.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:20]** They were like, if it helps, think of every time you sit down to start a game or like your session zeros or whatever.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:25]** When you sit down, you're making an alternate of the alternate universe, right?

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** Like you're splitting off another version of that reality, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:49]** yeah that's cool multiverse continues indeed they actually just launched yesterday on backer kit in case anyone wants to back them because I think it's a really cool game something called deeper still which is going to be three additional source books oh cool yeah their their initial goal was like

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** $10,000.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** I backed them yesterday when they were at $100,000.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** I think today they're at $300,000.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:04]** I think they'll meet their goal.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** I think so.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** They're at 437,000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Oh, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** Their next stretch goal is at 500, which is 16 or 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** Well, they'll be there in two hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** So it closes in like three weeks.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** So there's a lot of buzz for this game.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:26]** Yeah, I mean, I'm excited to get in on the ground floor.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** And to that point, I was going to say, didn't you want us to talk about our characters?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Since I already named mine, I'll talk about mine.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** Go for it.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** All right.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:47]** I am playing one of the pregens that I found called Ira Murphy, who is a shifty sage who knows the unknowable.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** I don't know how, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:51 - 00:55:11]** meta you want me to get do i need to talk tell you about their stats or skills or um so shifty shifty sages who know the unknowable did you dive into the the handbook at all on what any of that means no i read what i could of the player's guide you know awesome uh so shifty

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:17]** As characters are created in Old Gods of Appalachia, you give them a name, of course.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:27]** And the way you set up your classes and sort of who your character is and how they operate is using a descriptor type who focus.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:35]** So the shifty descriptor is... I'll go ahead and kind of skim that.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:41]** You're the first to say you're neither sneaky nor sly, or more likely, you're the only one to say it.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Um...

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:49]** Your friends probably love the way you can talk your way around anything, get into anywhere, just find the thing you need in somebody else's pocket.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** But everyone else, not so much.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** That's okay.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** You know how to get everything you need.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:57]** So, with the shifty descriptor, you get plus two to your intellect pool.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:03]** You're trained in all tasks involving manual dexterity, such as stealing, sleight of hand.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** You're trained in everything dealing with persuasion and bluffing.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:13]** You get a couple of additional items...

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:17]** You begin the game with a $1 script and a sleight of hand item.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:24]** And your initial link to the adventure is based on sort of what that is.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Your type.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** On what the sleight of hand item is?

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** On you being shifty.

**[00:56:30 - 00:57:00]** oh okay um so i'll have to go write some of that in okay your type is basically your class so a sage is like uh um you could think of them almost like a like a witch doctor you know they're they're gonna take making poultices and and taking herbs and um other vegetation mixing it together maybe saying a few words over them and using them to do things that that

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:20]** could be considered medicine could be considered magic um with that adeptness also comes uh the ability to use that for harm where you can make not just poultices and healing items but also deadly poisons poisons poisons like a brouhaha

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** And your focus is Knows the Unknowable, which I have not seen.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:31]** I love that Knows Jack is one of the focuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** It's so cool.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** They have such cool focuses.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** That was just a joy to read them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Where are these focuses listed?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Because I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:40 - 00:58:04]** they're not the players guy it's it's like adobe acrobat cannot find like i'm pretty it's like a succinct it's in the handbook yeah so it's in the handbook which is there we tried not to read too far ahead in that because no just just go through like chapter seven you're fine to do anything in the handbook through like the the last two chapters are adventures


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:27]** so anything else you want to peruse in there be my guest so if you want to be a good player read the adventure beforehand well no one wants to do that yeah that's why no one read it so but go on go on so if you want to have a look at the handbook it's on the google drive link i sent in the discord it's also in old god's appellation handbook under books under books


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:32]** I mean, I just want to know what defend what matters means.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** They're all cool.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:40]** So knowing the unknowable, I actually haven't read through most of these because I had to skip a chapter or two in order to finish the book.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** You can know things.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** You might say some things that are better left buried, but that's not how you see it at all.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** You want to know, name, and categorize all the things you come across as

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:58]** So you're just super curious and you just try to learn everything.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** Okay.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** I'm into that.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** And then you get different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Particularly poisonous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:09]** You get different abilities based on what tier your character is.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** So tier one, you get two intellect points.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** Or you can spend two intellect points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** So cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:46]** to like study or observe a creature an object or a location for at least one round and then the next time you try to interact with it or something related to it the um whatever it is is eased so if it's a difficulty five it's only a difficulty four for you and what was your character's name again peace ira murphy ira murphy i regret it doesn't that just roll off the tongue ira murphy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Ira Murphy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** Cool.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:52]** I'm looking forward to getting to know Ira.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Anybody else want to go?

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Who wants to go next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** I can go.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** So I have a Zoa Green.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** Zoa Green is a clever explorer who calls home the hounds.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:14]** And because I care about knowing about this game, I looked up in the big book, I can't remember the name of, to say you have a way with animals and non-human creatures doesn't begin to cover it.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** So he's really, really good with...

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:46]** animals he's a ranger so it kind of makes sense so he's like a forest ranger and he grew up in these parts these here parts but one of the cool things that he can do is he can summon a beast companion which is kind of awesome and i can make it look however i want it to be as long as it's my size or smaller at level one or tier one at tier one uh it's just a special ability yeah so i can use it whenever i picked the wrong character i know i was weighing between yours and mine but this was the reason where i was like yeah i'm going with this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Well, I mentioned this before we recorded.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** You haven't gotten the ciphers and stuff, but I was looking at things.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** I didn't know what they did, and I saw beast shape.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** Okay, yeah, I'm going to do that one.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** It's like, oh, you won't be able to do this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** For a little bit, yeah, for sure, at least.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** Yeah, it looked cool, though, I got to say.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Just become like a giant bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** It's all good.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:12]** I'm just going to focus on being a shady piece of shit.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** who really likes poisons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** Poisons.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Poisons.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** I dig it.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** Go ahead, John.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:41]** I could be thinking of a different game, but I could have sworn that when I was doing some reading, the game talks about how your levels in the game are less like you are... Like, yes, you're getting stronger, but the game is more like a snapshot of you at a certain place in your life.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:45]** So it would make sense that you would start with the ability to have this creature companion.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:51]** It's not like you're starting out being totally nascent to the world with no experience.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** You already have experience...

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:56]** In fact, your character could have decades of experience, right?

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** And then that would lead you to being at a certain tier.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** So it's like a snapshot of where you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** Anyone could have a dog, you know?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** You know what?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Or a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** And that's exactly what it is.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:12]** Your special abilities, and we'll look through these in just a second.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:38]** the last word in that is enabler so like you have that ability when you start so we you and i should probably talk about who you want your beast companion to be if you've got some ideas already can i just get a new one each time is it possible because it doesn't say you can't oh wait yeah it says like if your beast companion dies you can hunt in the wild to find a new one so could i just get like a salamander one day and like you know like a possum another day or like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:44]** You're like Appalachian Snow White where the birds come and help you fold your laundry and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Yeah, all right.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** I'm going to run with that for sure.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:51]** I want this to be my flavor as much as allowable.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** You have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:57]** Yeah, let's talk about that because you skipped the part where it says you hunt 1D6 days to find a new one.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:01]** Yeah, I did intentionally do that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** That omission was premeditated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Gotta follow the rules, Kevin.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Come on.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** My name is not Kevin.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** Please blame the rule not following on him, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** You did explicitly kick off.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:23]** Because I am trying to read the rules and run the rules and read the rule book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:28]** I mean, I just realized there's an entire handbook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Oh, man.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** There's a whole book, dude.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]** I just looked it up, man.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** This is what took me a week to get through.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:42]** This and The Adventure.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** Just haven't put it down.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** It's great reading.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** Yeah, it's crazy.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Very cool.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** Did you buy that book at Gen Con?

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** Oh, cool.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Very cool.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:57]** Yeah, we did the demo, and I immediately bought the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Oh, that's right.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]** You mentioned that in the...

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** the loaded up van on the way back.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** I think the last day of the car.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:05]** That's cool.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** Share of experiences.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Yep.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:13]** The van that had the totally perfectly legal limit of people inside.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** Yes.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** It's great.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** Always.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** Yes.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Always.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** We follow the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** Yes, we do.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** We follow most of them.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Oh, this is something you're going to want to know.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:24]** So you have your weapon is a rifle, right?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** Your rifle has long range.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:26]** Yeah.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]** So you can hit anyone within long range, right?

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:36]** But as we've talked about range increments, you've got immediate, short, medium, and long.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** Okay.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:45]** So anything under two levels of... Let me look up this rule on this.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:52]** Anything two levels or under, I think you get something called point-blank shot, which eases your ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:56]** Distance, immediate distance.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:56]** Is that what you talked about?

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:00]** So it's immediate, short, and long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** There's no medium.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Point blank range.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:08]** If a target uses a ranged weapon against a target within immediate range, the attack is eased.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:08]** That's what it is.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:14]** So if you have your rifle out and you shoot somebody in immediate range, it's one level easier.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** That's cool.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:20]** So keep that in mind as you shoot at bad guys.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:22]** Awesome.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** All right, Zoa Green.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Cool.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:30]** Zoa Green, the clever explorer who calls home the hounds.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:30]** Awesome.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Two more.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** John, Will's taking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Sure.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:46]** I'm playing the pre-gen from the Player's Guide, who is unnamed, but I have named Cold Ward.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:47]** Cold Ward.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:52]** Who is a gracious protector who defends what matters.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:53]** That's so dope.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:57]** I think of him as an Appalachian Captain America.

**[01:05:59 - 01:05:59]** Yeah.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** Captain Appalachian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:04]** That would be Captain Moonshine, I believe.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:07]** Captain Moonshine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** That's canon now.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** He's got a bunch of cool abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:17]** His moonshine still is the thing that matters that he defends.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** He's very generous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** Altruistic.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:27]** I feel like he's just a hard-working handyman kind of guy.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:37]** who's known around town, who is part of the community, community activist, has special ability.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:41]** Um, courageous is another ability.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** Altruistic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** Um, it's all sounds like a bootlegger to me.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** Good old boy.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Yeah.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:59]** And, um, one of the things that I saw though, that was interesting was in the defends what matters.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** Yeah.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** Uh, there's a, uh,

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:23]** piece that says like you have to pick one of these it actually has it picked in my character sheet and i kind of like it i think it fits for what we're doing here which is uh pick one other pc this character claimed innocence during a long ago event and you protected them

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** Now, that time has passed.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** You're not entirely convinced that they were blameless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:34]** I think that works for... That sounds like it might have been my character.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** Yeah.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** Hands down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:40]** Somebody poisoned the well at that village nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** No, I didn't murder anybody.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** I would never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]** I don't know about you.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Nora?

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** I like that.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** What is it, Noah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** It sounds like you know exactly about her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Ira.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** Yeah.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** Ira, I don't know about you.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** Cole.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:56]** Cole.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** Cole Ward.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** Cole Ward.

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** Cole Ward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:01]** I'm just a simple pause, you know?

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** I mean, Sage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** Pause.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:07]** Oh, this is going to be fun.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** All right.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:09]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:12]** Ira, Zoa, and Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:17]** I'm going to write your names down because I don't see them on a screen in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:21]** Well, I did put a link to notes in the docs.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** They have a much more popular Discord.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** It's popping off.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:46]** That's true.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** There's always stuff going on.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** There's always something popping off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** The more the merrier.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]** Definitely come hang out with us.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:57]** And then you'll hear us numerous times say, go hang out with Will Save.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:01]** And you'll get caught in a feedback loop of us telling you to check each other out, you know?

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** You'll never be free.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** I'm here for the positive feedback.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** You'll never be free of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]** Oh, Zoa has an H in it.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:08]** I need to note that.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:10]** All right.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** Yeah, so I made my character.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** I didn't do a pre-gen.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:17]** Benny told me we decided to do this, and I was like, all right.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:20]** And my brain just started going, and I thought of a character, and I was like, all right, cool.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:33]** So I'll be playing Julius Legrand, who is a mystical speaker who cannot escape the darkness.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:43]** Julius is the funeral director at the local Whispering Pines mortuary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** Better keep your powder dry around, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:52]** There's just a lot of pauses that we see come through here.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:56]** I really enjoy the mystical – like speaker is exactly what you think, right?

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:00]** Like a speaker is someone gifted with a magic tongue.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:08]** But what I like is that it doesn't – the type doesn't limit you to just using that.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:13]** Like a lot of your words can have – can affect might as well as intellect.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:22]** And there's a lot of flexibility in what you choose and whether you're using your words to help people or as an aggression.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** towards some sort of combatant.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:30]** Mystical is interesting and kind of self-explanatory.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:35]** You think of yourself as a mystical attuned with the mysterious and the magical.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:47]** The fun part is cannot escape the darkness because you are haunted by a deep and endless shadow, a violent and destructive force that swirls within you always.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:52]** It's not evil, but it's ancient and all-knowing and more powerful than you can understand.

**[01:10:54 - 01:11:00]** So there's a whole lot of different things you can do with that, with darkness and visibility and things like that.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** Some pretty sweet abilities.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:14]** But I think it just made sense for a funeral director who, I mean, Whispering Pines Mortuary is well regarded, let's say.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** Can you speak with dead?

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** Is that something Mr. Legrand can do?

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:23]** The speaker is one of the few, I think, classes that allows you to speak with dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:46]** that's so cool with i read that other character pre-gen and it was like speaks in tongues i think it's one of those that's also one that could be fun right like there's there's so much that you can do with a speaker and it's really it's really cool my immediate thought is like ira is going to be very nervous about which dead you're speaking to lest you find out about his poisons


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:53]** Oh my goodness.

**[01:11:54 - 01:12:09]** To go back to the point with Cole, I always love in any kind of TTRPGs or games like this, when there is a mechanic or something set up in the classes that leads to a cool character connection, right?

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:15]** And so you had the whole thing, like you defended somebody and then now you're not sure if they were innocent to begin with.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** The...

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:21]** I don't know if all of yours have these because I don't know.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** Some people have free gens, some don't.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:39]** But in the background section, under the bottom, it's all about you had a friend or two who made you feel really special and felt seen and heard and welcomed and had a special bond with when you were a kid.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** So I was like, oh, well, that's perfect.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:41]** Yeah.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:48]** Ira and Cole, like, grew up together, but as they got older, he became a shifty sage poisoner.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:52]** And, you know, you became, like, Captain Moonshine.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:56]** So it's like, we grew up together, but I don't know about him, you know?

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** Captain Moonshine.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** It sticks, man.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** It sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Yeah, it does.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:02]** Uh...

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** Cool.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:11]** Yeah, there's one connection in the Cannot Escape the Darkness that I don't think I'm going to choose this one.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:14]** I'll reach out to you all with some of the other ones, but I do like it.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:18]** You're certain this character appreciates your abilities and is impressed by them.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** This may or may not actually be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:44]** i just think it's so you're convinced like one of us is like really enamored you know just enamored with how talented you are yeah yeah i'm not gonna choose that one but it's just it's it's just funny it's just cool loving it cool i mean is there anything else you guys want to talk about with your characters do we want to do on a rap session zero and then do a quick session one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]** I think I'm ready for that, Jess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:54]** Yeah, I was trying to look through the character arcs and see if I could kind of pick one on the fly.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:55]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:59]** I'd be tickled to death to get this adventure underway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:02]** I say let's wrap session zero here.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:10]** We'll grab character arcs in the interim, and then at the top of session one, we'll talk about those and dive right into it.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:11]** Nice.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** Does that sound good?

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** Sounds good.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:13]** Yeah.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** Awesome.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** Session zero in the books.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:19]** Old gods of Appalachia coming at you.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** Won't save.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Won't save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:34]** We didn't even talk about, like, I mean, obviously the setting is Appalachia, but, like, the creepy magics and the old gods part of the old gods of Appalachia.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:35]** The inner dark.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:39]** There's this whole, you know, great old ones kind of thing.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** We'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:40 - 01:15:06]** that's like the one part that i really took away it was cool that the lore behind it is is the only thing i remembered coming into today because it's that good like yeah it's tennessee lovecraft you know yeah yeah i was doing research on the region and like there are caves in appalachia that don't have bones because the caves existed before bones did yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:10]** Yeah, the Appalachian mountain range is incredible.

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** It's old, dude.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:14]** It's more like ground down than the Rockies.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:17]** The Rockies are taller and sharper.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:20]** Up here on the west coast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]** There's some mold in them hills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:29]** No prehistoric bones, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:32]** And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:34]** Thank you guys so much for a great session zero.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:37]** We'll come right back with session one.

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:39]** And we're off to the races, gentlemen.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:42]** Let's go meet some old gods, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:44]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:45]** At tier one?

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:46]** What?

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:50]** I'm going to need some weaker enemies than old gods.
