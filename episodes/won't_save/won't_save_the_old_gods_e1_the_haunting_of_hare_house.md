## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** It's too much freedom.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** I'm scared and excited all at once.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** It's what I've been wanting.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Now I don't know if I was wanting the right thing.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Now you haven't.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Right.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** Yeah.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** What do I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** Have you guys not played any Pathfinder at all?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** No.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Yeah, just a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I think some of you guys have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Yeah, I have.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** Why do you ask?

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** But like the network hasn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** No.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** No.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** One or two.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I mean, either one.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Have you done one of each show?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** I was just making sure.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:26]** As soon as you were like, our first non-Starfinder system, I was like, speak for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Yeah, Heath and SCF have done everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** The first time I played Pathfinder was at SCFCon this year.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** Oh, cool.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** That was my first time too, I admit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** I played D&D before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:47]** I ran the last game of the convention with Kevin in it.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Nice.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:56]** And I was like tired after three days of like conning and having adult beverages.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:02]** And like I felt bad afterwards because I just rushed us through the end of that adventure.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Like, hurry up.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** I don't care.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Roll your damage again.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** That was garbage.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** All right, just roll again.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Hit him.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** I don't care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** It makes sense, though.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:15]** It feels like a live table setting, you know, when it's like 4 a.m.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** and you want to get through the battle and go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:25]** I mean, it was still a good time, but it very much, you could tell I was like trimming all the fat I could and just trying to get through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** I'm sure it was awesome.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** I'm sure it was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** I'm sure it was too.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** We could use some more of that spirit.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** We tend to not do the trimming of the fat.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:37]** So, I mean, it's probably good to sometimes be like, all right, shut the up.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** Next.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** You know, what are you saying?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** No, no, it's, it's, it's, it's everyone's fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** Are you saying we need more hand-wavy fudged rolls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:53]** Just, you know, if you just happen to choose a level 12 item in your thing, it's fine.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** And you're only level 6, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** I don't know.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** I keep hearing from Finder his thoughts.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:07]** So basically you're just like, how long was your game that you were GMing for them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:13]** All of those slots were like three and a half hours, I think.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:18]** And as much as I was talking about trimming fat, that is like not something I'm good at.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Like I'm naturally very long winded.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:28]** So like every one shot I've ever done was a two shot, except at STF con where it has to be a one shot.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** And then I like.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:35]** I spent too long in the beginning setting things up and wanting it to like pop and feel alive.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** And then it's like, oh, we have a boss battle to do in like 12 minutes.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** So we got to we got to get going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** That's cool.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Yeah.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Yeah.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** We'd have a great reputation of doing short shows that are supposed to be short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** He's promised that this one will be short.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Vinny was like, it's like two episodes max.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** All right.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** So we all need to promise that we're going to help him do that.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** What did you say?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Two episodes, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** This thing's going to be four or five episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** I think four or five.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** We'll see.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** I think four or five.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** I have a plan for five.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** We should ask our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** We should.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** We're taking bets.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Taking bets.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Taking a poll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** I think it's double, except when you're Kev.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** Because I thought that the Nano Adventure was going to be five eps.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** It was ten.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Kev thought it would be thirteen.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** It was like four times that.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** So that's an outlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** So we're better at calculating than Kevin.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Maybe Kevin's just terrible at estimation of effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** We'll go.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** Let's let join the discord discord.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** We'll save the podcast.com and come in.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** We'll do prices.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Right.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** I was like, are you doing the over under?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Like, is it, is it two and a half, three and a half?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** Yeah, no, this is sort of, I'm going to take that over either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:54]** And you can parlay, if you wish, what actually happened during this episode if you want to make a prop bet.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** But, you know, keep it classy.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Nothing crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Keep it classy.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** Won't save, just not condone gambling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** If you have a problem with gambling addiction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:14]** Also, if you can't join our Discord, then feel free to shoot us an email or mail us a letter or some other form of communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:18]** Smoke signal, carrier pigeon, sending stone, whatever you got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Call them on their personal phones.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** They don't mind.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Send us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Just dox us, please.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]** My personal phone number is 1-800-GAMBLER.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** 1-800-GAMBLER?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Man, how'd you lock that down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** He's a really big Willie Nelson fan.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** It's a whole thing, too, where he's an Eldridge bean and can do things like that.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** That's something you'll learn about Will, for sure.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Also, make sure you check out STF as well.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Their Discord and show and everything.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** Please do.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** Always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:53]** Speaking of shows, I think we have a little bit more work to do on these characters before we start diving in.

**[00:06:53 - 00:07:00]** So I know we wanted to talk about how they know each other, how they link to the story.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** So did we want to go ahead and iron that out before we dive in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Yeah, we should.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Yeah.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:11]** Can we just get another roll call of who is playing who, too, just so we all remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Yeah, that's a good idea.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:19]** Since I have to start to speak, I guess I'll finish it, and I'll say that I'm so agreeing.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:25]** He is a clever explorer who calls home the hounds, and we covered what those meant last time.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:31]** My favorite thing about him, Heath and I were talking about, one of the cool things about him is that he can summon beasts.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** He can have a beast companion, and it's pretty awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** So who is your beast companion?

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Like, who are we starting with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:45]** So it doesn't it just says a level two creature of your size or smaller companies you and follows your instructions.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:49]** And so your size is smaller.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Yeah, that's what it says.

**[00:07:51 - 00:08:19]** and it's like and it mentions that there's different creature types there's like avians swimmers and obviously land beasts i'm sure even though that's not really said that should be it can kind of be anything so i'm i'm open for ideas i think you can also change it because it can die but i don't know i don't want to i should be like liberties so maybe like a really fat like pot belly pig you know yeah wild boar that is super cute actually yeah

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** Some feral wild boar you tamed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** I would allow that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** That is extremely cute, and that might happen.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:28]** Yeah.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** Anyway, I really like that.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** And he also... Have you seen a wild boar?

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** I would not describe them as cute.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** Well, the pot-bellied pig was cute.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** The wild boar is a terrifying proposition.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Pot-bellied pig.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Those things are... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** The people from my own Discord will...

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:51]** set at me with their torches and pitchforks if I don't mention that it could be a possum.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** That's what I thought that you were going to leave with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** I mentioned last time that it could be and it would make sense it would be a possum in Appalachia, right?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** There's a fair amount out there.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:06]** I think possums just show up everywhere.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** They have them in a... I'm from... Or is it an opossum?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Or is that a difference?

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** They're both, apparently.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Opossum's supposedly the technical term.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** There are opossum everywhere in L.A.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** to where many of us are from.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** So, opossum... There are opossums just chilling around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** ...looks way cuter than an opossum.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** They both look cute.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** It's an underrated animal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** Truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:34]** I can't... Like, the opossums that I am familiar with in real life are, I think, were opossums.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** I don't think I've seen opossums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Sam...

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Really?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** It feels a little bit like an opossum is just a possum that put on a mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Oh, you know what?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** You're right, dude.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** A possum looks like it's from Australia or something.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** An opossum is cuter.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Damn, it looks really cute.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** They're both pronounced possum, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** I don't know.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:59]** So you may want to look at or around page 372 in the handbook.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** There's a creature called a red dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** What the fuck is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Called a what?

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** A red dog.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Coon dog.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:15]** Which is basically like it's a canine, but it's like a molten, like it thirsts for combustible fuel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** Just a giant glizzy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Just a giant glizzy.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** Wait, what?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** Yes.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** That's canon now.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** It has to be.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** Wait, a red dog animal that wants to drink fuel?

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:28]** Go on.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** I'm showing it to you.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Different from the... Oh, wow.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** That thing looks sweet.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** Oh, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Put it back.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** Put it back.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** I want to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Oh, that doesn't look good, actually.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** It looks terrifying.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** No, dude.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** That thing looks awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:41 - 00:11:06]** right but like that's the thing this is your your like magical companion and so like if you want to make it a magic creature or you know something that's not necessarily of natural that's true it's that's true sourcing you can make it whatever you want it's your character all right thank you thank you i will i that is good to know that you will allow that yep so whenever you land on it let me know uh hopefully sooner rather than later


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:11]** Side note, Red Dog is also an Australian family comedy from 2011.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:19]** Slightly based on a true story about a cattle dog who travels across Western Australia to get to its owner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Sounds good.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:28]** You know, I wasn't too sure on them, but I've recently met an Australian shepherd and he is just like the best boy.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Such a good boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** They're very, very, very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:56]** his name is oakley and he's the best anyway cool cool uh kelly now that you've taken a large sip of water uh is there anything else you wanted to flesh out about your character before we move on they're very thirsty yeah they're very thirsty so they carry around a four liter thing of aquafina wherever they go thirsty thirsty yeah he's a thirsty boy uh and that's all he is um

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:09]** He's very, very in touch with nature and something about his character is that he grew up in these here hills and is so connected to the animals and loves nature that he became a national park ranger.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:16]** And here he is back in town to do whatever weird stuff we're going to be doing in this adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Cool.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Awesome.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** I'm going to... Oh, Kelly, you punt the ball to somebody else.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Let's go with Heath.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Heath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:28]** Alright, so you've got your connection.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:38]** I was going to, full disclosure, kind of talk this out with you because I hadn't really made decisions for sure, but I'm happy to present them and then roll with funny stuff.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** So for the connection for my Nosed Unknowable, I guess let me start at the beginning.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:49]** I'm Ira Murphy playing a shifty sage who knows the unknowable.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:53]** That's the full whole A Tribe Called Quest situation.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** But for my connection, there's four options.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** I can choose one of them.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Pick one other PC.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** If it wasn't for you, they would never have made it through a difficult situation.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** That's the first one.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Pick a PC.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** You figured out they have a secret that they haven't told anyone yet.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:12]** You don't know what the secret is, but you can tell it weighs on them.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Pick a PC.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:22]** Based on comments you've overheard, you suspect this character thinks brawn and force, not reason, are the solution to most problems.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** You're suspicious that someone is a meathead.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** And then the last one is pick a PC.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:34]** When this character stands next to you, you have a hard time concentrating and you're not sure why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** That's it.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** We're going to go.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** The Rizzler's coming after you.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Is that?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Yeah.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** You are in love.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** Yeah, I mean, I think the most direct one would be, you know, I suspect one of them is a meathead.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:58]** And I think, you know, if Zoa and... Sorry, if Ira and Cole have that, like, mutual connection, I think that might make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** That's a good one.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** That works.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** I'll throw my hat in the ring for number two, which is the secret one.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** And I have darkness literally weighing on me.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** But I think the meathead one is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:28]** more appropriate what was the uh meathead consequence uh i mean it doesn't have a consequence it just says uh based on comments you've ever heard you suspect this character thinks brawn and force not reason are the solution to most problems that totally fits cole


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:33]** Who is a gracious protector who defends what matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Okay.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:42]** So I think Ira thinks Cole is a meathead, but they also are kind of friends, right?

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** They have some kind of connection from the past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** Yes.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:59]** I would say that I am a dawdling, well-to-do person, but sometimes things would escape my intellect.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:11]** That's why I interpret intellectual defense, but having low pool in intellect, because I'm too dumb to actually perceive an intellectual attack.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** impervious to mental damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:22]** I'm impervious to mental damage because I have... I drink a bit too much moonshot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** You're Captain Moonshot.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:27]** You're impervious to intellect damage like Derek Zoolander is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** The files are in the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** They're in the computer?

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:40]** I use that joke way too often for how old that movie is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** It never gets old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** Um...

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** All right.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** So also there's the initial link to the starting adventure that you can pick a list of those options.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** All right.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:56]** So the first one is you beat one of the other PCs badly in a card game, but they had a blast anyway and asked you to come along.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** I mean, I like that one because I like cards.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:06]** But two is the other PCs think they might need someone with your skills for something they're trying to do and asked you to come along.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** Three is you might have stolen from the wrong person and they might be looking for someone who's traveling alone.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:17]** So you talked the others into letting you join them for a little while.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:22]** I think that one's perfect for the Scalawag kind of character that I'm playing.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:28]** And then four is sometimes you can just smell opportunity and this bunch, they reek of it.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:32]** I feel like either of the last two fit pretty well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** Based on things that I can't quite share yet, I would go with two or four.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** But it's your character.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** You can do three and we'll make it work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** No, let's do four.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:46]** I'm just trying to take advantage of everybody.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Or profit myself.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Not necessarily hurt anybody.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** What's the text again?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** Sometimes you can just smell opportunity.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** And this bunch, they reek of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** I like that.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** I like that.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** We bring good fortune.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Smart.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Yeah.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** And that's for the clever descriptor, right?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Oh, that's, that's where are we pulling that from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Oh, shifty, not clever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Shifty.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Sorry.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:14]** Yeah.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** I was looking at the wrong character sheet.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Cool.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:23]** Well, and then there's your... Did we all need to define our character arc?

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** If you've got one, yeah.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** Okay.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:32]** So, I've been torn between two that, to me, feel very similar, and it's learn or master a skill.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:44]** And either way, it's like he's already... Ira's already pretty good at pickpocketing and dexterous type stuff, but he wants to be more magical.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** So...

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:51]** Either one of those could work, but he wants to learn to better use and harness magic.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** I love any magic-based thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** I like magic, too.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Yeah, same.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** But this is not specifically a magic-directed character.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:09]** He's much more charisma skills and dexterity, kind of thievery-based skills.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** But he is good at those things, and that's what's gotten him to where he is.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** But he really wants to be a wizard deep down in his heart.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I love that.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** A rogue sorcerer.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** That's so cool.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** I feel like learn is a little bit more general.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:27]** Like master a skill feels like you're a craftsman, you're a tradesman.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** There's like your calling.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:35]** And I feel like learn, I mean, I'm trying to find the actual arcs so I can look at what they say.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:39]** But just from a flyer review, it feels like learn is a little more general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:39 - 00:19:05]** appropriate yeah i've got master of skill oh they're right by each other yeah learn is you want to learn something this isn't the same as the uncover a secret arc in which you're looking for a bit of information this is a skill or whole area of knowledge you want to gain proficiency with this is learning how to play an instrument cook amazing dishes with ease speak a new language so on thus it's not about gaining a skill and playing an instrument but learning to be an experienced player

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:33]** so that last bit is what like i already have some ability in in using magic so he wants to master like he wants to learn to better improve his abilities with magic okay it feels like uh maybe in his mind a shortcoming of his is he's not more magically powerful i hear that cool all right well i've taken too much of your time that's iron lovely but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** I don't think Ira could ever take too much of my time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Never.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Ira arrives precisely when he needs to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** That would warm his heart.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** Just that being a line from a wizard, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Awesome.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** Who are you kicking it to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** That's me.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:12]** I am coming in as Julius Legrand, who is a mystical speaker who cannot escape the darkness, as I found myself unconsciously grabbing my mustache, like twisting it, like a villain or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** It does sound like a villain's name.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** That is very true, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:25]** So he, the Cannot Escape the Darkness, I really like it.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** It's pretty on the nose, but I think it works for him.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:34]** He is a funeral director at his family's mortuary, the Whispering Pines Mortuary.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** And for the connection to someone else,

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** There's four.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:46]** One is like, this character is also slightly affected by the darkness, so you both gain a plus one on any rolls when you collaborate.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:51]** There's also, you're certain this character appreciates your abilities and is impressed by them.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** This may or may not actually be the case.

**[00:20:53 - 00:21:01]** I don't know that Julius would think about that, but I could hear a case if someone really thought that that was appropriate.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** There's also this person...

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:10]** always seems to see you even when you're totally cloaked in darkness which is an interesting one

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:18]** And then this last one is the character once flashed a cipher in your eyes so brightly that you were blinded for several days.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** You recovered, but you keep an eye on this character just in case.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** So there's like a mischievous one, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** I mean, that sounds a little bit like Ira.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** I know.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Flashing people with ciphers.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Hoping they forget about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** Except I was blinded for several days.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Yeah, you'll get better.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Throw some dirt in it.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** You'll be fine.

**[00:21:40 - 00:22:06]** just rub some dirt in your eye it's fun i like that one i'm i'm i'm down to go with that one unless kelly we had talked previously about the darkness thing i don't know i don't know do you do you do you have a preference kelly i do not you do you do what you need for your character i could i could probably have some other way of being like a mild psycho i don't i don't need i'd like to mention earlier that's okay i like the considering that though yeah of course man

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** Uh, I do, I do like that cipher connection heat.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** So let's, let's roll with that.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Well, I like, I like that.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:17]** It's like the second time that another PC and the party has got some like shady.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** Yes.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** That Ira did in the past.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:26]** Yeah, like there's a narrative arc of who your character is just from these connections, which is cool.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:34]** Which I don't know if you want us to say, Benny, but you did give us a little bit of a background in the Discord chat.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** So I don't know if you want me to say that.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:38]** I don't want to spoil it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** No, we'll sit tight on that.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** I'll sit tight on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:54]** there was another connection through the, uh, through the mystical, uh, one, but I, I, I really wanted to get to his character arc more, uh, just to, just to bring it up to light.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:03]** You know, he, this, this cannot escape the darkness is something that he doesn't know why it's occurred.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:11]** And he, his family, like the whispering pines mortuary, I think is really successful, uh,

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:24]** And I won't go too far into it, and maybe it'll come out more in game, but they're successful due to their unorthodox approach, how they deal with passing and the dead and the bodies of those dead.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** And so they're very well regarded.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:38]** And I think that his darkness, which he's not sure where it came from, has not only affected him, but also started to affect the business and the mortuary.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:50]** And so I think his character arc is a cleanse where something has been infecting, some entity has been infecting and coming into this environment where it was not welcome.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** Could be an infestation, a curse, something else.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:59]** And so I've got to determine what that is and exterminate it, remove it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:03]** Have any of you guys ever read the short story by H.P.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Lovecraft, The Alchemist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** No, I'm about to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** I know, it feels like out of left field.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:29]** But it just, your kind of darkness-related background stuff reminded me of the plot of that story, which is like, the premise is there's a curse on this noble family's line, but every male heir, they're cursed to die when they turn 31.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** And every generation tries to break the curse.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** It's an interesting little short story.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** I'm going to read that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** That's real cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** That's real cool.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Yeah, so that's Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** Cole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** LeGrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** The name's Cole Wood.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:55]** I'm a gracious protector who defends what matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** That'll preach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Yeah.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Yeah.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:08]** I think I went over in the last one, but the background and connections were already filled and they seem to work.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:17]** I've done a whole lot of odd jobs for a whole lot of people and almost all of them regard me fondly.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:26]** My connections, I'm nearly certain all the PCs will fail me without my help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** will fail without you.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** I'm convinced they will all fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:34]** I'm convinced they're all going to fail.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:39]** So I just insert myself like a useful idiot would.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:44]** I pick one other PC which we already established in the last episode.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Ira.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** This character claims innocence during a long ago event and I protected him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:57]** It was from popping that cipher in Julius' eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:03]** Now that that time has passed, I'm not entirely convinced he was blameless.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Oh, man.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** I'm so excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Well, the timing on that is perfect.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:12]** You become unconvinced that he's blameless as soon as Julius joins the party.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:17]** He's like, that motherfucker right there popped firecrackers in my eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:24]** And for my character arc, I'm going to try to right a wrong or bring a wrongdoer to justice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Is the wrongdoer me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:35]** Well, before he whoops Ira's ass and gets an XP for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:40]** As soon as the adventure begins, just comes in Rex, Iroh.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Put you in the stocks, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** Just gains a level, arc complete, all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** I have to bring in a new character immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:57]** Well, I was thinking it might work because I think last time we like, oh, maybe like you poisoned like a well.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:02]** And maybe I know it was your poison, but maybe it wasn't you who poisoned the well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Who poisoned the water hole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** There's a snake in my boot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:34]** what is it girl cool i'm stoked this is all really great thank you guys for playing these characters are we ready to dive in thanks for running this fantastic game benny my good my good let's get it dismal pennsylvania 1901

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:43]** Nestled in the rugged mountains of Pennsylvania, the small coal mining pound of Dismal lived up to its name in the early 1900s.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:54]** Enshrouded by dense foreboding forests, the town was a somber hub of relentless toil, with narrow, winding streets lined with weathered, creaking wooden houses.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** The air was perpetually thick with coal dust and the mournful echoes of the mines.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:10]** Dismal's community, though close-knit, was marked by hardship and sorrow, with families gathering at the local church to seek solace from their daily struggles.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Children played in the shadow of those towering pines.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** Their laughter a rare sound amidst the constant grind.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:27]** Despite the bleak working conditions, the town's residents clung to the stark beauty of their natural surroundings and the fleeting moments of camaraderie that offered a brief respite from their grim reality.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:36]** The scene opens on the four of you at 12 years old getting tucked into bed.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Oh my god.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:51]** parental unit, uh, sitting there, you know, you've, you've put your pajamas on and you've brushed your teeth and you're in bed and you're getting ready to go to sleep and they read you a, uh, a bit of a nursery rhyme from a book called, uh, the tales of rabbit rabbit.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:59]** In a meadow bright and green where the daisies loved to sway lived a rabbit quick and keen who'd hop around all day.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:06]** Rabbit Rabbit was his name, a critter full of cheer, but Foxy Loxy fierce and game would often bring him fear.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** One sunny day the chase began beneath that southern sky.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** Rabbit Rabbit hatched a plan, a clever crafty guy.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:18]** He'd lure Foxy to the stream where the waters flowed so slick and slippery rocks would foil his schemes.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** That'd do the trick.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:24]** With a twitchy nose and cheeky grin, Rabbit Rabbit set his snare.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** He bounded off with nimble spin through the warm southern air.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:35]** Foxy followed Isaac Leem with hunger in his stride, but soon he reached the rushing stream where dangers did reside.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:58]** foxy with his sharp keen eyes and teeth that gleamed so bright slipped and tumbled with surprise into the water's might water splattered all around as he let out a growl rabbit laughed with glee and said you've fallen for my prowl better luck next time my boy you've fallen for my line foxy wet and mad knew the game would start anew but rabbit rabbit quick and glad already had a clue

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:06]** For in the meadow bright and green where adventures never cease, the chase would always be seen a dance of wits and peace.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** You all go to sleep.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:17]** You wake up the next morning and it's a nice, bright, warm summer's day.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** And so off you head to your 12.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Yes.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** At 12 off you head into the woods and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** No, we're 12 years old?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** 12 years old.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Okay.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Your children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** And this is, what year is this?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** 1901.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** 1901.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Okay.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Are we like brothers?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** So are we friends?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:45]** You're all friends in this, uh, just piddling around, piddling around.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:53]** Uh, you make your way to, um, your, one of your more famous, um, places that you've spent a lot of your time.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** It's this fort in the woods.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:03]** Um, you've each decorated it with trinkets and things you've found around, maybe bones, maybe interesting sticks.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** And, um,

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:31]** we've it's centered on this rabbit shaped statue the sensation you get in this clearing is a one of anonymity where each time you've ventured around into the woods before you felt like there were always prying eyes and you know someone maybe just around the corner but here you get a sense of peace

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:39]** And so what is it that you think each of your characters might have decorated this fort with?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Created it with?

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Yeah.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Like what trinket would your character have brought?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Trinket, huh?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** My mom gave me this little rabbit.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** All right.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Full disclosure to everyone.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:54]** I don't know how to do any accents from this region.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** So I'm going to try seven.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** And then if one of them lands, then that's what I'm going to go with.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** If not, I'm just going to return to like a normal voice.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** I'm not going to try to do it as a 12-year-old.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:10]** And basically, Zoa likes animals a lot, and he has some wild pets.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** So he took some rabbit fur.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** Speaking of rabbits, as they shed.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** I guess rabbits maybe shed.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** I have no idea.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** And then put it in between the logs of the fort to insulate it.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** That's what he did.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Lots of thoughtful hands-on mouths.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** This is a stumper, I imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** It's like, I don't know this character well enough.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** My immediate thought was, something I stole.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:42]** Whatever it is, young Ira stole it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:47]** There's a little chest of just matchbooks and lighters that he's stolen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Just like little knickknacks he's been stealing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** I love that.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Julius or Cole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:53 - 00:33:01]** I think Julius... Julius is already wearing, like, a three-piece suit at this time, even at 12.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Oh, wow!

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** He's got a handkerchief or something monogrammed.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:13]** Yeah, like, he walks with it, but the jacket is there, and so he just undoes the vest, right?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** But it's big on him, because it's his older brother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** He's got the gold, like, pocket timekeeper he pulls out, dignified, like, every now and then.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** He...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** His family isn't that well-to-do.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** He's got a monocle with no lens in it.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Oh, yeah, just a total hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:33]** He's got two separate monocles on each eye, using them as a set of glasses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** That's just what his family wears.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** That's what they need to be in.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:55]** I think what he would have done is he would have brought a real rabbit's foot that he had taken and cut open a bit.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:24]** and then sewed back together and there's all this like there's all this stuff on it that like there's these little markings and stuff that he is trying to that he's taken from his parents books and things on how to bury the dead and so he's prepared this foot to move on and so he has that foot hanging on like a tattered piece of rope with several knots in it and the knots indicate you know a certain length of time that the

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:30]** that since the rabbit has been dead and, and the intention for where the rabbit should go once it's passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:35]** I think Cole and creepy checks out.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Yeah.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:53]** I think Cole growing up in them Hills and hollers with his, uh, uncle, maybe he, uh, maybe he's shines and, uh, going out, you know, if you know something about moonshine and water is an important thing and, uh,

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:03]** Maybe, you know, helping him set up some irrigation, some cooling, a water source out in those hills.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** He stumbled upon a...

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:27]** really smooth rock like a riverbed rock that's just right smooth for for holding for for setting down maybe maybe one day throwing it in a sling who knows but wouldn't want to lose it it's a nice piece of like it's a good skipping rock

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:30]** Yeah, it would be a good skipping rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** The temptation to skip it would be so high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** But when it's too good, you don't.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** You judge every other stone by that stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** All right, sticky fingers over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:44]** I think it would actually probably be like a Jasper rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Hey, that's a nice rock.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Let me see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Ain't fooling around with you.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** This is my rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:57]** Grab this trinket of 12 different stolen things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** You have the most trinkets of all of us.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** They're all worthless, though.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:07]** He's just stealing to get better at stealing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** I obviously up because insulating a Ford is not at all what we're like kind of going for.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** So that was like a answer of mine.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** So I'm going to change it.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Okay.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:24]** It's going to be like some like little stuffed pig, you know, because one day he really wants to meet a pot belly pig.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** He never got to, he got to meet all kinds of cute little animals, but not that.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** So he just kind of has it as a necklace around his, his neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:59]** it's so it it makes so much sense that that like you might not have met one because while there are farms like those are very protected animals that's like that's that's the life of the farmer and the so it's like yeah of course it's the most coveted animal in these parts yeah like for sure they hide them like in like a barn inside of a barn like way back you know what i mean like where no kids like me at 12 can see them i don't even know if they're real like i just hope that they are you know what i mean the legends are true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** It's like birds.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Birds aren't real.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Birds aren't real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:11]** I've seen a pig before, but it smelled real bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:15]** John, every character that you make is like a f***ing child villain.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** I swear to God.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** Every single one of them.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** You just got that kind of energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:26]** I'm keeping all of my animals away from you.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** It smelled real bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:57]** ooh okay toward the end of that summer as you were all spending time together in the fort something happens it's like a bomb went off in the middle of the fort but a bomb made of shadow and the night the sounds like flashbangs going off the smell of sulfur and burn each of you feel it sweep over you like sharp edged feathers and you can feel yourself forever changed

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:03]** For a moment, your world and your vision darkens, and you find yourself somewhere or someone else, and then you come back.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:15]** And when you do, you see that the rapid-shaped stone that had marked the very center of the fort has shattered into nothing but ash and smoke.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** And then you see something else.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Julius on the ground.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Still.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Still.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Silent.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** Each of you has seen death before.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** In the smallest things, in the larger things, in the bee, in the robin, in the rabbit.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:35]** And so you know death when you see it resting inside your friend.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** A moment later, a cottontail appears next to your friend.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** But it is no ordinary rabbit.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** It is Rabbit Rabbit.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** A creature long told in your bedtime stories and your campfire horrors.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:58]** There is a living rabbit as rabbit rabbit's heart, small, big-footed, and big-eared, but upon and around that brown beating heart are layered a thousand ghosts of rabbits that were.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:05]** Torn and tattered, teeth grown too long and nails sharpened to talons, each rabbit ghost tells their own story of luck gone wrong.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:16]** Together they form the shape of a cottontail, too large to be believed, one ear torn and dripping, blood of the many upon its muzzle, back feet poised to drum even the dead to wake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:41]** rabbit rabbit speaks and his voice is dying grass of fall whispering in the chill this nest is my doing and although i should not have let you borrow it for i knew it to be dangerous i did it gladdened my heart and i allowed it to continue for far too long i can return your friend to the life from which they came to be full and true and beating apart once again however

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:51]** should all have an oath to be paid together as a single warrant upon your friend's next and final death.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Do you say yes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Oh, no, Julius.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** Are we still 12 years old?

**[00:39:59 - 00:39:59]** Yes.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Or is this in the future?

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Oh, no, Julius.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** You were doing great.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** Boy, I don't know.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** He was so creepy and scary.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** It makes sense that death would take him so early.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:21]** He just like cleans off one of his four monocles for some reason and like leans down to his body.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** I will take the oath.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** Or owe you or whatever you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Do we all have to take it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** I think we all do, or he's not going to make it.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** It's got to be all or nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:44]** This is cattywampus.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** This is actually, that's a terrible use of that word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Just throwing it in wherever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** We'll just shoot for one of the euphemisms.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** All right, we'll get there.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** Dag gum, I suppose I'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:10]** Ira is the, is definitely the holdout, like not wanting to make that as, but like the peer pressure is 12, you know, of the rest of the group doing it.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:15]** And then I imagine like the other two just like turn and look at him expectantly.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** And it's like, all right, fine.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:24]** Everybody hold hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Right.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** And do the change.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** As, as Ira agrees.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:32]** Julius breathes, as though they had never stopped.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** Rabbit Rabbit bows his many heads and is gone.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** The fort you once loved is destroyed.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:47]** You are not sure what you've said yes to, and already the entirety of it begins to fade, a dream of friendship and death already unraveling.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** After that, you all drift apart.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** Even if you stay in the same town, you go your own ways.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** It is like with the loss of the fort and the loss of Julius.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** There's nothing holding you together anymore.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** You're forever changed, each of you, in some way that you've only begun to explore.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:08]** You do not truly come together again until one summer, years later.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:21]** When you get the message that your childhood friend Julius has died and you understand that you must return to the woods, that you must gather at the fort, that there's something you must do.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** And that is our game.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** That's where we're ending?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** This is crazy.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** This is crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:59]** i was good knowing your character john i'm sorry that you don't get twice you want to be like a ghost or something i died twice and i built this whole character and i died twice wait you weren't in on this john like you know john didn't even once no no i thought that when he's like yeah and then breath came back to his body like he's been reading the whole time i was like cool my character's back like let's go and then now i'm questioning everything because now i'm dead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Well, you can't question me.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** You're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Yeah, no, I can't talk.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** Okay.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** All right.
