**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Won't Save is an actual play podcast of the horror RPG Old Gods of Appalachia and contains content that may be disturbing to some listeners.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollows and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale has yet to be told.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:35]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:45]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper on the wind.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:50]** Hanks and boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the picking.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:05]** Welcome to Waltz Save, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]** Of all the plugs for our coffee, that was one of them.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** That was one of the plugs of all time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:38]** Could we sell We'll Save Milk on there?

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Our own milk that we produce.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Yours truly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:49]** If you're turned off by all this milk talk, you can also come to the SDF Network's Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** And also join the Discord, too.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** You can do both.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** You should definitely check out the SDF Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:00]** We have currently zero milk-themed campaigns that I'm aware of.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** That's important for you.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Thus far.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** We do a lot of content, though, so it's probably coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** For our lactose intolerant listeners, there's STF.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** That's the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:21]** Now that I'm thinking about it, there's not a new themed one, but there's definitely been STF and French shows where people played...

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** whatever the Starfinder version of Minotaurs are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** That's cool.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Goldhorn.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** Another race I have to freaking discover.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** It's Captain Goldhorn.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** What is he again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** He's like a Gnar.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** It's Newar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Gnar.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Gnar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** It's just an Australian person saying that.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** It's like a gnar in Melbourne.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** They're the pot-bellied pigs of the Starfinder universe.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Oh, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** When am I going to find one of those, by the way?

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** I am waiting for the three-fold tie-in.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** Maybe that's it, Benny.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** You did take notes in the episode that just recently came out.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** You did take some note about something.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:04]** I did.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Will I reveal that note?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** You know what?

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** It would be fair if you just gaslighted me like I gaslight you.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** This is related to the 3FC thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** I don't know.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:20]** I like to get things related, but that's one thing that would be too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** I can't handle it.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** I think so.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** I can't handle it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** It's a stretch.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** I mean, I'll say that much.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:30]** It's a huge stretch to try to link this to the Starfinder universe.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Yes.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** But is it a stretch too far?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Well, time will tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** Starfinder does exist in the same universe, technically.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** It is possible.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** As Pathfinder, yes.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Earth.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Which is Earth.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Earth is in it, I should say.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Somewhere.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Some other solar system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:52]** Yeah, in the Pathfinder slash Starfinder universe, there are in writing...

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:56]** are in adventure references to Earth.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** There's one adventure that I know of that does it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Can you share?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:04]** Well, I didn't want to, in case anybody does.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** That's kind of a big spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Let's not do it.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Never mind.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:17]** So, milk save the 5D cast.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** This 5D right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** The cow cast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Yeah, the cow cast.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Question of the week.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** You're walking out on stage.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** The lights are bright.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:34]** The audience is cheering, chanting your name at the top of their lungs.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** And your walkout music is playing.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** What song is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:49]** I don't know why, but I didn't know what you were going to ask, but for the first thing, the first thing that came into my head was that you're walking out, folks are cheering your name, and then you realize that your fly is undone.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** And you're like, ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Went a different way.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah, right?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** It's a different type of cheering.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** Nobody speak, but I run the jewels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Run the jewels.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** R-T-J.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** R-T-J.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** R-T-J.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** How does that go?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** How does one choose a song for something like this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Nobody speak.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Nobody get choked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** Is it supposed to be your personality?

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** At least one of y'all is a real one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** I know that, James.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** At least one of y'all is a real one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** DJ Shadow.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** Swap me and Will on a different level.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:44]** i was also thinking of an rtj song maybe yeah yeah okay oh this time is just so hype dude like they're built to be great walkout music actually and sorry to plug my own podcast again but we have a patreon uh

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:59]** subscriber to your reward that is called fight rock where you get to uh i and or me and adam invented a boxing themed uh mini game i say mini game it takes like two or three hours to do one

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:07]** Um, but you can come and box against me, uh, as a, uh, and, and a character that I played, which I don't want to spoil if you don't know our show.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:16]** Uh, but every time we do it, that's part of the appeal is like the person that I'm boxing against gets to create their own character with our, our subsystem.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:23]** And then we do the, like, you know, WWE style, like entrances and like what, you know, what song you plan.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** So I've had to answer this question a lot of times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** No way.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:27]** Yep.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** I also, like, I'm just thinking of the ones I, like, default to.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** Coach Ice by Audioslave is a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Putting these on the list.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Yeah.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** This song is a banger.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** I don't know why I've never heard it before, but I'm immediately adding it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** Are you not familiar with Run the Jewels?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** I'm not familiar with Run the Jewels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Okay.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Oh, my God.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** I'm so disappointed.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Okay, so look.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** You got homework.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** That's all that means.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** This is an opportunity.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** It's going to be the most enjoyable homework ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** You're going to listen for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:30]** it is I think mine to fill some time while people choose Dave Matthews no I'm gonna go Feeling Good by Michael Buble the Michael Buble version that big horn drop after you said you don't know RTJ that tracks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** You've seen that song, Bran, for like... Oh no, I already died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** I don't know how this... Sorry.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** He's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** I'm just going to hang out and listen to you guys play.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** I got to turn into a bear, so really all my wishes were fulfilled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** That's true.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** You are successful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:54]** That's literally why I picked Iris, because I could turn into a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** You can die in peace.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:00]** What is the context of this stage present?

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** What did I just do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** I mean, that is a fair question.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** Are we coming out as WWE wrestlers?

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:09]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:15]** Am I about to slap somebody or is it like a lecture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:21]** You are a professor at a community college.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** You're entering the classroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:28]** You're walking into the Department of Motor Vehicles to pay a fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:34]** I wish RTJ blasted every time I went to the DMV.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** That'd be amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** Maybe they would wake up from behind the counter.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:46]** Even if they didn't, it would just really channel the aggression that I feel every time I have to go to the DMV.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Absolutely.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** Nobody speak, nobody get you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:56]** Dude, I had to pay a ticket the other day, because it's 2024, right?

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** And so I got a link.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** I got a letter in the mail saying, hey, you ran a red light.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Here's our proof.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Here's the QR code.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:10]** And you scan the QR code, and you plug in the password from the letter.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:15]** And it's like, in 4K, light turns red, me in my car, just like...

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** It's like, okay, yeah, you got me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** There is zero doubt.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Undisputable video evidence.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** That was definitely not a catch.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** And so here's your $280.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:34]** I mean, that's why Jacksonville can afford 4K traffic cameras is because they charge $280 for the tickets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** Because they're schmucks like me going through red lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, that's why, man.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:45]** Well, but are they one of those towns that their police, they're just a business of getting tickets?

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** They just shoot for that all the time?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Yeah.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:52]** So I know like Gulf Shores, Alabama is really bad like that.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:57]** It's kind of a party destination, but it's like the cops are there just waiting to make some money off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** Yeah.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Gulf Shores, Dolphin Island to a certain extent.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Yeah.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Yeah.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:41]** Is it like a UFC fight or is it like a duel?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** It's Muay Thai.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Yeah.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Muay Thai?

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** This is an exhibition match in a retirement home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Okay.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** That's the thing.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Yeah, run the jewels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** It's perfect for that.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:56]** I'm going to go with... This is like a gamer favorite.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** By the Sword by IamJKill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** What's it called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** By the Sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** By the Sword by IamJKill.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** We are all going to look at it.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** And unfortunately, we legally can't play more than five seconds of it.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** So I probably can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** Oh, it's IamJKill.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:21]** I thought you said I-N-J, the letters, kill, the word.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** This didn't come up at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** I mean, RTJ was taken.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** So it was that or like Denzel Curry or like.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I'm waiting for the drop.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** We are all waiting for the drop.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** The people who are listening and watching are waiting for the drop.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** That's good.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** One hundred percent.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Yeah.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Solid choice.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Solid.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** I never knew who it was.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** I am a Jkill.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** That's who it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** All one word, no spaces.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** All one word, no spaces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** Yep.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:04]** I would choose... I'm... This is a little, like... I don't know, what's the term?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Like, recent?

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** And I just feel like...

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:30]** a lot of these songs like come in and go out and then i remember them later on but there's one recently that i've really dug and every time i hear it i'm just like going hard in my head and it's uh it's called big dogs by hanuman kind yeah i've just started listening to that yeah i mean that was on my list to choose as well but as per usual yeah like something before i do so thanks john

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** For a second, I thought you were going to go with Big Dog S*** by Lil Mabu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Me too.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** I thought I was too.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** I don't know who that is, but I should check him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Yeah, I just dropped the link in our chat.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:17]** It's like the chorus is like this really deep, like almost exhibit voice.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** He's like, I'm a big dog.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** And then like the second half of the chorus is this like eight year old.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** I'm a big dog.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** I do big dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Oh, my God.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** I love that.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** You know, whatever happened to big dog's clothing, you remember that?

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** Like, when, like, everyone had big dog's shirts.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** It is apparent.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** I just looked it up.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** But, like, no one wears that shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** I mean, I shopped it because they had my size on racks.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** Like, it was, like, plus size kids clothes.

**[00:15:47 - 00:16:05]** yeah i mean they make every every size imaginable it's cute i mean all the puns were good i don't know yeah they were like they were like an early vineyard vine sort of flavor yeah maybe yeah yeah i don't know what that is but i'm not gonna say yeah um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** All right, cool.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** I don't know what I'm going to choose.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** I'm not good at this kind of thing.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** So I'm just going to choose, like, the opening to Attack on Titan or whatever.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** Gurren No Yumiya, season one.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** There you go.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** That's what it is.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** Weeb.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** Attack on Titan opening, but it's Gurren No Yumiya.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Gurren No Yumiya.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yes, that's actually how you say it.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** Can you send that in the channel?

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Could that be dope?

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** It's just an epic thing.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** It's very epic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Yeah.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** I mean, you know, I had to choose something, and I feel like if you're showing up to a battle, it sounds about right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Right.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** It's got that, like, Super Smash Brothers vibe.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** It has, like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:49 - 00:17:13]** i would also as a second choice possibly choose paint the town red by doja cat but only certain parts of it that's good don't you cat exactly i kind of like what i said yeah that's good all right time to check out this cool thanks for everyone listening to us listen to other songs that was a fun time for us that we can't maybe not as much for you you know what song we can't legally do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** You know what song I think would be an excellent walkout song?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:28]** I don't know if I've seen anyone ever do it in boxing or UFC or anything, but when the song starts, it just feels like, oh, I could see somebody walking out the tunnel.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:36]** You wouldn't think it based on the lyrical content, but Miss Jackson by OutKast would be a phenomenal walkout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Yeah, that's a very good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** Because it starts with that... You know that weird...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:42 - 00:18:02]** airy kind of um disc scratch slow that's a good sleeper one i may actually that is a good one let us know what your sleeper uh or what what your walkout song would be yeah uh also just to throw one more out there because i love this song it's a banger


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Bubbling by Anderson .Paak.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** I haven't heard of it.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** Are any of y'all familiar with Anderson .Paak?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** Yeah, but I don't know that tune.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** It's his most hardcore rap song.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I'm listening to it.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Make fun of me.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** I didn't really mess with Anderson .Paak until Subsonic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** I believe that, based on all the things you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Oh, that hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** I'm kidding.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** I'm not on Soap Sonic.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Soap Sonic is beautiful music.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** It really is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:34]** That was the best I'm not mad but disappointed I think I've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** I'm a huge Anderson .Paak fan.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's the only reason.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** At all disappointed.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** I like Soak Sonic, though.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** It's really good.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:46]** It's a great throwback to that Barry White style of 70s soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:47 - 00:19:00]** Well, the thing is that they'll do that, and then they'll also do... Bruno Mars will do a little 80s and 90s, and it won't be officially Soak Sonic, but you know that Anderson .Paak was probably involved in the production.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Right.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** Right.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** And like, I want them to release another album.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:20]** And they also just do stuff live that are like, they do stuff on the record that is also stuff that you would do live in terms of like the arrangement, the vibe, like, which just, it translates immediately to being a hit because you can play it in any venue and it just is a banger.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** And they're really good musicians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:29]** That's like a really great sort of super group, you know, like that term gets thrown around a lot, but you know,

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:36]** You think about it, and it's like, okay, there's been lots of supergroups throughout the years of music history.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:42]** How many of them were like, no, this is on par with any of the artists in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Speaking of supergroups... We're here, baby.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Let's get back to you four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:50]** Are we super?

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Is that what we are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** Not with that attitude, I guess.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** If you have to ask, Kelly.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** If you have to ask...

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** You'll never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Previously.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Okay.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Let's play.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** On the Old Gods.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:20]** Zoa recognizes this woman bound in the center of the clearing at the end of this tunnel as Miss Mary Jo, the watermander.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** And a whole lot of exposition happens.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:33]** You figure out that she is just as much the Miss Mary Jo that travels through the town and grabs her supplies.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:44]** And as much as she is sort of a really powerful, magical entity, similar to Rabbit Rabbit, called the Watermander.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:50]** She's bound in these sheets of strange leather sheets.

**[00:20:50 - 00:21:00]** Kjarn came in and to her home, kidnapped her, bound her in this cave, and basically left her here.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** For what purpose?

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** We don't yet know.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:13]** We found out this creature is big, putting the pieces together based on the big gap in her front door.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** You know, she's very clearly shaking.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Is that a euphemism?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:22]** Uh, yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Oops.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** Based on the literal gaps in her literal front door.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:36]** Um, she has knows the ritual, but can't perform it because she's all tied up and asks for your help.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** You help her.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** You break these binds just as you finish breaking those binds of voice.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Um,

**[00:21:45 - 00:22:10]** sounds from behind you to remind to to to intimate to you all i see we are not alone tell me i gotta roll for initiative it's another bear i want to see two bears battle it out do we see anything do we do we bear fight uh as you turn around

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** I'm going to copy this link and put it in the chat.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** You see this character.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:25]** He's a rather large... Is that a euphemism?

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** Jesus Christ.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:35]** I've already passed up a couple opportunities for euphemisms right after he cracked you with it.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** She's all tied up and asking for help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** Stop what you're doing and look at this image.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** This is not an image that I really want to look at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** It's loading.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Yeah.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** What's going to happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Oh, shit.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Kjarn.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** I see a name.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** I don't even see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Yeah, well, I don't want to look at the image.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** Like, I want to click away, but I'm also a little entranced.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:00]** Oh.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** It looks like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:06]** It's a yellow-caped, robed, sheeted figure.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:11]** with like, like almost like a, like, yeah, like a, I don't know.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** How would you describe that?

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Yellow?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** It's like an ochre.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** Yeah.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:23]** Like all the, all the bad goo and pestilence.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** It looks like the world, but it's not like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** Obviously it's just like yellow colored.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** Looks like something out of Elden Ring.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Cloth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** It does have some big Elden Ring vibes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:44]** Yeah, there are wings, but then you can't see its face, but just literally a smile that is like three razor sharp teeth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:44 - 00:24:00]** Not to be super on-brand for me or whatever, but in Japan, there's this crazy-ass monster that's an ancient kind of thing that's been around for a long time, but it has ear-to-ear smile with sharp teeth, and it looks like that if you've ever seen that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** That's pretty on-brand for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:10]** You can't see its eyes, but it's a large figure, and...

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:33]** disproportionately large arms yep yep that are closed so you can only see like the wrist but it's way further down than you would expect a normal human wrist to lie uh it's like yeah like seven foot long arm tiny little hand tiny hands grasping what appears to be a whip


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** A flaming cat of nine tails is what it looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** With a giant pokey bit on the end.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:46]** Yeah, like, could club you if you got in too close with this, like, ripped off of a tree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Like, it's made out of, like, thorn.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:53]** Like, you know those, like, thorn canes that people have in, like, Ireland and whatnot?

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** There's, like... Also...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** Where the whips come out, it looks like there's teeth around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Yeah, you're right.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:05]** This is a genuinely terrifying thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** A lot of teeth stuff going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** This is not making me feel comfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Its hand is like beckoning to come towards it as well.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** I didn't even notice the other hand.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** My God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** But it's like a little baby hand too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:48]** doing the like come hither you know yeah yeah but it could also be holding a sippy cup how are you doing little baby in other words it also kind of looks like uh candy corn if candy corn transmogrified into a human being i feel like it would into a villain in your candy corn one shot yeah if the candy corn were old skin yeah it's like candy corn's been left out in the sun for like a couple years and then it just like comes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:48 - 00:26:08]** is it people scan was i right yeah is it people okay is it clothed in people leather it's people leather yeah it's not it's not cloaked in cow leather i'll give you that all right so it says we're not the only ones here what did it say he says we are i see we're not alone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** We?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:21]** I mean, because he can look around the room and see there's four people plus the Mander, which he previously bound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Oh, so he did bind her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Presumably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** This is Kjarn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:29]** What brings you four to this mine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** Oh, I was just running away.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:34]** Yeah.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** We'll see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:41]** He slides in front of you and says, I don't believe I can allow that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Are you waiting on me to not be a bear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Kian, what do you want with Linda?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** I don't rightly know.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:06]** My employer would like her alive, but out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:13]** Well, we also would like that, so we can just take her away right now, and she'll be out of the way and alive.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** And all of us will be alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** She will remain alive here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:23]** What's your employer got to do with the watermander?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:29]** my employer would like to build a dam.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** What do we know?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** The watermender stands in the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** Can I do an intro to see what we know about Kjarn?

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:46]** Have we seen such a hulking, disgusting, sinister creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** I'm not going to make you roll for it.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:54]** You've never seen, heard of, like, brand new information for you.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:00]** Yeah, I feel like if we did, it would be an interesting life if we ran into things like this on the regular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:14]** I reckon perhaps, maybe you're not informed, but that dam's going to cause a whole lot of damage to this area and the people here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:24]** I've heard such rumors and believe them to be false.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** Well, she promises she won't get in the way.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** So we're just going to take her now.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** And it was really nice to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** And you could just brush past the side of it.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** She will not leave.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** And he stands firm in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** So does that mean that we can leave?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Just not with her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Should you choose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Yeah, let's just abandon the mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:52]** You could help me right this wrong.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** And assist me in rebinding her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** Well, now that is something that's false.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** Well, suppose we were to.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** How would that go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Well...

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:16]** My employer has resources more fast than you can imagine.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:22]** What do I have to offer you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:25]** No, I just meant, like, how would we rebound her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:35]** I mean, it's a valid question, but no one... You saw her bound, I presume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** They are magical restraints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, they disappeared right before I asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:47]** So I would replace them from whence they came.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** You're asking bullshit questions.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:55]** Okay, can I metagame for a second?

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:03]** I was just trying to get him into a vulnerable state in which we could attack him better, but hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:33]** i wrote for to be the one that's generally kind of cowardly and uh shysty like is he kind of is kind of stunned initially no no actually no that's my point is he like looks he knows the watermander and like respects her a lot and kind of turns to you guys and he's like stunned to silence for a little bit and then when he's you know the guy's like we're gonna if y'all bind her again ira very quietly like kind of whisper into you guys just like we can't

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** We can't help him do that.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** He's my friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** Yeah, Julius looks and nods at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** I don't know if I fear it.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** I mean, I wouldn't vocalize this.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:54]** I'm assuming Cole's face-to-face, so he's not going to try and give away what he's thinking.

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:00]** But, you know, this guy versus Rabbit Rabbit or, you know, us, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** That's true.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** If we don't do this, Rabbit Rabbit is going to kick our ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** If we don't do this, we're screwed with Rabbit Rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:05]** Yeah.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yeah.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Plus, who knows what will happen to Julius after that?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** And then the watermander will be gone.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** You know, it's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** I think this is about to be a Donnybrook.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** All right.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** All right.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Become a bear again.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** Everyone form a phalanx position around us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Let's see what more information we can get.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Who is your employer?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Keon.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Keon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:32]** I've never... You speak to the company or a person at the company?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Who's this rich fella?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Companies do not speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** That's why I clarify.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:45]** I assume your employer can provide a bill of sale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** What's the offer?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:49]** And I will make this offer once.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:54]** Join us in our efforts.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:01]** There's room for intrepid individuals as yourselves.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:11]** In exchange, we offer power beyond your wildest imaginings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** Does this power include the ability to defend what matters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:26]** In whatever manner the lengthy colon navigation company sees fit.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** The Mander will be leaving with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** And this Mander will help see to it.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** And Salamander.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** I didn't mean to interrupt you there, Julius.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** I just wanted to make an appearance.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** If you fight us, you're going to have to go through Clemmie.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** As the Salamander comes out, you see a little glimmer in the Watermander's eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** I don't like the way you're looking at my... I don't like the way you're looking at Clemmie.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** as you wish.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Oh my god.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Okay, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Alright, alright, alright.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** Alright, eight.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Seventeen.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Also seventeen.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Ooh, this is creepy sounding.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** This sounds like Elder Ring too.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Alright, I'm ready for an Elder Ring battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** Yo, this is definitely an Elder Ring battle and I'm terrified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** We just need chanting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** Eight and seventeen so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Yeah.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** And a seven.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** And I'm trained in initiative.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** And you got the 17?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Whatever S is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Yeah, specialized.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** What'd you get, Cole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** Oh, it says trained, but then it has an S next.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Oh, it's speed.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** That's the pool.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Correct.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** I'm trained.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** He got a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Cool.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Julius?

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** 17 as well.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** And let me grab this.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Train all interactions.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Awesome.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** So, Kjarn.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Of course, Kjarn goes first.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Actually, Cold Ward goes first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** Cole Ward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** Quick as a whip goes first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** The whip goes first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** No, quick as a whip, Cole Ward goes first.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Quick as a whip.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** The whip is a person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Holy sh**.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Steve?

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:45]** steve the whip steve i haven't seen you in a coon's age all right being a bit uh i don't know i don't want to say frightened although fear is part of it for sure uh cole is going to reach into his pocket

**[00:34:46 - 00:35:00]** He's gonna start shaking this, like, little bag that contains false daisy, a devil's shoestring, ginseng root, and a piece of brown paper with all my enemies written on it.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Oh.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:06]** And he's going to speak into the bags, like, just sort of low.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:13]** I think he got it, like, from one of those, you know, itinerant, you know, charismatic preachers.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:18]** One of those, you know, like, sayers or something that...

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:45]** wander the wilderness and go to towns promising you know whatever and he says to the bag the devil can't dance when he's kneeling nice and for the next 10 minutes my attacks inflict plus two points of damage i don't know what the level what is the 1d6 level thing that i have to roll for the cipher um the which cipher


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:53]** the all my enemies um it is it's a level six cypher oh we rolled those before we started

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:18]** yeah okay cool cool um and he's gonna go go at him with the machete cool nice so um that would be a great thing for you to do next turn what um activating that cipher would have oh got it got it got it got it got it got it got it um so you can move yourself if you would like

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Well, maybe I'll hit him with a shotgun.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** I'm missing a page, and it's kind of important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** Oh, no.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** What's the page?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** He lost the boss fight page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Yeah, I'm good.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** I'm good.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** I'll figure it out.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** So you want to hit him with the shotgun instead of using the cipher?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** No, I'm going to use the cipher for the next 10 minutes.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Okay, so you're going to use the cipher.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** How long is it for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** Yeah, next 10 minutes.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** Yeah, so you can use the cipher.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** Okay, so you have used the cipher as your action.

**[00:36:48 - 00:37:09]** yeah 12 nice nice oh yep cool no it's right here it was just on the back of another page which is annoying but whatever um cool would you like to relocate yourself or are you going to stay in immediate range of everybody i don't know that you really can relocate yourself because he's blocking the entrance


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:16]** Uh, I imagine that before he did this, he kind of turned around and went back a little bit.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Cool.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:28]** Just like, well, you know, kind of like to feign like, um, I don't know if it necessarily feigned, but I think he would draw back, try to get out of range of this dude's whip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:34]** Yeah, there's, I mean, because range in this game is handled so fast and loose, like, we're all in melee range of everybody.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:39]** Like, this clearing isn't big enough to... For the both of us.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** To not just, like, fist fight with everybody.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** So, cool.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Cole Ward, that's your turn.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:50]** Next up, the newly freed Watermander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Ooh!

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Watermander!

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Manda?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** And she will... I'm in the mood for some water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** There it is.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Appreciate you, Huel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** I like it.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** I like it.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:11]** She... You hear her whispering in what sounds like Parseltongue.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Nice.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:40]** and so what happens is um zoa i think starts dancing because you see a maelstrom of um salamanders yes running down the mine oh my god climbing onto her body and like interlocking as armor on her person


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:43]** Salamander mech?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Wait, why don't I get this?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Salamander mech?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Yeah.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Salamander mech.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** Salamander mech.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Salamander mech.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Salamander mech.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Basically.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Salamander mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Salamander mech.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Salamander mech.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Salamander mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Salamander mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Salamander mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Yeah.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Oh, it's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Well, that's the best thing I've ever seen.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Is the ability.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Yeah, that's dope.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** That's dope.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** So she's done.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Kjarn takes a step.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** Did they all roll higher than 17th?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:36]** yarn that's what takes a step sorry and takes a step toward the the watermander and says i would have liked to leave you alive but so be it and um steps up to like just like cold cock right cross right in the chest on who

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** This is actually an interesting question because it's an NPC attacking an NPC.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** So I need to grab my dice for the first time in this freaking game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:46]** Dice don't get rolled by GMs in this game.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** Not in this game.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** They do here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Someone said that.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Yep.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** She's going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** Is this going to punch her in the chest?

**[00:39:55 - 00:40:00]** It's not often you see somebody get punched just like right in the chest, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Solar plexus.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:13]** So you hear the salamanders on her chest like crunch a little bit as she takes the brunt of that right in.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** The breast.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** That's a horrible thing to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Right?

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** The armor, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Wait, so there's just a bunch of salamanders getting crushed right now?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Like their brains and stuff?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Yep.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** That's not cool, man.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** The bones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** You went straight to, like, their brains and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:35]** But these are magical salamanders, so they just kind of re-inflate after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:39]** All of their tails come off and then re-inflate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:43]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** I love that.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** This is tragic.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:57]** He is also going to flick his wrist to lash his whip at Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:26]** little baby hands yeah um yeah julia gets two attacks make a speed defense roll uh can i ease it because they're baby hands i feel like that's pretty reasonable yeah his hands are like comic book wolverine's feet you know yeah weirdly small how can we not get through any ip without talking about comic accurate wolverine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:46]** yeah i mean it was just meant to be you gotta you gotta guess after your own heart right kevin would be proud he'll probably shed a tear when he listens to this you're trained and so i'm trained in speed defense tests okay but i only rolled a four wow

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** This whip lashes against you.

**[00:41:49 - 00:42:00]** You feel the lash itself hit your incorporeal skin, but you feel the burr especially firing in your thigh.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:06]** And so you take four points of might damage from that lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Yikes.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Feel the burr?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:13]** So if you look at the picture, there are little flames at the end of the lashes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** I just wasn't sure if that meant the flames or like the spiky end of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Gotcha.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:23]** No, the end of the, like where the bone would be if this was a cat of nine tails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Okay, cool.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** God, this is... That's, yeah.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** That's almost half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** And that is the end of Kyaren's turn.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** What do the rest of you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** I... Yeah, are we tied?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** I think we're all after them.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:50]** Mechanically, in battles, it's basically, like, the bad guy or bad guys, and then whoever goes before and whoever goes after, you guys just decide amongst yourselves.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** The order is really loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** I want to go ahead and go to get something out of the way.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:04]** He sees, you know, Iris sees the watermander, you know, in danger.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** It is his friend.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:09]** He's not typically brave generally, but he pulls out.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:18]** The cipher that he's been saving for just such a moment as this, which is a level six spirit conjuration cipher.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:29]** So he pulls out this like giant walnut and like cracks it and spills the contents of it, which must be a lot, into like an X on the ground.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** It says a crossroads shape on the ground.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:35]** And it summons a level two spirit, a ghost or a haint.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** that can understand your verbal commands.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Once it is summoned, commanding it is not an action.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:47]** The spirit can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its ability, but it can't speak.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** Never goes farther than long range from me.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:56]** It responds if attacked, but otherwise only does as commanded, and it remains for 10 minutes per cipher level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** So for an hour.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Wow, that's great.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Okay.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** So what's it going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Go attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Yeah, and Ira's like, go get him.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** I'm not going in there.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Go get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Cool.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** So you've got a level two spirit.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** You need to roll and attack.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Okay.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** 18, my boy.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Wow.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Nice.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** The most unlikely of outcomes.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** This spirit.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** What's the spirit's name?

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** Well, I don't know because it can't talk.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** Right.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** What do you want to name the spirit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** I think it's Ira's grandpappy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:59]** um who died are you sure you want to do that to old pappy never mind i hate my grandpappy he was a mean old drunk all right cool so pappy the spirit um pappy i imagine it looks sort of like that like 1800s boxer with the oh yeah yeah ducks and dives and just like list


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:03]** Yes, it's the Sullivan kill rain type thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:08]** Throws a punch with the back of his hand and catches Kjarn right on the nose.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:16]** And you see his head duck back where you found purchase on Kjarn's face.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Well played.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** Okay.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** Nice.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Zoa, Julius, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:26]** Uh, well, so what has a, so what do we start off at level one, right?

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** We don't start off at level two, three or whatever.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** It's just one.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** What are you going to do?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Is that correct?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:36]** Well, I'm asking because like, I already used a level six cipher.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** So I guess he's like leveled up enough for something like that.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** I'm not even at level four cipher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** You can use whatever ciphers you want.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Ciphers have their own levels independent of yours.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** So like, these are one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** I thought we had to level up as a character to use them.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** What's the point of XP then?


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:56]** You can use it for other things, like increasing stat pool, an edge of your choice.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Yeah, making you stronger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Yeah, we put it in the chat.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** You can use it to reroll any die.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Yeah, this I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** I just for some reason thought you had to apply it to shooting cycles as well.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Oh, well.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** So, okay.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** Okay.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:11]** Never mind.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Got some ciphers, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Smoke if you got them, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** Smoke if you got them.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** My f***ing ciphers just are terrible for everyone else.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** I'll just put it that way, so I'm not going to do it.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** What is it, like, fireball spell?

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** It's basically, like, you get a cool thing and everyone else gets to f***ing suck.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Like, that's, like, all of my ciphers.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Like, it's really bad.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** It won't be good for you.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:36]** So, he unfortunately can only attack with his rifle and then get Clemmy.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:40]** By the way, Clemmy f***s herself, like, seeing all these salamanders get crushed.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** But she's going to get ready to attack too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:49]** So shoots his rifle and does like a roll, which he's going to do now.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** Attack roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:52 - 00:47:13]** like a natural 20 what that's right let's go in way enraged by the salamander violence yeah how dare you do that to clammy brethren so and he shoots yeah i don't know why i haven't bookmarked this page but it's like if you roll a nat 20

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:16]** You get an extra effect, like a massive.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Yeah.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** That's what I'm looking for.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** Like, what is that massive effect?

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Major effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** You pull the moon out of the sky and it lands on Kjarn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** That would be amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Sticking up like Wizard of Oz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Stand by.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Minor effect.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Oh, there we go.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** When you roll a natural 20 and the roll is a success, you also have a major effect.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** This is similar to a minor effect where the results are more remarkable.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:43]** In combat, a major effect inflicts four additional points of damage with your attack.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:52]** You could also instead choose to introduce a dramatic effect, such as knocking down your foe, stunning them, or taking an extra action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Nah.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** I think it's just better to do raw damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Just do the raw damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Yeah, but then it would just be attacking again.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** So I'm just going to do eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Wow.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** That would be the total amount for the game.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** You fire...

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:25]** center of mass and it just like you can see what would ordinarily be blood but appears more like black smoke just oozing out of kiara elden ring ask that was so

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** It's disturbing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Mighty interesting.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:34]** It's like the gaseous body underneath all those gross yolks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Okay.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:44]** As the smoke dissipates from the barrel, he just kind of winks at Clemmy, and Clemmy runs up the barrel of the gun and goes to attack.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** And Clemmy...

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:53]** It's a 12 to attack for the Clemmie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** Maybe she's too freaked out by what happened to the other Salamanders.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** She's shook.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:05]** She wills herself to jump, but her hands won't release from the gun.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** She's just stuck there.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** At least she's here.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** It's alright, girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Take a break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** I have an ability called the Ribbits of Darkness.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** It hinders...

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:45]** any task for the creatures in the area and it is no bigger than an immediate distance in diameter so if i were to cast it at kiarn trying to kind of blind kiarn and hinder all of kiarn's actions would it also hinder ours like is the space small enough or like would it hinder our attacks would i know that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:52]** Based on how I'm reading this, you're casting darkness in this space.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:58]** So unless you have something that would allow you to see in darkness, it would affect all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Which I do.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:04]** But better if we're trying to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:10]** Is it like in other game systems, like magical darkness?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** Or is it just like it's dark and you can pull out a lantern?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:16]** I think it's going to be Magical Darkness.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** That old pesky Magical Darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Come across it just trying to walk down the street.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Get out of here, Magical Darkness.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Yep.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** All right.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** So he's not going to do that.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:32]** I burned out a halogen trying to get through Magical Darkness once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:38]** He's not going to do that because he realizes that that would only be best if we're trying to leave and he can leave people out.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:52]** So instead, I think he is going to... I think he's going to use another bit of his shake the bones, and he pulls out another tooth.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** And then just literally... Oh, my God.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** How many teeth do you have left?

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Three now.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Let's get it called Paul.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Enough?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Yeah.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:27]** uh but they're ghost teeth yeah they're yeah they're they're ghost teeth but they're very good keep something good or is it one of those like when you pull a tooth out it like you have a tooth in your hand but it like poofs into into into cloud and then like forms another one sure yeah yeah so he has that's what i would go with instead of being snaggletooth


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Well, but he was, he didn't have that.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** So he did, he, he came into the afterlife missing teeth.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:33]** Right.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** So, uh, now he's still missing them, but at least they come back.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** So he pulls another one out.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** Poof.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** One comes into his place.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** He just immediately, uh, swallows it.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:54]** And then using that, that like in that just like swallow, he then pulls in all the energy from that as, as if it's changed his, his mouth, uh,

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:01]** And he says, you speak of falsehoods when you yourself are a falsehood upon this earth.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:13]** And he's going to cause two points of might damage, two points of intellect damage, causing the bones of Kjarn to shudder and shake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** And we are all within immediate distance of each other, right?

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** We're like five feet away from all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** In Starfighter terms, yeah.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Short range.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Immediate range.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Immediate range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Can I get further away from...

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** We're not in immediate range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:40]** If we want to leave here, I can help with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** He says I'm not terrifying.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** That's Julius.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** Top of round two.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Cole Ward.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Action is to you.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Machete time.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** He's going to swing at his...

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:00]** I think he's going to probably try and target the hand holding the whip.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Yeah.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** And I rolled a 15.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:03]** Nice.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:05]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:16]** I think at 15, you swing your machete as hard as you can, but it, like, scrapes against one of those layers of leather as if it's tanned armor.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Very close, but not quite finding purchase on Kjarn.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Um...

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:35]** You notice a hand coming over your shoulder, one that you've seen before, reaching down to grab you.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Make a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** 19, baby!

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** What's it going to be able to grab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:48]** You deftly dodge out of the way as the ghost guard that you saw earlier has returned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** Come on, man.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:54]** Benny, are you pulling Kevin's and multiplying shit?

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** Dang it.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** Cool.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** Kjarn does not like having holes blasted in him.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:08]** And so he is going to turn to Zoa green.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Oh, well, that's fair.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I did blast a hole on them.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** So, and just like front kick you right in the center of mass.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:21]** Again, before the attack me, what about his whip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Roll defense.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Roll.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** Just, I'm going to use the altruistic ability to,

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:58]** we're all in immediate range I'm going to take one of those points of damage whatever comes in I'm going to say like Cole sort of like tries to block it but he doesn't fully block it yeah that's awesome love to see it Cole protects what matters big titanium mic injury there he's a good man love that Zoe roll a speed defense roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:03]** All right.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Eight.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Thanks, Cole.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Thanks in advance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:12]** Y'all, don't forget about if you have any experience, you can cash them in to re-roll things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** You want to re-roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** I'll do that again.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:38]** here it's been an xp yeah how much xp do you have kelly yeah i have well i now have two i had three i rolled an eight again wow so that's good cool cool so you catch that foot right in the middle of you um cole takes one damage you take five because of his ability


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** To what?

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Might?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Speed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** To might.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Okay.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:46]** Might first, and then whatever pull you want after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Well, s***.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** What are you at?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Well, I mean, I'm not out of might.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Are you impaired?

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** What are you at?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Hold on a moment, please.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** So... Oh, actually... Are you zero?

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** No, I'm pretty good, actually.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** So... No, no, no, I'm not.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** No, I'm at seven.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Okay.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Yeah, so I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** Yeah, you guys healed before, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Did you say Cole took damage as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:14]** I took one, yeah, because I have an ability called Altruistic.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** How are you?

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** I've got...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:42]** i've got one seal that i can use i'm just waiting for somebody to get low yeah because it's it's a heel too full in your mic that's impressive that'll come in handy that's good for me and i've got a cipher that allows you to not die literally not dying if the damage would kill you you don't die for the time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** You got a veto card.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:44]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** Yeah, he's got a one-time use veto card.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:55]** It's a one-time use, so we gotta make sure it's... So, Kjarn then takes his whip.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:07]** Seeing Cole trying to defend his friend is not sitting well with Kjarn, so he's gonna whip at Cole.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Cole, make a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** You won't survive the attempt.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** That's a little 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** That is not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** You want to spend an XP?

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** So you're going to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:24]** I still also have my first recovery roll.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Just one action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** There it is.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** Okay.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** One of the whip, like three of the whip tendrils.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** I'm going to throw a GM intrusion at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** You want to use two XP to refuse an intrusion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** Yes.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** No, it's 1 XP to refuse an intrusion.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** But you're giving up 2 XP.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** I don't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:49]** Because if the intrusion goes through, I give you 2 XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** So it's a net 3 XP swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** I feel like there's a dodgeball line.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Yeah.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** On a 4 XP range.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** Yeah.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Really?

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Yeah.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** That's a three point swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:13]** So the whip embeds in your leg and he yanks it back and you fall prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:17]** So I gain two XP if I don't intrude this?

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** Basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** What happens?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** So what happens is, I mean, you take the four.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** It's going to be four damage.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** So two damage.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** Yeah, it was two additional damage.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** You get an XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** Okay, but I have the armor, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** So two total damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** What's your armor level?

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:38]** It's 75.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** It's medium armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:54]** uh right i think medium armor is too so you would take two damage yeah okay nice and you took one yeah okay he gets one five cool uh so you get to keep one you get to give one xp to another player


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:54 - 00:59:02]** Yeah, I'm going to give XP to Zoa, who also was in this fray and just spent an XP.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** And I will have now four XP.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** What?

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Oh, you're rocking, dude.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I can just spend one and get four to my stat pool, too.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** That would be wild to do mid-combat.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** I think we would have to work that out.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Can you do it mid-combat?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** I don't know if you can.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** I don't know if we could make that make sense in the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** I mean, not with that attitude.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:26]** Cool.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:30]** Such a letdown.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** That is Kjarn's turn.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Ira, Zoa, Julius, who wants to go next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:40]** Julius wants to try and help out because he's seeing Colt go down.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** He's seeing Clemmie get scared.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:48]** He's seeing Zoa take a bad shot but then get hit right in the chest.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Right in the center of Mass.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:57]** And he is going to say, we have taken out a Y thing.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** We have bested a river.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** We have bested ghosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:08]** At the river comment, the waterman's eyebrows go way up.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** Bested in a friendly way, I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]** We're going to have dinner next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** I bested that river.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** I went and got coal out of it as a bear.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** And Ira became a bear.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** This Keon.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:26]** This is really poor timing to not be a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Of all the times.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** This Keon is nothing.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** And I'm just going to use my encouragement for free as my action to ease everyone's attack tests.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:42]** Because the 15 that didn't go through from Cole was a little alarming.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** So if we can make that a little easier, he's going to encourage Toy Evabata.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** That's Julius' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Hell yeah.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Okay, Zoa, Ira?

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** I feel like those that have cool effects that don't kill other people like mine should go before me.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** Just in case they want to use them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:06]** So, I still have my haint or ghost or whichever.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:10]** I would like Grandpappy to go whip some... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Roll an attack with Grandpappy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Okay.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** 15, but I know that misses, right?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Great.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** Didn't you ease everybody's attacks, though?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Does that include the ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Does that include the ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** It should, because he's a party member that I summoned.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Your ally is within short range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** I guess he's an ally, and he's within short range.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** So, yeah, that would ease it enough.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** You're doing the Lord's work.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:42]** For Grandpappy to just bop him on the nose one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Heck yeah.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** Alright, well that's Grandpappy's turn.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** It does not cost me an action to command him.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:59]** And so, as Ira, who's not a good attacker, I would like to spend two intellect points to once again do applied observation.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:08]** So I'm going to be like studying him from, you know, trying to like creep off into the corner even though he can't get far away and just like...

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:35]** really observe kiarn to the best of my ability um so you observe or study a creature object or location for a round the next time you interact with it uh a related task such as persuading the creature attacking it or defending from its attack is easy okay so which one do you want uh persuading attacking or defending attacking i don't there's no persuading this dude uh it's just it's gonna be attacking

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** I mean, it could be defend, I guess.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:43]** Yeah, he's kind of got all y'all that he's beaten up on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** To be fair, you haven't landed any shots.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** Not yet.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Cool, so you're taking attack.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** And I won't this turn either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** Zoe, what are you doing?

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** So, can do what he can do, which is attack.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** So he's going to shoot again.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** Aim, fire.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** A 19 on the die.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Plus the ease.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:10]** A 19 on the die gets you a miner.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:13]** A miner steps out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** Yeah, a person in a mining helmet.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** With a pickaxe.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** Yes, another party member.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:24]** That's my other grandpappy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** But they can only mine.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** They can't attack.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** They can only start mining.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** That's the problem.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Oh, that sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:35]** Let's go distract.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Minor effect.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** You could knock the foe back.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** You could distract them.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:43]** or you can do an additional three points of damage.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** Let's do an additional three points of damage.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** That will be seven damage in total.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Yeah, that's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:48 - 01:04:02]** That's seven damage in total, and what Zoa does, I think he channels his ranger abilities being backed into the corner and sort of internalizes the bear, right?

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:08]** If he can't be a bear, because Ira's the bear, but he's going to, like, what would a bear do?

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** A bear's going to hunker down

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:26]** um he thinks about what ira did before you give him inspired both barrels of that rifle and with that shot you pop yarn's head off what so life's in some weird way or is it actually good

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:51]** As he falls, you see the layers of dead skin and matted aged human leather crack and ash and turn to dust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** Booyah, but also gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:55 - 01:05:00]** And the only thing that remains is the devil's lash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** Is that like an item that we can steal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** Already done.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** I've already stolen it.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** Oh, it's gone.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Oh, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** It's like Skyrim.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:13]** It just instantly goes into your inventory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** In Ira's pockets is the devil's lash.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** Oh, actually, hang on.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** I need to roll something real quick.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** What about the ghost?

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** Oh, the ghost f***ed off.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** Just like I did one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** Not my monkey, not my circus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** I mean, Kjarn died.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** The ghost f***ed off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:41]** That ghost said, my name is Bennett, and I ain't in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Um...

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:51]** And so with yarn out of the way, I don't know how I've gotten my pages so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** The water made her last.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** You have.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]** You fell into my trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** It was me the entire time.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:01]** I was acting as yarn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** He was weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:07]** Where do you think the people leather came from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:09]** Gross.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** Now we need more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** So gross.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:14]** Your flesh will do fine.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** Such sepid skin.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** I'll skin your salamander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:23]** Is that a euphemism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:29]** I'll skin your salamander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:32]** That is an episode title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** I think it's a challenge worth using.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** I'll try to use it.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Challenge accepted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:53]** With Kjarn defeated, the watermander dissipates her salamander armor and a couple probably come over to Clemmie and make nice and be friends.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** I steal one.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:57]** Jesus Christ, Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** I'm kidding.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** Can we take some of these with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** I like it.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Let's take a few.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:06]** She turns and says, that was incredible, guys.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:10]** I've never seen anything like that, Kjarn.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Such a big bully.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** I'm really thankful for your help today.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:21]** You can bet that I will remember this.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** The river will remember this.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:28]** That door to the deep is safe under my watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:32]** You all right something about this Landlick company, though?

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** They might come back for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:41]** Yeah, with Kjarn dead, I'm sure they'll send something else, but I'll figure it out just like I figure out everything else.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** I want you all to keep that conjure deck now.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Something to remember me by.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:52]** And she gives you the conjure deck to keep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:55]** We have like a Yu-Gi-Oh deck now.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** That's freaking awesome.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** You've activated my trap card.

**[01:07:59 - 01:07:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** We get an achievement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** To the Shadow Realm.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** Blue eyes, white possum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** Also episode title, man.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Also episode title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:14]** Could you talk to your river about my ship?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:17]** Because I am in need of a new boat.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** A new possum boat.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** I need a new possum boat.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:22]** It needs to be able to be operated by possums.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:23]** We'll get there.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:26]** I'll get, I'll get to talk to you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** So I, I, I think I can, I can work that out.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:33]** Why don't you head back on over to, over to town and I'll make sure the river gives you back.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** I'm sure it was a big old misunderstanding anyway.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Thank you.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** Yeah.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:43]** So I run, well, hold on the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:49]** I were kind of like sort of timidly, uh, approaches, uh, the water Mander.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]** And, uh,

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]** you know, shuffles up, like kind of embarrassed.

**[01:08:53 - 01:09:03]** Cause he didn't really do, he summoned something, but he really kind of just cowered, stayed away from the fight, but he kind of shuffles up to her, looks down and then looks back up at her.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:05]** There's, there's like a weird history there.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:10]** Not, not, it's not a euphemism thing, but he's like, are you, what are you from this?

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Are you all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** I'm all right.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Ira Murphy.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Are you all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Little freaked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** Yeah.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** Magical.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** Do that to you.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** I wouldn't know.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:22]** I think you might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:26]** And she winks at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:30]** You swing by my place next week.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** I might have a book you can hold on to.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** How about that?

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** Is that a euphemism?

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** Oh, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:36]** No.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** Either one.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:37]** Hell yeah.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:41]** You need to wash your hands before you take that book now.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** And you make sure you return it.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:45]** I don't want your sticky fingers holding on to it for too long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:48]** I wouldn't steal from you.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:55]** He says, thinking of anyone else in the world who he wouldn't steal from, you know.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** Like, yeah, I might.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:59]** But if you'll teach me magic, I won't steal from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** I think we can work that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** I'm glad you're all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Me too.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Thanks for all your help today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]** My family sends their best.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:21]** Obviously, they treasure their relationship and your help in all matters of the afterlife and understanding therein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** I'm happy to be of service.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:32]** And she gets a wistful grin as she looks you over and truly takes in your current state.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Yeah.

**[01:10:34 - 01:11:02]** yeah yes it is exactly what you see i am here both here and not here couldn't happen to a better family appreciate that all right he says like knowing what this may mean all right boys i think you might need to go catch up with uh a certain rabbit over in the woods now well well i don't like i don't know why we've got to talk to him again but yeah that's true we


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:11]** So, just to be clear, you are now protecting the town from the dam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** That's the short way about it.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** I'm going to work with the river to make sure that that dam never gets built.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:41]** couldn't have said it better myself right oh well all right then all right i suppose we'd be on our way then i was pleased to meet you miss wadamanda i assure you the pleasure was mine y'all be gotta go see a man about a rabbit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:45]** I think you might have to go see a rabbit about a man.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** That's also a twister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:50]** You are so wise.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]** Do you suppose Rabbit Rabbit will make Julius corporeal again?

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:58]** Well, now let's not get ahead of ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:02]** You may not want that to live, but I am curious.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]** I'm reminded of the Robin Williams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:11]** I can't bring back the dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:14]** I think you might need to go ask him about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:19]** You just going to stay here with your salamanders?

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** My salamanders and I will make our way home.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:26]** Taking a couple of them.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:33]** They, like, crawl their ways out of your pockets and follow her as you leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** Aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:36]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Well, at least I still have Clemmie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** Oh, no, Clemmie, come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** No, no, Clemmie's with me still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:43]** Well, you be safe on your way back, Miss Mander.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:47]** Elsewise, we'll have to come rescue you all over again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:48]** I will.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:50]** I will be safe.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** Don't be a stranger, Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** Oh, I won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Ira doesn't know a stranger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:58]** I'm pretty friendly with most everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:58 - 01:13:27]** yeah and with that you make your way out from the mine is that right yeah cool so you walk through the woods you actually have no idea how long you've been walking but you end up right back in the clearing where your fort used to be you see wait my fort um rabbit rabbit oh that fort in the worst shape he's ever been

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:57]** it looks like all of the wounds from his prior battle have reopened and it's clear to you guys that he doesn't have a bunch of time left he says I don't know how but you all did it you saved that town you saved this world from that darkness


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** You filled this out.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:03]** To the letter.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** And so is my final gift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** And he turns to you, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:12]** It's a choice.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** Julius.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:20]** Would you like to stay as you are?

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:25]** Or would you like to cross over into the great beyond?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:36]** So I will remain anchored here to this earth as a spirit.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:39]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:42]** Forever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** Or do I cross over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:53]** That's your choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:59 - 01:14:59]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** Using that what?

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** A lot of whoa moments.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:10]** Of course, you had to make it a little trickier there, Rabbit Rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:18]** I thought I might be coming back to my former self, but I suppose there is a limit to your powers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]** I can only bring you back so many times, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:34]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:38]** Oh, no, I died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:41]** He took too long.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:45]** I got a healing cipher.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:47]** My cipher prevents you from dying to the damage.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** Can I use it on you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:54]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:57]** He's like, can you hurry up, Julius?

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** Julius.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:00]** Julius.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:03]** Looks at the ground.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** Looks at all you.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:13]** He goes, well, boys, it's been real nice.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** It's been real nice to see you again.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:18]** I didn't think I would get this treat.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:30]** But maybe there are some things that I meant to stay in the cycle.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:35]** and come back in whatever way the cycle intends.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:44]** He goes over to give each of you an incorporeal hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** Julius?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Mean.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Are you leaving us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:59]** I have spent far too long being a steward of the cycle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:06]** That was the connection, is that he was a steward.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:11]** It's good to know there's actual stewards somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:13]** I've spent far too long being a steward of the cycle.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:26]** And it is beyond my place to assume that I could be more than that in my ghostly visage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:33]** I'm sure you understand about the cycles of this world, Zoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:38]** Many things come and go.

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:42]** I was hoping it would be a while before you went again.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** Yeah.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:50]** Clemmie, be polite to our friend and give him a lick goodbye.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:52]** And he kind of tears up.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:58]** Clemmie gives you a kiss, and he hugs your forearm back.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]** I'll miss you, Julius.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:10]** I wish we got to spend more time together these last several years, but I'm happy we got this day or two, at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:16]** I truly am, too, Zoe.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:16]** I truly am.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:21]** I'll always treasure it.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:21]** Don't worry.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** I'll be in that wind that you feel.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** I'll be there helping you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:27]** And all the old shenanigans.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:28]** Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** Help Cletus out.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** Be the wind at his back.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:36]** And I'll keep the windows open to listen to you.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** Roll by in the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:42]** He just nods.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:44]** He knows there's no more to be said to him.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:46]** Cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:51]** You have defended me and many others.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** Very, very happy.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:59]** Very honored to have been your friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:06]** And I too am honored to defend what matters alongside you.

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:09]** I understand your choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:38]** you always did there was always a tacit understanding between us even when we were trying to recall the same memory but then didn't you know it's fine it's alright that was a mighty fine drink we had that I don't remember now that's exactly it I'll keep shining and I hope I see you out there well you will in one way or another


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:41]** In the way that you live your life, you will.

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:43]** Bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:46]** You'll hallucinate while drunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:47]** What the fuck?

**[01:19:47 - 01:19:48]** I will be the absinthe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:51]** Might have some of that mushroom still left over.

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:52]** Yeah, right.

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:53]** Don't eat some shine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:58]** Julius Fox here with you, IRA Says.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:00]** Don't change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:08]** And Ira is like stern as he can be for a second.

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:10]** And then he just like breaks.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:13]** He says, oh, Julius, don't go.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:15]** I'm just about to get my magic next week.

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:17]** And now you're not going to get to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:21]** I'm sure I'll see it.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** I'm sure I'll hear about it.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** You're going to do great.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:28]** You're going to do great, Ira.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:29]** Don't change your luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:34]** I mean, I probably need to change a little bit.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:37]** Pretty good to get in trouble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:46]** But it did bring you here to saving the world, if not this part of our home.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:48]** So remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:50]** And you can see he's...

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:53]** having a hard time with it, you know?

**[01:20:53 - 01:21:01]** And so I'm just kind of like, does that like the kid like crying and just like trying to make themselves look like they're not crying, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:07]** And then it's like, all right, I get it.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:09]** And he tries to give you a hug.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:13]** I don't know if his arms go through or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:14]** No, they don't.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** Actually, for a second, they do.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** And then he's like, oh, psych.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:18]** Jokes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** You son of a bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:26]** Julius gives you all one last look.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** And then he goes over.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:29]** All right, rabbit, rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:32]** Let's see what's next.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:38]** And at that, you all hear Rabbit Rabbit sigh his last.

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:55]** And much like the ghostly friend Julius the Grand, you see an incorporeal version of Rabbit Rabbit take Julius by the hand as they walk off into the forest together.

**[01:21:58 - 01:21:59]** You turn around, look back.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:03]** Rabbit Rabbit's body isn't there, but...

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:10]** What you do see is the rabbit-shaped stone back in the center of your fort as it was.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:14]** You see all of the trinkets that you brought in.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:18]** You see the decorations and the logs you stood up.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:25]** The fort you built and played in as children that made you feel safe and hidden and unseen.

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:29]** And you see the world as it should be.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:34]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02
