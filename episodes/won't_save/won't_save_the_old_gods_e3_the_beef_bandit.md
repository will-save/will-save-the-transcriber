**[00:00:36 - 00:00:45]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains, ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper in the wind.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Yeah, I was like...

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** He's like, you all f***ed up.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** I gotta do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:42]** We have a contractual limit of one per season.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** I can't go over that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** That was part of my NDA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** This is going to be a real-time new one.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** We're one week into the season.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** How are all of our fantasy football teams doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Wow.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Great.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** Yeah.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Amazing.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** I won both my leagues.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Okay.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Nice.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** Well, it's not over, but I'm going to win both of my leagues.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** Unless, unless Debo gets, unless Debo Samuel gets like 37 points.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** I mean, you know, it's possible.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** It's possible.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** That's what I need.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** If anyone could do it, it's Debo Samuel.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:26]** I won in our league, our pod league, but I'm 30 points down with Debo in the family league, so we'll see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** All right.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** Are you playing Heath this week in the pod league?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** No, no, no.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** But I look forward to when I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]** No, but our situations in those two leagues are very, very similar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** That's surprising.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Who am I playing in the pod league?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** It's funny.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I was talking to my friend about this the other day.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:47]** I've been playing fantasy football for over a decade.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** But it's funny.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** It's morphed over the last few years.

**[00:02:52 - 00:03:01]** When we started the podcast, I started a very small, it's like a six-person league, but just people that are in Hideous Laughter's podcast and ours.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** And I've had that going for you win the prestigious banana trophy every year.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** No money.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:11]** But now, like I used to do a work league when I worked in restaurants.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** So I'd have three leagues going.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** And now I don't work in restaurants anymore.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** And I'm in my podcast league and your podcast league.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** All of my fantasy football leagues are podcast adjacent.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:28]** I don't know anything about fantasy football because I don't know anything about football for the most part.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:33]** But I am wondering, like, what do you... There's a little bit of kicking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** A little bit of kicking.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** They have the World Cup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Unfortunately, it is both.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Yeah.

**[00:03:41 - 00:04:11]** uh how much money like so you you it's anyway whatever team wins irl right like you know then you're like all right cool i got like that team knocked off so there's there's different ways to do it what you're talking about is more like a pick'em system where like you pick a team and then you pick a point spread to you pick your top performers on a team and try to match oh you make a fantasy team yeah right oh cool like actual players and then based on how they perform you get certain amount of points


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:18]** The draft at the beginning of it is like the biggest deal because that's where you get your foundational players.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** And then throughout the course of the season, you pick up and drop players and trade for players.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** But they don't have to be on the same team.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** Like I've got players on 10 different teams right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** It's an actual play game.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:32]** Yeah.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** It's a real-time RPG of sports ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:42]** We play a game based on people who actually play a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Yeah.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:48]** That would be like playing as us playing a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** Playing offices and bosses.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** Offices and bosses, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** You could do some kind of...

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:21]** fantasy thing and depending on characters from a show or whatever like how they do you could maybe win something i don't know how big is the pot in r slash is there like a bachelor and bachelorette fantasy league or like yeah there could be something like that i mean if you can bet on it you can usually play fantasy i'm starting one up if that doesn't exist already he's like i'm in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** Your pod league, isn't it 14 people?

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** I think it's 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Was it 14 last year?

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:35]** It was going to be 14, and then I didn't want to push it to play fantasy this year.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** I've played fantasy football for a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** 14 can be miserable.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Because you don't know who the bottom half of your roster is.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:45]** But yes, I think that league's like $20 buy-in.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Yeah.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** So like 12 people, 20 bucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Okay.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** That's cool.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** There is absolutely a Bachelorette Fantasy League.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Of course there is.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** That you just started, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** No.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** I mean, I'm looking at it right now from bracketology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** This thing I just invented is absolutely a thing.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** It's already been invented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** It's already been invented.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** I do wish that there was a Love is Blind league, because I would play that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** Yeah.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** I would definitely play that.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** You know what I would love to play?

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Old Gods of Appalachia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Oh, wow.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Got him.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Yeah.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** The transition was... No, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Hopefully we'll get there by now.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** Flawless.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Flawless victory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:28]** Once you can do a wheelie on a Segway, then you're... What the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** friendship?

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:33]** Is that like a kill animation in Mortal Kombat or something?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Friendship!

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Friendship!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:42]** Yeah, they shake hands or you bust out a cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** That's the Mortal Kombat Care Bears DLC.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** You all just agreed to hug it out at the end?

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Okay, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, it's how Teletubbies should have ended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** How did Teletubbies end?

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** Now I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:03]** That implies that you know what the ending of Teletubbies is, and I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:09]** Did they just like Majora's Mask that and just have the sun just crash into the Teletubby planet and they all die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** It got real dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** It got real dark.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** That sun is terrifying, by the way.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** And then the sun went out and then they had to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Yeah.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** The heat death of the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** Assassinated all of the Teletubbies.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** Yeah.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Lord of the Tubby's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** It's not that big of a deal.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** They just go off into the distance in the baby sunsets or something.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** That's lame.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Screw Teletubbies.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** So the baby sunsets?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:35]** Probably.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** Yeah, off in the horizon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:45]** My disappointment at this old kids show and its ending forever ago is immeasurable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Should we just have a podcast where we just rate old kids shows?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:52 - 00:08:01]** I wonder about somewhere with the oversaturation of podcasts in general the last 10 years, somebody's doing a Teletubbies podcast.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** Oh, deep Teletubbies lore.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Is Teletubbies on fandom?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** We've got to learn today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** Is Teletubbies on fandom?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Teletubby.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** It is Teletubby's whiskey.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Meet the Teletubby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Wiki, wiki, wiki.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** Okay, I was like, she drank whiskey.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Okay, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** There is a podcast called Meet the Teletubbies.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:25]** And it's the bottle is like Teletubby shaped for the whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Hold on.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** I have eight best Teletubbies podcasts for 2004.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** There are so many of them.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Oh my God.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** That's what it says.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Oh, come on.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:44]** The Teletubbies podcast niche and the Paizoverse podcast niche are like neck and neck in size and scope.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** What is going on?

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:51]** Okay, we'll play the Teletubbies TTRPG at some point.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** I'm down.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** That'll be cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** We'll do that and then follow it up with the Wendy's TTRPG.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Did you ever see the Wendy's?

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** There's a Wendy's TTRPG?

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** Go on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** That's the extent of the story.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** There's a Wendy's TTRPG.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Feast of Legends.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Yeah, Feast of Legends.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** That sounds so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** Rise from the deep freeze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:21]** I know the next project I'm invited to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** We'll run that on the Cypher system.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Oh, they have a book.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** There's a Cthulhu-esque monster that you can fight.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Oh, this is cool.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** I'm into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Is it like tentacle french fries?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Is it frozen patty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** Actually, I don't think Wendy's freezes there.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** Why doesn't this look like anything food-related at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** It's so weird.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Things that might attack.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** Large fry fiend.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** There's a place called... Beef Bandit.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Oh, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Freezer Burn.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Beef Bandit.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Oh, Freezer Burn.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** That's good.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Freeza Gorgon.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:00]** Vinny, I think you're going to have another chance at a segue here.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** I'm waiting to see... We ruined your perfect segue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** It was really good.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I think it was a little forced, but you know...

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:10]** It was forced, but it worked and it made sense.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Now it's not going to make sense to me.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** Forced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** Man, I'm just stuck on Beef Bandit.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Beef Bandit.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** I'm just imagining Smokey and the Bandit straight to TV.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** Smokey and the Bandit 6, Beef Bandit, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** Yeah.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** Oh, man.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** The skills of a...

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:52]** of a beef bandit do you want me to read some of them yeah sure of course okay so the triple triple strike can do three actions on each turn i'm sorry we're gonna ruin this just by we can't play it now right yes we can sure we can we're gonna yeah are we pivoting this slap in the face the beef bandit removes his glove and slaps his opponents across the face doing 3d 4 plus 3 physical damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** Wait, so the beef bandit- That's a lot of damage for a glove slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** The beef bandit is- And 1d4 emotional damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Yeah.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:09]** But my favorite two skills is there's the so, with like seven O's, six O's, salty.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:16]** The so salty, the beef bandit casts a cloud of salt into the eyes of an opponent within 10 feet.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:21]** The opponent must make a grace roll of 17 or higher, or they'll have disadvantage on attacks.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** And then probably my ultimate favorite, swift kick in the pants.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** The Beef Bandit busts out a quick super kick, and he doesn't even slap his thigh.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:43]** The Beef Bandit must make a grace roll against his opponent's defense rather than a standard strength roll, doing 2d12 plus 3.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** What level is this adventure?

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** I don't know, man.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** It's a lot, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** It's like level 5 at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:51 - 00:12:02]** If you're doing God-tier stuff in Wendy's TTRPG, then... Speaking of salt in the eyes, when we last left our party... I'll give it to you.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:07]** The tears were rolling at the Whispering Pines funeral home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:31]** uh last session we did some exploring of the town we paid a visit to the general store general store general store where we met miss pop quiz anybody remember oh i have my notes up oh what is right now i don't know man we met wilma and cal baker you took the words right out of my mouth

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** owners of the General Store.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** Cal now has beef with Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Oh, is he the beef bandit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** He's the beef bandit.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Cal's the beef bandit.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you pesky kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:55]** We spent some time with Duke Davis, the bartender at the Speakeys behind the General Store, inside the General Store, depending on how you think about it.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:00]** Explored some of Cole's background as a bootlegger and Ira as a general shysty dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** A general untrustworthy person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:12]** He likes to throw wrenches into things, I've noticed.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** So we almost ruined a relationship.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** That was good.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:15]** It was great.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** It was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** We got some XP, though, along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:28]** We discovered that this boat, at least in our headcanon, is now opossum-powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Opossum-powered, for sure.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** No, it's not just headcanon.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Opossum-powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Opossum-powered.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** Opossum-powered.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:55]** And then we popped over to the Whispering Pines where Julius led the group to the office and we left off with Mr. Cooper the Grand saying hello to his very recently deceased son.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Well, he's in for a surprise.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** That was pretty crazy, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** And here we pick up our story.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Dad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** Dad, you can... You can see me?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Dad?

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** He starts waving.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** Dad, you can... Say that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Hi there, son.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Are we doing a mirror?

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:26]** There's... I would tell you you should sit down for this, but I guess you can sit wherever you want.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yeah.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** I can sit wherever I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Wait, okay, sorry.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** I'm a f***ing ghost.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** What is going on here?

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** I mean, it

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** You know, it makes sense.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** I've heard stories.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:45]** You know, Grandpa talked about it, but I didn't ever see you actually commune with any of the ghosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Commune might be a bit of a strong word.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:54]** Maybe we should talk a little bit about our family business, as it were.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:01]** Where do I even start?

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** Your father, Cletus, inherited this business.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** No, hold on.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Okay, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** But didn't exactly grow it on his own.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** He had help from others.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Others.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:34]** who, um, in exchange for burying bodies in particular ways, they would, you know, grant him success and power and influence over the community.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:45]** And, you know, we were able to figure out he, he eventually shared with me, uh, at some point the, um,

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:57]** reason for all of his success, you know, a funeral parlor in these parts doesn't make too much money, but he had a nice horse and plenty of, uh, things for us.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:17]** And so, um, the, the short answer is he'd made a pact with, uh, the most evil character you could have ever imagined the beef that he, and that he, and this beef bandit, uh, he would bury these bodies in the woods, uh,

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:29]** And, you know, he took me out there as a child one day and, you know, you talk about seeing the ground swallow up whole anything.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:41]** And you could see teeth made of pine cones and a tongue of roots and it just ate that body and for a time that worked.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:49]** And so eventually I figured out that this being was consuming not just the bodies, but the souls.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** of those that my father was taken out of there.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:59]** And so I started looking for help and lo and behold, uh, uh, met a metal lady.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** You probably heard of her.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** She's named the water Mander.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:05]** And, uh, she helped me find a loophole.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:28]** in this oath that my father made and now we've you know I'm still able to uphold his part of the bargain I am still burying these bodies out in those woods but as you can see we've got a very particular place that we put them in now and it's appropriately warded and shielded and you know she's been helping me take care of all of that

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** Because I'm still holding up that oath.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:35]** I still have some of my dad's old powers.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** I guess part of that includes being able to see you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** This is such a bombshell.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:44]** I don't even know where to begin.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:49]** This is clouding my mind more than the water next to the river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:01]** Well, Julius, there's a whole lot to unpack here, and I would love to do that at some point, but I think right now there's a little bit more of a pressing matter.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** As I'm sure you've heard, this watermander's gone missing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:21]** Oh, well, I'll let my friends share, but we are engaged to go see the watermender and speak with her about some pressing issues for the town of, what was that name?

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** Langley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Yep, Langley.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** That's actually the next thing I want to talk to you about.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** They're trying to put up that dam.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Have you heard about that dam?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Yeah, we have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Boy, howdy.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Damn, damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Damn.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:41]** You know, as time passes and the river reroutes itself, it does so to protect this community.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** You could think of it as almost a living being.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:49]** Well, thankfully, my father kept track of where those holes were.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:58]** And if that river gets rerouted by that dam, that gateway, that's going to be opened up.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** Turns out to be one of them holes that my father was feeding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:06]** What comes out of them holes if that happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Nothing good.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:15]** All I know is my dad's been feeding it for decades.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** What the fuck was that?

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** I got bit by Sirenscape.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Yikes.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Is that okay?

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Yeah.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** We'll just ignore that.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** Yeah, I'll take it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** Well, I mean, you deal in ghosts and stuff.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** It works.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** No, ghosts.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Sheesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** All I know is my father's been feeding it for decades.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** It's grown more and more powerful.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** If that river thinks it's bad news, everybody else does.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** We need to keep it at bay for as long as we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Okay.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** When was the last time that you saw the Waterman?

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** We came here.

**[00:19:49 - 00:20:00]** I wanted to see you and Ma, but we also thought that, just like you said, I knew that you had dealings with her, so we thought you might have some more info on when you last saw her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:07]** I last saw her, I don't see her too regularly outside of just roaming around town.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:12]** But the last time I saw her was at her place up in the woods.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** It was probably a few weeks ago.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:21]** As I understand it, she's been in town shopping for groceries as recently as just a few days ago.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:27]** She definitely needs some help, that's for sure.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:37]** Well, you remember Zoe's love for opossums, and we're about to be taking the opossum boat up, try and go see what she's doing.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** That is what we're going to be doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** The opossum palace is still purring along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** She's still all right there.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** Cletus is also the name of the head of my possum.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** He's the main possum.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** He's named after your daddy.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** You remember that story, though.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** I told you that many times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** That's Cletus Earl, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:17]** yeah that's right versus clevis they look similar but clevis jones yeah no that's my grandpa i mean that uh that that i don't exactly believe in karma but if it did you know that might be my daddy come back as a as a boat fair and possum who knows


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:22]** Well, that old possum's powers unmatched when it comes to Appalachian propulsion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** That'll preach, Cole Ward.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** That'll preach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:36]** Appalachian Propulsion would be a great name for a very specific kind of metal band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Southern sludge metal.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Moonshine metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Like banjo metal.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Moonshine metal, banjo metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** I'm in.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Let's just start a band.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Banjo core, I guess you'd call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** You've got the gut bucket and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** Well, look, I hate to say goodbye.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** I have a lot of questions about why I'm here.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** Maybe you know about the rabbit rabbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** But let's let's get to that later.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:14]** Is there anything that you three looks at his friends that you three want to ask my father?

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** We haven't already talked about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Nah.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** I'm with you, fellas.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Yeah, all right.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** It's fine.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Mr. LeGrand, if you ever want to take the posse palace, you let me know.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** We'll go up with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Oh, I will.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** We got more pressing matters, it seems, to get to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** We do.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Paul, tell Ma that I love her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:48]** Look, I wasn't expecting to be where I am now as of 48 hours ago, but I'm going to do my best to come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** All right.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** I promise you that.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** My work here ain't finished.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** All right, boys.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** He gives you a long hug around your neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Can you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** And his arms go through.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Yeah.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Am I at all corporeal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** Well, I think you are.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Like, you can interact with objects.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** What the fuck is happening?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Yeah.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** Wild.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Wild.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:19]** I loved that your first sort of action in the episode as a ghost is like, yeah, I can sit anywhere.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:22]** In my head, I was like, weird ghost flex, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** All my life, I've been wanting to just sit wherever the hell I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:31]** I can sit in the center of the earth if I want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** That would be cool.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** I think that's one of the few times that you've seen Cole really smile.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:41]** And when he does, you can see that he has a couple teeth loose.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** Just look like they've been yanked out.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** All right.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** That's rough, Cole.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** That's rough, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** All right.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Where are we going next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** I think we're heading to the podcast.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** We're heading to my little estate.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** So follow me, yeah?

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** All right, folk.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** You wouldn't even care about the Beef Bandit.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Oh, man.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** And it just slaps the shit out of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Is the Beef Bandit like the Hamburglar?

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Is it just like the Hamburglar?

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** He's the Hamburglar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** He's a legally distinct entity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:45]** He has some really shitty version of the Grimace next to him.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:48]** He's not like... They call him the Smile.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** I don't like the way this is going.

**[00:24:53 - 00:25:02]** So as you're making your way through the woods, you feel sort of a presence watching you from afar.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Give me an intelligence roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** All right.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** Let me bring up my virtual die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:37]** yeah just one person or everyone um i'm gonna say just zoa okay it's me because i probably up somehow okay so uh so yeah that's a um you know what you can't give me an intelligence girl but an intellectual 20 uh yeah you can base 20 okay uh 20 on the die


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** If anyone knows what it is, what is a die?

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** What is a die?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** It's a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** All right, cool.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Cool is just one.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** Cool is just happily walking through the woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Okay.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** So it just goes blind instantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Right.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** So did Julius or Ira roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Yeah, I rolled a 13 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** I got a 7.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** Julius is still thinking about his pawn.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** We all suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:15]** Let me see if Ira has any benefits for this.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** No, but I think he rolled well enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:23]** I have an intellect edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:31]** Do you have any skills that would apply to... I also have that edge.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** You looked at all my skills.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** I was about to list them all for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Yeah, I've got your character sheets here.

**[00:26:42 - 00:27:00]** So, you notice, because it's starting to get to evening now, as you head off into the woods, you notice, Ira does, that there are a pair of glowing red eyes that appear to be following you through the woods.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Oh, cool.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:28]** that's unnerving yeah so yeah only only the two of them see that only iris sees that uh you get a free um gm intrusion because you rolled a one um oh no so it's a bad intrusion or a very happy one oh it's not a good one that's for sure it's the red-eyed beef bandit oh no oh no and the smiles no

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:46]** so i've heard stories i think you are so like shaken by everything you've seen today that you end up getting lost in the woods what the no um and i'm assuming you were leading the group and so you are all lost in these woods currently


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:46 - 00:28:07]** with but i'm from the woods currently tracing you yeah i know hey zoa do you know where we're going because i i think i've seen this tree twice no he like pulls up a rock and this is where you start to think maybe he's insane it's just like trying to like maybe it's all just a lie his life he's like cleatus

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Cleus, you there?

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** I really could get your help getting out of the woods.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** I don't want anyone to know.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** And he looks behind him nervously, like, right in front of you all.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** Like, but I'm a little bit lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:31]** I think upon seeing the red eyes, Ira goes to, like, put a hand on Julius's shoulder to alert him, and his hand goes through, and he's like, son of a bitch.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** And then just like waves at him like, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** Sorry, I tend to make myself a little incorporated so I can walk through trees.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** You know, it's a little easier.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** You don't have to dub yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, another weird ghost flex.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Anyways, y'all see these red eyes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Do we see them?

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** Yes, you all see the red glowing eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Hey boys, stop, stop, stop.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** What's that?

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Something falls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** We are gonna die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Hold on now.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Hold on.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** I have.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** We'll be all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** Another ghost flex.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** I can't help it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:14]** How far are these eyes?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Not too far.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** What does that mean?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** They're a short distance away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** That's the equivalent of yonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Over yonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** They are yonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:34]** And you flash back to when you were 12 years old and playing in the woods, and you noticed a creature with these glowing red eyes stalking you.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:45]** And you all ran together to your fort, to your place of safety, and it seemed like there was a way that it was trying to get you, but it couldn't get into that fort for some reason.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:50]** And you hear a near-human scream resounding.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:52 - 00:30:16]** in the back of your head it's a wendigo or something and this humongous white furry creature with big rams or actually i'll just post a link so you guys can see it okay post for a second i thought it was gonna be rabbit rabbit i was like oh it's like rabbit rabbit like double crossing us and it's actually stalking us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:34]** i pulled up our discord chat and the first thing i see is a meme of there is no wendy only zool and it's like a it's like a color contrast version of the wendy's girl i thought that was it for a second solarized yeah completely intensely bad all bad um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** There's a link that just says white thing.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Is that what you posted?

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Oh, God.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** There it is.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Where did you post it?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Oh, God.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** It's in the Riverside chat.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Oh, no.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** He looks kind of cute, actually.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:50]** I mean, if it weren't for the... Well, he looks pretty cute.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:56]** If it weren't for the... It looks like that thing that tries to kill Luke Skywalker on Hoth.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** It looks like that.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** With, like, ram's horns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:11]** It looks like a vicious, feral, like, Bernie's white mountain dog with a ram's skull, like, ram's horns curling around its head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Holy shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:22]** And because you, Zoho, were so distracted, he's going to pounce toward you.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Oh, great.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** And try to take a bite out of crime.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:29]** Roll speed defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** Okay, speed defense.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** All right, well, I guess I'll do that now.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** 11?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** 11.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:49]** I don't know if I... Do you have any special abilities or ciphers or skills you want to try to... Well, I have an edge to speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Okay.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** You'll forgive me for forgetting how I apply that, I hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** How do I do that?

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** Do I just reroll?

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:58]** No.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** So that edge would be if you wanted to apply effort, your first level of effort would be reduced by one.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:11]** And any subsequent levels of effort would be the normal price.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:18]** But you can use edge if you want to spend from that pool to activate a skill or to apply effort to a situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** Effort allows you to add points to your roll, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:26]** It reduces the difficulty of that roll by one level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** How does that help me right now?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:32]** I guess I'll just apply effort then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** So then you would spend two points from your speed pool and apply it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** You're basically trying really hard to dodge this attack.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** Reducing the difficulty by one.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:48]** I know what the difficulty is in my head.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:54]** So now you roll your d20 and it's now three points lower than it was before.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** So you've applied effort.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Go ahead and roll your d20.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** It's a nine.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** That's a nine.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Yeah, I'm rolling terribly.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** You are rolling rocks tonight, dude.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** Yeah, it's not good.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:15]** So the white thing takes a bite out of your leg and you feel it.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:40]** teeth sink into you and the wrenching of its neck is yanking away at your muscles it pulls back and you look down as if to to see what's happening in your leg is perfectly fine but you still feel every bit of pain from it taking a chunk out of your leg uh you take four points of might damage i'm gonna i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:42 - 00:34:06]** good use my altruistic ability uh and in seeing this i'm gonna say watch out noah and i'm gonna like nice try to try to pry open his mouth as he's clamping down it was like the butt of my machete and uh i get like you know maybe he like bites my hand a little bit yeah

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:10]** And I'll take one point of that damage.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Nice.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Away from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Cool.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Very cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Very dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Thanks, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** That is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Yep.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Okay.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** Since that was a surprise action, let's roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** First initiative roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** First initiative roll of old gods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** Do we just roll a d20 for initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Yep.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** So that is a speed roll.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:42]** Unless you have training in initiative like Cole does.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** I have training.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Yep.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** So what do I do?

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** So you roll a d20 and you let me know that you're trained in initiative.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:53]** I am trained in initiative, and I have a 19 on my die.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:58]** Julius got an 18 and is not trained in initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Okay.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** Ira is not trained either.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I got a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Okay.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Just a moment.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** And then 15 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Very good.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:19]** So Cole and Julius go first, and then the white thing, and then Zoa and Ira.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:37]** the top around two in this game uh it's really just before and after the monster you guys can decide amongst yourselves at what point you want to do what you want to do so cole julius you have the opportunity the element of surprise you two are quicker than this white thing what are you gonna do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:44]** Uh, Cole's going to take out his machete that he used to pry open the, uh, beast's mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:51]** And, uh, smack, smack out, try to try to swing at his neck area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** All right.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** Um, just like, uh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Trying to go for a killing blow.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Hopefully it's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Make a might roll.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** So I rolled a 19 again.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:17]** dude and that is just like that's op right my mind at minus two or it's minus one because i took one damage right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:38]** uh your mic is at minus one yeah so your your mic pool is currently 12 yeah you've rolled a 19 on the die which i gotta pull open my handbook here uh you get something i think you get a major thing happening oh is that is that right did i imagine that

**[00:36:38 - 00:37:05]** in combat that 19 is a major uh yeah let's see let's see let's see in combat if you roll a natural 17 or 18 you had one or two i made this uh nope that's protector um yeah but it was like a fifth tier protector so oh yeah it's not when you roll a natural 19 in the roles of success you also have a minor effect in combat a minor effect inflicts

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:24]** three additional points of damage with your attack or if you prefer a special result you can decide instead that you knock the foe back or distract them or something similar so do you want a minor effect or do you want three extra points of damage i mean i kind of want the three like i don't know what the minor effect is going to be

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:42]** yeah so it'd be something like a temporary maybe they they would be dazed for a round or like off balance so that they're easier to hit or to hit the next time yeah all right i'm gonna go for it nice for the effect or for the for the damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Three damage is a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** Three damage is a lot.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** You've almost doubled your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** Yeah.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** I think I'm actually going to go for the damage.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Okay.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** That's the protector choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** I respect it either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Yep.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** The protector who defends what matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** He is defending what matters today.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Yeah.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Me.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** I matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:25]** you bury your machete in this monster's neck in the scruff and you see its white fur start to get matted with a black ooze blood of this very clearly unnatural creature oh my god julius what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:30]** Alright, I'm sending to you in chat the language of what I want to do.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:36]** I want to use one of my speaker effects called Terrifying Presence, but I want to make sure that it's appropriate here.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Because maybe I wouldn't know this.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:44]** You convince an intelligent target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:52]** And for long as you do nothing but speak, the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the circumstances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Give me an intellect roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Okay.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:01]** And do I want to do, cause I have one edge and a larger pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** Should I do anything to, would love to ease that a little bit.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** I don't think you need to, cause this is going to be like an understanding magic roll for you.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Got it.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:31]** 17 okay yeah you would you would intuit that this creature is big and strong enough based on the bite it took out of zoa green's leg yeah yeah that it probably won't be affected much okay by the terrifying presence

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** by the terrifying presence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** Then I might switch, if I may.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:38]** I don't know how many times I can do this, but I'm just going to go overboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** Let me say that differently.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** Sorry, I had to read the rest of your skill.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** You would have to apply effort.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** for it to affect this creature.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Got it.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** Yeah.

**[00:39:52 - 00:40:00]** Instead, then I want to do Shake the Bones, which is very similar, but my words are essentially so powerful that I cause two points of might and intellect damage.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** But I want to make sure that that would... Because you caused might damage, right, Cole?

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Yes.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** So I want to do this.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Would I think that it could understand what I'm saying?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** It probably could.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Um...

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:20]** They could only understand Zul.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** That's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:49]** i'm just trying to lean into the speaker skills before i think it could it could understand like it's it's seen enough speakers before to know what's happening and there's enough like ingrained yeah yeah yeah you sort of how you know how like when a worm eats a worm that's already done a maze it knows how to do the maze totally okay like that so that's an intellectual um yes i sent you the the text in chat yeah i'm looking at your character sheet

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** Sorry.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** So I would want to ease this probably, too, in order to make sure that I get it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:59]** You can spend... I'm going to spend it.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Okay.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:07]** So then you're going to spend two points from your pool for one level of effort, or you can spend four points from your pool for two levels of effort.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** How many do you want?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Let's do one level of effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** So I'm going to reduce it.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** Do you tell me what level it is or do I just roll and you just go?

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** You make the roll and I tell you.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** All right.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Let's... God, I hope this works.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** 15.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:24]** Yo, this die, this D20 is loving me right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** 15.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** It's a good thing you applied that effort, is all I'm going to say to that.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Okay.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** That 15 is enough.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:43]** You have in your incorporeal body a bag of, like, bones you've collected from your walks in the forest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** I was going to say, yeah, good.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** You do it.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:52]** He like, he like pulls out this bag from inside one of his vest pockets.

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:10]** And then he takes out a bone like as quickly as possible, just, but with such assured confidence and he puts the bone inside his cheek and then he rips, he takes his hand, grabs one of his back molars and rips out the molar and all bloody.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** And he puts it in the other cheek.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** And then he swallows it.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** And when he speaks, there's this sub-bass to his voice.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** And he just says... It's like the weirding way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** You foul abomination.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:28]** You deserve to no longer walk on this earth.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** You will follow no one else.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** You will never see the light of day.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** You will join me on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** And then he fully swallows the bones and tooth.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** And does the might and intellect damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:47]** And you feel the very ground you walk on resonating with that magical power.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:55]** The white thing shudders in response, and you see it draw back and flinch at these powerful words that have just been spoken.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:05]** And it takes every bit of your four points, two of intellect, two of might.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** That is spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** I'm so curious to know the buildup of creatures.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** Is this a creature that has more might and less intellect?

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** We're such new players to the game, we don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** That'll be a great thing to explore in our Plot Over episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Yay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:33]** Be sure to check our Discord before that and weigh in on whether or not you think this creature is properly balanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** Or, you know, go to Monty Cook Games, buy the adventure, and have a look for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Thanks, Monty Cook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Thanks, Monty Cook.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** This is a great adventure so far.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:53]** You see it start to shake off some of the damage done, and it recognizes those who have befallen or who've taken swipes.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** He's coming back for revenge.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** So it first bounds toward Cole Ward.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:20]** maw a gape and tries to sink his teeth into your sternum cold ward make a speed defense roll bro all right i got a 14 unfortunately wearing armor oh um what's your armor score


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** The armor is medium armor.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Sheepskin lined coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** I'll have to look that up in a bit.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** For now, I'll say you have an armor of one.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** I think it's two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:35]** Light armor is like... The light armor is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:36 - 00:45:03]** one i think sheepskin is two and i take one penalty on speed perfect cool so when you take damage you take you basically have two points of damage reduction each time you take damage so he runs doesn't apply when i do the altruistic thing right but yeah um so you do your best to dodge and roll out of the way but it tracks you the entire time using its smell and its sight and just snap

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:29]** bears its teeth down on your sternum you take four reduced to two points of might damage as it wrangles you around it turns toward julius rears back and swipes with both paws at julius julius make two uh speed defense rolls two speed defense rolls i do have two speed defense rolls


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:37]** Okay, I do have the armor thing, where if I'm not wearing armor, I get a trained in speed defense when not wearing armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** So I'm trained in it.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** Did you also take a level in speed defense?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:59]** uh i'm it just says i'm i'm trained in it that was like one of the speaker things but i'm not wearing any armor yeah i got a 17 for my first one yeah and a two for my second one i knew this dice was gonna give out it's a skull die there's skulls inside so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:02]** It leads with the left paw.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:09]** In your first roll, you tumble to your left perfectly, but you don't see the right paw following.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** And it just slashes across your ghostly back.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:22]** And you see spectral blood flying through the air for four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** How is that possible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:29]** It has just smacked a ghost and two corporeal human creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** Yeah.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:35]** Ira Murphy, Zoa Green, what are you doing in the first round of combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** I think noticing that...

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:47]** The white thing was able to pick out the opponents that had attacked it and kind of went after them.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:55]** Also, being as far from a mighty character as I could be, I'm going to try to use applied observation.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** So it's two intellect points.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** But it says you observe or study a creature, object, or location for at least one round.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:11]** The next time you interact with it, a related task, such as persuading the creature, attacking it, or defending from its attack, is eased.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** So basically spending this turn to kind of go through the mental notebook and be like, what do I know about these?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Nice.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** What could this creature be and what weaknesses or strategies could I use against it?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** And it's kind of paralyzed by...

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:54]** his own uh mind just like you know going into overdrive by the shock of this and by trying to formulate a plan because he ira knows he is not a warrior you know um awesome so then that is your action ira murphy is doing his homework uh he's pulled out his abacus he is uh assessing this white thing for all he can zoa green what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:04]** You know, I forgot to work this out with you, but from the very onset, Zoa has like a level two creature of your size or smaller, which I mentioned before, but it should already have that.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:08]** So what I'd like to do is have a salamander.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** It doesn't really matter what kind of animal it is.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** It has the same damage and everything.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:20]** So if this is cool with you, I'd like to do a Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamander because I like the way that sounds.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:41]** um now this beast can like attack on my turn and i think it can stack with mine there's nothing that says that it doesn't but you know how i am so i just want to make sure that that's okay with you so is that fine sure well will you just say the name of the species again alligator it's a uh she's an alligator mountain dusky salamander

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** That's just fun.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** She's a beauty, but you could just call her Clementine.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Clementine, that's what I was waiting on.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** Clementine, like, crawls out of the shirt and, like, hangs out on Zoa's shoulder.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** Before... It starts, like, licking his face.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** Before, um... Now, Zoa's gonna... You take three poison damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Before...

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** You start tripping balls.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** Dude, that's the secret.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** You trip balls.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** This dude's out there living in the woods.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:14]** He's just getting high on salamanders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** He just trips that the boat exists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** It's just Clementine doing all the work of what would be 12 possums.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** That's horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Everybody looks more closely.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:28]** They've just ignored it for a while, but they look and all the possums, they're not possums.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** They're like floating pieces.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:38]** It's more like a raft than it is, you know, a powered boat, but they're just like hollowed wood carved possums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** We all have to lick and then we start believing it's like hook.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** And then we start believing.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** And then the possum boat.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Comes to life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Look, now, I'll do some solidarity drugs.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Yeah, always.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:50]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** My name ain't Ira Murphy.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** So we've retconned your salamander.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** You guys are such good friends.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** What do you do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:08]** Yeah, so Zoe has a rifle, so he's going to take the shot and shoot this thing, and then that'll be a cue for Clementine to go for it.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:14]** So now he has a rifle, medium weapon, long range, damage of four.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** I guess I need to make an attack roll of some kind.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Yep.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Yeah.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** So what is that?

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** That is a d20.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** As per usual.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Why?

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** It's an 11.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** I don't know why.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Maybe because I don't have modifiers.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** I'm not used to rolling so low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:41]** Yeah, that's... I mean, you fire and you see the round take a chunk out of a tree somewhere off behind this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** No!

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** Clementine, go!


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Clementine hops towards the beast.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:56]** And so Clementine can inflict two points of damage.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Yeah.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** You know what I mean?

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Can inflict two points of damage.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** So he's going to do an attack roll for Clementine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:04]** Okay.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Make your attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** Please let it be better than a middling roll six.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** What's the threshold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** Clementine, go and get that foul beast.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Clementine!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Get him!

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Scratch him!

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Lick him!

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:20]** To use the parlance of another game, Clementine, go get him.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:38]** Clementine gets as good as she can, but she gets tripped over on a pine cone and can't quite find purchase with her little sticky pig to get a slash on the little white thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:49]** The white thing accidentally licks Clementine, so now we have a tripping balls bear Wendigo thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** Clementine's eyes start to glow red as well.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** That is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Not my Clemmie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** I don't know what I have to do with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Clementine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:01]** Is that a where Allegheny Mountain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:05]** This is like a like a like a billy goat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Dude, this thing is humongous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** This is a billy goat on roids, man.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** So roided out billy goat.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** It's like the size of a small car.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** Billy goat liver king.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Awesome.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Well, that's the bottom of round one.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** We're now at the top of round two.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Cole Ward, Julius the Grand.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** Cole's going to go chop some wood, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Taking this thing out to the woodshed.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Can you?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** I was going to try and do something first to help encourage everyone else and take the action first since it doesn't really matter which one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Well, you still can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:53]** I mean, I think he was just going to see what's going on and say, boys, this is just like we've been playing for all our lives when we were young.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** We have done this before.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** We have faced tougher beasts in our imagination.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** This is nothing.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** And he's going to use encouragement, which is one intellect point.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:09]** Your allies within a short range, which I'm assuming all of us are, ease one of the following tasks of my choice.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** So defense tasks, attack tasks, or any skill tasks.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** So I think attack tasks.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** So here, I'll put the language in chat.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** So I spend another point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Sorry, go ahead.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I didn't mean to interrupt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** No, that was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** So do I get an extra point to my attack?

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** No.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Or how's that work?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Or do I get more damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** I think it eases the attack.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** The DC would be lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** I rolled a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:40]** So you're rolling to hit the white thing.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Yes.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:47]** It sounds like Julius's encouragement is to buff your defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** I said attack tasks.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** You said attack tasks?

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Got it.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** He did.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Cool.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:58]** In which case, your 15 on the die... 16.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** Your 16 on the die is, in fact, enough.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Nice!

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** So...

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** How do you hit this creature?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Tell me more about it.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:20]** I'm going straight for where I see that black ooze coming out of his... So as you see the ooze starting to run down the creature's neck, you aim right for the same gash and throw it over your shoulder.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:32]** You hear the squelch of metal on viscera as your machete finds purchase in the neck of this creature.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** It is still up and still moving.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Now, Heath, you had a question.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Did you have a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** Yeah, I had a rules question.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:47]** I am just curious about, so people can impart things to ease the difficulty of the thing, right?

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Do those stack?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** Can you ease something twice and get further benefit?

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Yeah, absolutely.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Nice.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** Because I was just wondering, because I'm doing the applied observation thing, right?

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Which could ease.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** So if he's giving me ease on attack and I could give myself ease on attack.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** So you've now eased the difficulty by two levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Yeah, let's go.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** That's correct.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:16]** Now it is time for the white thing devil dog's turn.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:29]** And you see it starting to sway and shake its head to maintain cautiousness and pat the ground to find better traction.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:36]** And the first thing it sees is Cole Ward with the ooze dripping from his machete.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** And he runs to you to take a bite.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** Roll speed defense, sir.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** to 19.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:54]** Cole Ward rolls out of the way, makes a sidestep like a trained dancer.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** It's incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** Cole, you should be fighting crime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Captain Moonshine.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:05]** I'm the one that's making the crime happen.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** You should be fighting the police in Pinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Who says I don't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** Feeling nothing but air, hearing the snapping of his jaws.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** This white thing isn't done with you.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:24]** He tries to take a second swipe out of Cole Ward with its hind, you know, kicker claw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** I roll again?

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** You roll again.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** With its hind end.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** I think he caught me off guard.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Oh, man.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** Take poison damage because it just farted in your face.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:47]** You hear the snarl and the thrum as it impacts you in the chest, and you take four points of might damage again.

**[00:56:47 - 00:57:08]** um you took two last time right with its yeah so yeah i'm down to six so you i hit you for four you reduce that by two because your armor oh right but i took one from kelly so that was 10 yeah and now i take oh now i take two more so that's i'm at eight yeah got it

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:16]** and he turns toward Zoa Green, who sicked his pet salamander on him and tries to take a swipe out of his other leg.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:20]** Zoa, roll a speed defense, please.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Zoa!

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Doing it, doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Twelve.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Twelve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** 12 is not enough.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:38]** You see its claws buried deep into your other leg and see the material on your pants torn and covered in red.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:43]** Now, it is Ira Murphy and Zoe Green's turn.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** What are you going to do?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:47]** How many points damage do I incur?

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** Oh, you take four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** Was it the salamander that just attacked?

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** Or no, the white thing just attacked you, right?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** Yes.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Do you guys have any armor?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Gosh, damn, damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:04]** I don't, but I get a bonus for not wearing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** All brain, no brawn is one of my skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:15]** I have something called appropriate clothing, which I guess is just druggy clothes.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** It's a whole bunch of tie-dye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** It's just tie-dye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** This is why I'm getting attacked so much too.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:25]** Standing out like a sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:28]** Are we still attack-eased from Julius?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** Yes.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Okay.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:34]** Well, I mean, if Zoa wants to do something, I will defer to you.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** I'm going to try to attack because I got a bunch of eases going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Go for it.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Go for it.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** I'll follow up on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** Okay.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** So I've got applied observation.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** I don't know what that looks like, right?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:51]** I kind of racked my brain, or Ira does, figuring out anything you can about this monster.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:56]** But I don't really know what information that would be that would make it easier to hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:03]** So you're like, I imagine because this is likely not the first time you've seen a creature like this in the woods.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** It's the first time you've been attacked directly.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:12]** You've seen its movements in this battle and you've kind of seen them from afar as a kid.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** And so I think you're kind of making deductions for where you think it's going to be in a moment.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** So you can hit it a little easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:29]** All right, so I've got, the only weapon I have is a throwing knife, which is a light weapon, but it says in eased slash hindered, it says eased.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** Is that another level of ease?

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** Because that'd be three levels of ease.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Hindered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:43]** Yeah, there's an eased and hindered column on the attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Sure.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** We'll say that that's what that means, and then we'll figure it out in the rules before the next episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Okay.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** I mean, I would assume so, but I've been wrong before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Sounds right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** Okay, so that's three levels of ease.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:59]** And Ira... Like, Ira is generally kind of cowardly.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:04]** The only bravery Ira really has is his...

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:22]** desire to learn magics and his boldness in the arena of theft but something wells up inside of him he sees this thing he's seen him before never been up close with one and this thing is like going after his friends


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:27]** I don't know if they're my friends anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:34]** I just tried to claw this beast jaws out from your leg.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** So you ain't calling me no friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** We're friends.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** You're certainly a friend.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** You're a meathead, but you're my meathead.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:47]** Okay, so I've got three levels of ease.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** I'm just going to roll to try to hit with this throwing knife.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** It does two damage.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** Now, if I throw this knife, am I just out of weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Until you go get it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** All right, well, this will be my one attack.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:04]** Okay, that is a 15 on the die with three levels of ease.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:11]** You chuck that knife and it hits right on this white thing's nose.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Nice.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** I'm going to throw a complication at you.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Oh, no.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** And it sticks into its nose.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** It doesn't come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** Oh, God.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Okay.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** All right.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:29]** Well, that's all the fighting I will be doing this evening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** You get one XP and you get to give one to somebody else.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:32]** Oh, cool.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Interesting.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** For any reason or no reason at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Right.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** I love the game of who to pick with them.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:46]** But I think, realistically, Cole is the one that's going to be doing the most damage to this thing.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** Especially since Cole just was like, we're not friends.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** He's like, look, we're friends here.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:56]** I'll give you this intangible thing that'll make you fight better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Love it.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** Oh, yeah, because you can use your XP.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** Yeah, you could use your XP to reroll any die roll.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** Doesn't have to be yours.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** Could be any.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]** Zoe Green, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** We start off with no XP, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:10]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Yeah.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** Okay.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]** So I like to heal myself so I don't die.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Okay.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:17]** But I can't remember how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** So on the left side of your character sheet, you see a thing called recovery rolls.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:24]** It's 1d6 plus 1 because you're a first tier character.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** Think of it like a short rest.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:32]** And you can do that in this game the first time you do it in a given day in a single action.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** The second time you do it, it takes 10 minutes.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Third time is an hour.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** The fourth time is a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** You spent the last day with me?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Right?

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:40]** Uh-huh.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:41]** Correct.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:51]** I have the generous ability, which allows allies who spent the last day with me to add plus one to their recovery rolls.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** I would give you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:53 - 01:03:04]** So your recovery roll, should you take an action to do that, would be 1d6 plus two that you can add in whatever combination you want to whatever pool you want up to your max pool size.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:12]** Yeah, because if he does another might strike against me or whatever, then I'm dead, right?

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:16]** I forget if there's death saving throws or anything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:21]** So the only way you die is if all three pools get to zero.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Oh, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:38]** yeah so what's your might pull out right now my my pulls at three so one more strike it's very likely i'm gonna be out of might but then he would just start taking away from my speed and intellect at that point is what you're saying right right okay i see

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]** Well, in that case, I could probably wait on it.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:45]** Maybe I... Yeah, maybe I... Yeah.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** All right, cool, cool.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Sorry, I'm just still figuring this out.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** Celebrate a strike!

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Yeah, Salamander is definitely going to strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:55]** If it helps, I can heal you next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** All right.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:57]** Sorry, I almost did hears.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** All right, thanks, Sarah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:02]** When you go down to zero, though, you're impaired, right?

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** So let's talk about the damage track.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:08]** If one of your pools goes to zero, you have the status of impaired.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:13]** When you're impaired, if you apply effort, it costs one extra point.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:20]** You ignore major and minor effect results on your rolls, and you don't deal extra damage.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** And that's it.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** If it's your speed pool that gets to zero, then you can't move.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** But that's really about it.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** Okay, gotcha.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]** You have one level of ease on your attack, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:31 - 01:05:01]** nice um yeah from from uh yeah okay cool so uh zoe's gonna like uh zoe's gonna like do another attack with his rifle so his legs are all chewed up at least in his mind so then he's like over there just kind of like propping up his rifle with his remaining strength you know come on come on and uh good lord it's like a four or something ridiculous uh wow i'm terrible and then like and then he's like get him

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** Sorry.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** And then Clemmie does a 15.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** And then there's some ease there, right?

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** One level of that.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:11]** Maybe finally Clemmie will land an attack.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** Clemmie does a backflip off a tree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:18]** You sound oddly British when you get angry.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:26]** My name is Clement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:29]** His family goes back real far.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** We go back real far.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:37]** So her little sticky toes go like... She flips back and she lands on his face is what I would like to have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:48]** Clementine sinks her little tiny mouth into that really sensitive area on a dog's paw between the two claws.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** And just like

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** Between the beans?

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Right between the beans.

**[01:05:54 - 01:06:01]** And you see the white thing jump up and down at this surprise attack from a little lizard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:04]** The tween bean pressure point?

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:04]** Yo!

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** That TBPP, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:11]** The tween bean white machine.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** That's my girl.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:16]** The Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamander.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** And that's the end of round two.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** Back to the top of round three, Julius and Cole Ward.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** What are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:29]** I think Julius, it just says while you maintain this ability through ongoing and inspiring narration.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:31]** So I think he's going to keep doing it.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** He's going to keep doing it.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** He's going to keep saying, that's it, boys.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** This is just like we talked about.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** All right.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** So you get another level of ease.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** Yep.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** I don't think I spend one more point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** Vinny, you'll have to rule on this.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:55]** But I have a special ability called Control to Feel where I can spend one might point and I inflict one less damage.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:59]** But I'm going to try to get this beast on its back.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:05]** And I imagine that I'm going to take the throwing knife that Ira...

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:09]** Stuck in this beast's nose.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:21]** I'm going to, like, grasp it and, like, maybe with my machete, stab at him to try and get him kind of rolled over onto his back so that maybe he can't attack in the next turn.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:26]** Yeah, like, grab the... Or be at least, like, hindered in some way.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** I don't know.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:30]** And then throw the knife back to Ira, not...

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** Maybe at the tree next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** He kills Iron.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:38]** Gets him right in the throat.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** You're too good at what you do.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:42]** So now there's two ghosts in the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** We can sit anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:53]** I was just going to imagine if that knife is lodged in its nose, you use that as kind of a handle and then maybe you hamstring it.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** Catch the back of one of the legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:59]** I will let you use the throwing knife as an asset.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]** To do this maneuver.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:04]** Nice.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]** It's a lot of actions that you're asking for.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:12]** And so make your roll and we'll see how much you get done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** All right.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** I'm waiting for the devil's bargain here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:21]** I also want you to know that it costs one might point and you have one edge of might.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** And so it's effectively free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Sweet.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:28]** So you're not spending it from your pool without you needing to.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Do it.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:30]** So I don't want you to die without reason.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** Yeah.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** I ain't dying.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:37]** Oh, that's called a crit.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:41]** Cole, you are impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** He really is.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** I'm so excited for this.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:49]** So, you... My God.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** Would you like to describe it, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:53 - 01:09:08]** I think just taking the dagger and I just twist it like in one swift move and this beast's head and then I just sort of like stab it with the machete and just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:34]** flip it onto its back so i think with a 20 you grab the knife and rotate and like this this devil dog can't can't resist like you've got a knife sticking out of its nose it's going to move with it rolls over onto its back with the machete in one swipe you meet the viscera that you've been cutting into this entire time and behead this devil yeah

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:48]** As you see the black ooze running out of this devil dog's head, you see the body deflate.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:54]** this devil dog starts to dissolve into the wind.

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:10]** And you notice that where you should have sort of like split open legs and bitten into torsos, there's no physical evidence of a fight whatsoever.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:15]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** That was fun.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** Cole's a badass.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]** Cole is a badass.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:19]** Yeah, man.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:25]** He's a protector with a capital P. If we ever play this game again, I just want to play Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** We can have four Coles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** Dude, I'm down.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:29]** I'm in.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:34]** I want to stab, take a knife that's in a bear's face, and wrench the bear's head.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** He's got some cool abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** He does have some cool abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:46]** I definitely got some Gears of War chainsaw vibes just from Cole, even though it's totally anachronistic and not right, but it's just the way that you handle enemies.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:48]** Control the field.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]** Hey, I did two of that damage.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** Yes, you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** I did two as well with my scary words.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:56]** I think Ira gets the assist on that one.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:58]** That was like...

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** He set the stage.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:01]** Well, with the knife, too.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** That's a cool way to play off that.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:10]** Like, you threw us a little curveball, and then to use the curveball to our at least descriptive benefits, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** Yep.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Totally agree.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:12]** Good stuff.
