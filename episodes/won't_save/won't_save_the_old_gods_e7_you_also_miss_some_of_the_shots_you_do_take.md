**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** Hello, family.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:23]** Gather round and let me tell y'all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:31]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollows and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale has yet to be told.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:35]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:46]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper in the wind.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:52]** Hanks and Burgers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the picking.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:05]** Welcome to WalkSafe, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** Hey, y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** I'm free as the butterfly right now.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** I'm not tightly bound.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Free!

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** I'm worried about you, Vin.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** You good?

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Yeah, I'm all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** You got some tight pants on or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:38]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** Just pull the drawstring on the leather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:45]** You got to, like, pull some of the other, right?

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Well, it's funny.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** I actually need to spend more time in the gym moving heavy things.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:54]** I stepped on a scale the other day, and it was not what I hoped it would be.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:10]** hurt your feelings it was borne out by how tight my jeans have become recently but i i already had skinny jeans and now they're like i gotta get poured into these things they're just barely hanging on yeah i think you're ready for the leather though dude right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:38]** it's all good man that's it it's hard to make the transition away from skinny jeans the person that i'm seeing right now wears like what modern people wear which is like the baggier jeans but and i don't understand i don't know how to do it like i can't i i'm stuck with like slim jeans and i can't go back to the past but i guess that just shows our age or something i don't know i feel like i i have recently try that i'm gonna try

**[00:02:38 - 00:03:02]** started to make the shift kelly so i hear you really just yeah yeah so just just find a pair that's straight leg uh-huh it feels nice it takes a bit they get really baggy though especially over here like people wear baggy shirt jeans like it's like 1993 like the old jinko jeans i've just been wearing the same jinkos for like yes those things are coming back

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** In certain places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** In Japan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Oh yeah, in Korea and Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** They're f***ing everywhere.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** I also feel like I just pictured Will as the immortal being that he is.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Just wearing Jinkos the entire time.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:21]** So, like, it's like, you know, the, like, crusades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** It works for Will anyway.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Jinkos, you know?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** So, did you guys wear Jinkos?

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Like, were you Jinkos?

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:53]** i never had a pair either no yeah i didn't have ginkgos either i mean i knew people who did and i was like this is dumb i had the chain though the biggest like chain that went from your wallet all the way to your front pocket yeah yeah i mean when i was a teenager for briefly i did that yeah i think i think like for eight months


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:53 - 00:04:15]** that lasted when i was like 17 and in rock bands and thought i was like my career prospects were like i'm gonna be a rock star obviously that was that was the chain wallet era just like toss it around above your head like when you finish a set or whatever that's cool if you want to gauge for how cool i was then i thought i was going to professionally play trombone for the rest of my life

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Yeah, dude, it is.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Paul Weichel did, right?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** He did.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I did Trombone Shorty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Trombone Shorty goes hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Yeah.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** It's a real thing.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Is it late?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Maybe.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:34]** He might be the most famous professional trombonist right now, like outside of trombone circles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:41]** If you've seen the new Charlie Brown movie... He's a professional trombone player that average people know who he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Right.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** He's huge in funk bands right now.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:48]** If you've seen the new Charlie Brown movie, he is the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** I didn't know that.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** That's really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** He also... Trombone Shorty has a gig for...

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:27]** it's not is it around the horn it's one of those like sports talking head shows he's like the house band but i know that not him but him at trombone shorty and his band are the house band oh so yeah so it's like he's like the lead guy the yeah he's like the md band leader yeah yeah that is cool i've never heard of anyone md'ing from the trombone slot but is it weird that my childhood aspiration was to be a software engineer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:52]** no i think it's weird no yeah it's not weird at all man it's pretty cool i mean uh considering your childhood was was around like primordial soup and you had a concept of software development yeah a little bit yeah there's like so many weirder things you could have wanted to be you know that's true you could have wanted to be like an orthodontist but software engineers way better


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Shout out to all you orthodontists out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:02]** There are more exciting things you could have wanted to be too, but... Who I helped in computer science class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Is he an orthodontist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** He is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Nice.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Dude, awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Appreciate you, Paul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Thanks, Paul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Heath for doing his orthodontics.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Yeah.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** For doing all of ours.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Thanks, Paul.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** That's really great.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** Paul, DDS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Thanks, Paul.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:28]** Paul, proud orthodontic partner of We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:34]** We'll Save Yo' Teeth the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Or Won't Save Yo' Teeth.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Won't Save Yo' Teeth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** He's not a very good orthodontist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** We got a poem.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:48]** We did mention in the last episode that got released that John's character has like four teeth or something.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** So take care of your teeth.

**[00:06:49 - 00:07:18]** well that's also because he uses them for his arcane stuff don't use your teeth as some kind of summoning mechanism or something like that keep them in your face or whatever I mean there's probably a cipher that you could grind up teeth and ingest it and do something with I ground up bare bones and snorted it teeth are for smiles and not spells kids that's a matter of perspective yeah it's true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** I like how you said, like, keep your teeth in your head or whatever.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** I was like, where else are you keeping your teeth, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** In your butt, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** In my pouch that I carry around.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:33]** In my giant bag of jeans now with cargo fucking pockets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** That's what people do now.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** In your JNCO jeans.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:57]** that's all paul wears is ginkgo jeans at the every time he steps just like a gust of wind comes out of his jeans those jeans are so huge like oh my god his chain keeps getting caught on people's braces i don't even know where he practiced or what he does anymore so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:01]** At this point, Paul, I think, is just an off-screen character.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** The fictional Paul.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** He just shows up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I wasn't going to go to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Yeah.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** All right, good.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Yeah, don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** Thanks, Heath.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** I mean, I don't know who the fuck he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** He's okay at computer science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** You wouldn't endorse him on LinkedIn.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** Glowing recommendation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:31]** I think he wanted the AP credits so he could get into dental school, probably at USC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Oh, wait.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** He's had a question that he wanted to bring up.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** I did, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:42]** Well, actually, the Jinko genes is kind of a decent transition to what I wanted to talk about.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:54]** I was thinking about it today before we got on, and I realized... I was like, I guess I have a vague notion in my head that I haven't really actively thought much about of what Ira looks like.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:59]** But then I was like, I don't actually really have an idea of what any of these characters look like.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** It's just like...

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:28]** word association right you just kind of fill in a slot in your mind and then the the ginkgo genes are a good uh transition because like 10 minutes before i got on i was like what does ira look like and and then furthermore like what we're in appalachia in the is it late 1800s early 1920s early 1900s that's even better uh because i was like what would he wear and then i was like

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:37]** Actually, what I'm wearing right now is kind of perfect because I got a Wrangler button-up.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** Show us.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:43]** But I also have the camo cargos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** He's standing on a wheelchair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:46 - 00:10:13]** yeah he just he just totally passed his acrobatics check though yes he did yeah yeah but i was like so i noticed on irish sheet it says somewhere he has fancy clothes and i was like yeah but what are fancy clothes in appalachia in the early 1900s and i googled i was like when were camo pants invented like actual like manufactured camouflage and it was 1915 yeah oh

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:37]** i was like i think ira it's perfect like ira has on his sheet labeled um fancy clothes but that's from ira's perspective it's a denim pearl snap and some camo cargo pants with flip-flops you know yeah i don't think yeah i mean that's from our perspective too uh sandals of some kind you know yeah something yeah

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** But then I also was like, OK, but what does he look like?

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** The man?

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Yeah.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** And you know what popped into my head?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:52]** And I don't know why, but I was like, it fits the the kind of ratty skeeziness of Ira that I've tried to put forward.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** You guys have all seen the Pirates of the Caribbean.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** You know, the guy who has the one eye that keeps coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:26]** yep yeah yeah yeah ira okay that's ira yeah i like that i i had up to this point imagine like uh jeremy allen white but no eyeball pop guy is is ira gonna look it up officially jeremy allen oh okay the bear yeah yeah yeah it kind of looks like uh heath i feel he has like a similar kind of like he looks kind of similar you know like similar eyes and stuff um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** I used to have longer hair like that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Yeah, I could see it.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** And then now you got a fresh fade today.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** There it is.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** Sharp.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Looking sexual.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Sexual.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** If no one has seen Keith's face, just look up Jeremy Allen White.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:46]** And that's the sexiness that has joined our show about six episodes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** That's funny.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** They were all gassing me up about my haircut before we got on.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** And I was like, but in all seriousness, I feel much hotter than I have in a while.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** If you want to follow along at home, the actor's name is Mackenzie Crook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** The Pirates of the Caribbean guy.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Mackenzie Crook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** And I'm not mad at it at all.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** Yeah, I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** I was like, that's iron.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** And I love the image that pops up.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:14]** Not him in the Pirates of the Caribbean, like the actor picture that comes up.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:17]** He's got kind of medium-long hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:40]** hair yeah they're like mustache little goatee combo yeah yep yep the little soul patch uh-huh so i'm gonna put the rest of this cast on the spot because i think that's really cool yeah uh that was the goal whoever wants to go next um what's your character wearing and if they were played by an actor who would they be played by uh

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** I have an idea.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** I'm trying to get his name.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** In no particular order.

**[00:12:46 - 00:13:00]** I will say... Rabbit Rabbit would probably be played by... Be voiced by... See?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:04]** That's tough, because my gut is like Benedict Cumberbatch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Well, okay.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** I'm down for that, I guess.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:36]** but i don't know if he could do like a like a southern accent or do i just leave him british i don't know he he's done it in a movie before yeah he has all right he is he's british oh southern yeah yeah he's very british super british yeah i was like yeah yeah yeah uh i don't think he's good at accents actually but um he can't say i don't think so yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** That's his biggest Achilles heel.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** He cannot say penguin.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** And he got hired to do a documentary about penguins.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** And he mispronounced it numerous different ways the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** There's a YouTube of just all that smashed cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** It's brilliant.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** It's so good.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I need to see those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Do you think they would test for that first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:02]** Nah, they're just like, just get BC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** So Zoa, it just says appropriate clothing, whatever the f*** that means.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** So I'm just going to let go with what I originally thought.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:16]** He reminds me of Radagast the Brown from the Hobbit movie.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** What actor that is, I don't know.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** But that guy looks like he's literally insane, which I think checks out.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** And he lives in the forest and hangs out with birds everywhere.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** It works out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:36]** Sylvester McCoy is the name of the actor, which is actually a pretty good name for a character in Old Gods of Appalachia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Sylvester McCoy.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Fun fact, also from the UK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:44]** Our Appalachian cast is all going to be British.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:50]** We're going to have Christopher Lee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** That's close enough.

**[00:14:54 - 00:15:17]** the appalachian mountains actually don't don't there don't didn't that range split off and some of it's in the uk isn't that correct somewhere or maybe it's just scotland not the uk actually but yeah like at one point they were the same mountain range is like on the other side yeah yeah back in a long time ago times i would have to double check that long time ago yeah like a few hundred million years ago


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:34]** uh for sure yeah so really the colonial expansion of the east coast during that the scottish highlands was the scottish highlands old land from britain yeah exactly well it kind of makes sense but the scottish highlands were apparently the same mountain range


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:58]** which so well actually it's it's more than that it's uh when i just looked it up uh that range when pangea split and it's now the appalachian the atlas mountains in western africa uh the scottish highlands the scandinavian like fjords uh and watkins range in greenland or is that iceland

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Iceland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Greenland.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:04]** I bet there's a great YouTube video that traces that breakup.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** According to this one shit map that I just looked up, it's Greenland.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** We'll see.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Yeah.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Yeah, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** That's spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Cole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** I feel... I feel good.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:34]** so zoe is dressed in tattered robes apparently yeah tattered robes with a weird hat that sort of looks like the russian hat from the 1800s for some reason that's it if like there you go you've got the comrade sorting hat going on comrade sorting hat is a very accurate way to put it

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:58]** uh and like the pseudo dreads yeah and and bird somewhere yeah how often does zoa wash his hair i mean the possums will like groom it for him but their definition of clean is different so that's not like he doesn't own it's not an answer to the question right yeah i guess i guess if you want to say traditional washing then he probably doesn't do that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:01]** I mean, it's early 1900s Appalachia.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:08]** Like, I feel like the one that washes his hair the most is probably Ira, and that's like once every two weeks, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:13]** Ira's such a nice chap to come out and help me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** All right.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:21]** Julius, you've talked about some of your garb already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:35]** Yeah, he wears a suit professionally, and then when he's moving things, he'll take off the jacket, roll up the sleeves, and usually has the tie that sits around the neck of the white shirt.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:49]** And I think he looks... He's young, because he's roughly the same age as y'all, but his eyes are just so... Even not as a ghost, he just doesn't sleep, so he just has a lot of premature aging and wrinkles.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** Yeah.

**[00:17:49 - 00:18:17]** uh just from his like work nights uh just odd hours doesn't sleep a lot and also has the gray right around the ears where it's like starting to go white you know it's like it's like it's like a streak and it's otherwise black but then just clear bands where it's just fantastic uh a bit yeah that's kind of cool yeah yeah that's good yeah i think it's a sexy look i think it's a very dignified look yeah i'm i mean no one could see i'm torn between

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:23]** Well, yeah, now it just looks a little... You can still tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:28]** The apparition still has... You can tell where the little sexy white area is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** I can't out-die my rough living.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** But... What is it?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** The two actors... I'm torn between two actors.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** I'm torn between Cillian Murphy...

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Oh, I like that.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** Especially like Oppenheimer, right?

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** Or another, because he's Irish, right?

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Another Irish actor, Barry Keoghan.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:03]** There's like a little bit of, you know, who's like younger and just has this look about him, this haunted, or is able to really pull that haunted look.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** What's his name again?

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Barry Keoghan.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:06]** Barry Keoghan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** I can't look at him the same after Salt Burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** I know.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** I'll look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:39]** he looks like a guy that would be in Appalachia but I feel like I feel like what's his name the other one you mentioned is a haunting looking guy yeah in a good way so I feel like especially you're kind of a haunting guy now so it makes sense yeah I think Killian Murphy makes a lot of sense I think so too yeah I'm in with that this other guy's nice eyes too though actually in some from something behind us God


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** That's what all of our characters actually sound like with their UK actors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Yeah, they're all.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:49]** Yeah, just go back to our banter on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:50]** Is that?

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Is that why we started there?

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Did we shoot ourselves in the foot?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** We pigeonholed this entire adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** We did.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** Well, it depends on who's playing Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** So Cole's attire.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Woody Harrelson.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** I mean... I fucking love Woody Harrelson.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** He is amazing.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** I do too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:12]** He's a phenomenal person and actor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:22]** Would be an appropriate choice for this, but I was also torn kind of between two actors, but I'll get to that in a sec.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:35]** But I think his clothing is obviously described 1920s appropriate attire, so I'm guessing like denim overalls with a button-down

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:40]** long sleeve shirt, working man type shirt.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Uh, it was like a Paul Bunyan.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Yeah.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** With a wide brim, like straw hat, you know?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:57]** Um, and I was, I was like, man, I, you know, he's like a, uh, a gritty, but not overly gritty, uh,

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:04]** And at first I was thinking, oh, maybe like Josh Brolin, because I just like Josh Brolin.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:10]** But I think more appropriate would be like A Walking Phoenix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** I like Josh Brolin more of the two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Yeah, I think a Gurney Halleck Josh Brolin is...

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Yeah.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Yeah.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** That's a good pick.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** Or even a Thanos Josh Brolin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Yeah, with the purple ball chin and everything, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** With the Yeezys on his chin, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** He does look like he has a scrotum for a chin.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** It's, like, very interesting.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** I hated that portrayal of Thanos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** Straight up copied Men in Black with the ball chinions, you know?

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:39 - 00:22:00]** oh my goodness well guys thank you for that uh revelation about each of your characters this is this is really cool i'm gonna keep every bit of this in mind as we step call up hollywood get it done you need to start casting your npcs too

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Oh, man.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** I already did one.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** That's true.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** I'll figure out who would play the rest of them in a bit.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** For now, let's get back into the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Nah, one more thing.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:18]** The possums have to be, like, bad CGI, like the Cats musical remake.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Don't do that to them.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Oh, no.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** They're people.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** Oh, no.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:30]** Speaking of, like, British actors, we'd have, like, that one guy that everyone hates, that f***ing host that was in that.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** I can't remember his name.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** James Corden.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Yeah, James Corden.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** It's like a possum right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** James Gordon is Cletus, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** No, don't do that to Cletus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** I'll see him at Bottega Louie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Really?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Just kidding.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:47]** I don't know what that is, but Cletus has to be at least an A-lister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:52]** I feel like Cletus is like Sylvester Stallone, because we talked about his backstory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Cletus is an A-lister?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:23]** iris not even an a-lister sylvester stallone is spectacular yeah that's the that's the obvious casting choice or um uh michael b jordan oh yes yes done which is doing anybody in a rocky movie i mean rocky black panther yeah yeah um is that what was the what was the spy movie he was in

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:42]** i thought i thought he was in a tom clancy movie he was i figured it was anyway i'll find it uh and i'll say even i'll shout it right honestly and this is weird uh him in the state farm snl sketch oh yeah it was just like creepy as but also like

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** Yeah, I f*** with Michael B. Jordan.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Michael B. Jordan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Take all the shots.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** You lose all the shots you don't take.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** And obviously not Michael B. Jordan.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** But I didn't know who this person was.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** And today I found out.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** So thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Nice.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** You quoting Wayne Gretzky referring to Michael B. Jordan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** I thought that was Michael Jordan, the basketball player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:12]** No, you miss out 100% of the shots you don't take is a quote from Wayne Gretzky attributed to Michael Scott.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Oh, I thought it was attributed to Michael Jordan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Wait, who's who anymore?

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** What's happening?

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** All right.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Kelly did miss that shot, though.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** He did.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** He took it, but he didn't miss it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** I'm just going to keep taking it.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** I don't know if he missed the net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:30]** You also missed some of the shots you do take down, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** You do miss being embarrassed.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Oh, ****.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Okay, let's get back into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Yeah.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** Whew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Before we get back into it, now I'm just kidding.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Jesus Christ.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** I also have one more thing to add.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** I think I misspoke when I said Bottega Louie.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** It was Balthazar that he got banned from.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** James Gordon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Treating restaurant people bad.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Go ahead, Kelly.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** He just treats everyone bad.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** That's all I'm going to say.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** That's it.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** So I'm going to cast you as the least cool possum.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** All right.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Okay.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** I'm done.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:13]** Benny's waiting for anything else after this very long banter.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** It's going to be like five minutes of playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** Can you talk about how good Benny looks in his polo?

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** His arms just like bulging out of his polo right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Yeah, he looks good.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** I think he's wearing a V-neck.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Is it a polo or a V-neck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:27]** Oh, I missed that shot, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** That's another shot.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** It's fine.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Just forget it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Those gene codes are weighing you down, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:38]** The skinny genes are cutting off blood flow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** It wasn't Bottega Louie.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** It was Little Dom's and Los Feliz.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** He was also there in front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** Oh, I guess we're getting in one episode today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** That's fine.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** That's a shame because Little Dom's is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** I don't know what minute we're on.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** I would like to formally apologize for every time I've derailed starting a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:00]** I'm going to love this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** It happens, dude.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Finder is going to love this episode.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** I hear that and I appreciate you saying that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:12]** Jeremy, I hope you're listening and I hope you listen to all 30 minutes of that intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** It's going to be the best.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:34]** Previously on the Old Gods, Ira turned into a bear, jumps snout first into the water to rescue Cole Ward, who in the last episode had been drawn under by a very angry Maelstrom.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** Maelstrom.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Maelstrom.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** I don't know how to ask ChadGBT.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** It was a maelstrom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:49]** I was trying to think of a P word for drum and it didn't come.

**[00:26:52 - 00:27:03]** Julius and Zoa decide that words are the best weapons to use here and manage to convince this river that they were friends and not foes.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:23]** After calming that situation, you were able to find drag marks in a path to this old abandoned mine where you were attacked by ghostly apparitions in some sort of mining leadership garb.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:48]** you were able to fell finally one of them but the other managed to get away as you made your way down the rest of the mine led in no small part by Ira in his bear form using his bear vision to see down this bear cave with his bear eyes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** And his bare a**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Yeah.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** We're just like in between the cheeks of his bare a** hugging very tightly as we go into this cave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** And we still get attacked.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** You happen across an opening at the end of the cave.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** At the end of the tunnel that you're walking down.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:18]** And you see in this opening a flickering lamp light and a slight just past middle-aged woman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:57]** It's a bit... I can just see a form, and I'm like... This is going to be really embarrassing for you guys.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:58]** Ooh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** 19.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Okay.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Ira?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** That shot I made... Still a bear?

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** Yeah.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Does he get a bonus because he's a bear?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Think about it, you know?

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** To intelligence?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** I don't think so.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Never mind.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** I thought it was vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Oh, s***.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** Another shot missed.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Four.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** As a bear, I rolled a four.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Wow.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** We're just warming up.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** We're just warming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Four, three, six, and 19.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** What's our marching order?

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** I'm behind the bear.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** I'm behind Cole.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Then his ass.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** Then whomever.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Cole.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Yeah.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** And then Zoe, I think.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** And then Julie.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** Julie's just sitting on a bear because he can sit anywhere now because he's a ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Nah, I'm in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** That's why I can't see.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** I can't see anything there.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** What does Zoa see with a 19-year-old?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:53]** You recognize her as... You've seen her around.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** She's kind of the little old lady that keeps to herself.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:02]** She's not unkind, but she's not associating with other people very often.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** You've seen her around town a lot.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** You didn't know she was the watermainder.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** I'm assuming she is now.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:36]** oh she because she uh um as you walk into the clearing what the okay sorry my notes app just like died and then brought itself back much like our friend julie is here um so you would have seen uh her going around town you would know her as miss mary joe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Miss Mary Jo?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** That's Miss Mary Jo, I think.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Is she the watermander?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** I don't know if I've seen the watermander before now that I think of it.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:55]** And as the four of you walk in, she looks right at you, Julius, and says...

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:59]** I remember you from when you were young and looks around at the group.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:08]** And she turns back to you and sort of nods and says, you're the one who died and who lived again.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** And then you see a light bulb flick on in her mind.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Now I understand.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** Rabbit, Rabbit has sent you all to pay your owe.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** He always was the cleverest among us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Now, Miss Mary Jo.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** Yes, there, Julius.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** What are those?

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Yeah.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** Why are we finding you here in this cave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** You see her countenance darken.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:48]** And in a few of the flickers of the lamplight behind her, you can see her wrists are bound.

**[00:31:50 - 00:32:13]** um they appear to be bound um you can see her wrists are bound and she's also kind of wrapped up in what could be like a like a small blanket but it's like leathery straight check not not uh it's not like shaped like that like you could think of it as like sheets um

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:34]** um instead of like a like a purpose-made textile um but this is like it's leathery but it's very clearly not like cow's leather it's not like any leather that you've seen before people leather yeah face um whoa

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Oh.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** It was that f***ed Karn.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** Grabbed me out of my house and brought me here.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** Don't you go messing with him now.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** He's bad news.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** She shudders.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Is he here?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Why did he take you?

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** He was here.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** He was trying to get me to convince the river to stop messing with his people.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:58]** He's from that Langley Coal and Mining group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:02]** Well, we have a plan to...

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Stop them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Oh, you do?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:12]** Well, I think I could probably help you along with that, but these bindings are pretty tight.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I almost wanted to say sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** Is there a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:21]** Can I, yeah, like, I have worked with her or seen her working with my parents.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:28]** Can I do another intellect check to try and see if this is the Miss Mary Jo Watermander that I remember?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Uh, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** You love her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** Yeah.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** She is the water baiter.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Okay.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** See, John, that's how it is.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:44]** When sense motives or things like that get rolled, you get answers like that.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** You know what I mean?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** That answer your question.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** I just want to take this moment to applaud Vinny for a very good response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** I always give you an answer.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** I always give you an answer, Kelly.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** There's always an answer that lets you know what's going on.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Really?

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Is that what that is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:04]** There's the question we want answered, and then there's the third question that John answers for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:08]** Yeah, there's another question that just comes in somehow, and then we get an answer to that.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** He went jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** It's people leather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** Yeah.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:21]** That leather seems very genuine, and so does... It genuinely came off the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** While I was alive.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Or three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Are these your teeth?

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** They are in my possession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** They are now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** All right.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** I think this is her.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** And Julius is going to walk over and start to, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:57]** review and see what he needs to do to take the manacles off um so as you look closer give me a an understanding magic roll oh i'm specialized okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** Something, I'm too trusting.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** I see her being in trouble.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:11]** Maybe the memories of being alive and corporeal are too familiar for me.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** And I'm used to seeing her, bringing her food, talking to her about things.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** I just walk over because I rolled a four.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** So I'm not, if there's any magic, I'm not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** You're not getting it.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:40]** So you walk over and you grab like you try to grab at the end of one of these bands of like leather and you can't find an end to start from.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:45]** And so she responds, you're barking up the wrong tree there, Julius.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** You always were quick, but I guess not today.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:58]** The yarn has bound me here, and these binds are binding not just my body, but also my magic.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Now, that's the bad news.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** The good news is...

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Whoa.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:18]** Ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** I mean, I think so.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** I'll do what I can.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:31]** We also have that mushroom that we can use to break magical restraints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** What was it called again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** You brought one of those death cap mushrooms here?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** We did.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Well.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** You're one smart cookie there, Julius LeGrand.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I need that.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** You've never said that to me before, your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Lies, you have lies.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** You just, like, point and then, like, back up slowly.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:53 - 00:37:02]** I have been a bear in this room the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Just like the bear huff.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** Oh, you just chuffed very sweetly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** I just love how unfazed she was by there being a bear in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** She's probably not the weirdest thing she's seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Clearly when she says us.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:24]** The smartest among us.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** As in Rabbit Rabbit.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Yeah.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** It's a little unnerving.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** What kind of devil's bargain are we about to undertake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:39]** But this is the Miss Mary Jo Waterman that I remember, Cole, I do.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** I can't deny that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:47]** Oh, well, do the mushrooms help with these here magical restraints?

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** Is that what's happening now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** That's a... Well, when I... That's a...

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** That's a pretty smart thing to do.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:58]** I don't know how you knew about these, but that's one of the three things we need to break this bind.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** What other things do we have to do?

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** It's like a Skyrim quest or something.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:11]** Julius, in my pocket over there, and she kind of gestures toward her shoulder like a chest pocket, there's a deck of conjure cards in there.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** It's not...

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:19]** It's not quite all of them because I couldn't grab all of them in my haste to getting dragged out of my house, you see.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:28]** And so that deck and are you going to like grab the would you grab those for me, Julius?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Not a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:54]** i i'm just gonna keep rolling over this four because he doesn't he's he's in too deep on trusting her he's talked to he's like defended cole's you know against cole's like i'm apprehensions you know so i think he's gonna be like yeah of course reach over get the kind of reach through her and pull lift up the car yeah rude


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:10]** I just imagined Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber, the daydream scene where he rips the heart out and pulls it out, still beating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** So you pull out the deck of cards.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** She's like, yeah, would you count those?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** There's supposed to be six in that deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** Didn't we bring one or two of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** And you count, and there's only five.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Two, three.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:53]** um i believe ira murphy has the sixth yeah ira make make an intelligence check ira bear uh 15 okay so yeah you recognize with that that the the um cipher that you got from her house is the sixth card oh okay yeah yeah i've got the conjure card

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** But you're a bear right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** I am.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:07]** I imagine all of my clothes and possessions are part of the bear right now.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** I surely don't have that.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:13]** I think we had 20 minutes left on the bear in the last episode.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Probably down to about 10 minutes left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** You can turn back at any time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** I can.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** I just thought I had to be one for an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:44]** um yeah let's see you ingest it you move like a bear you gain two don't rely especially after about an hour about an hour you return okay okay but i will i will rule that you can turn back into an air uh i mean it's been about an hour you know yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** I love that.

**[00:40:45 - 00:41:02]** So then, like, as soon as she, like, calls him out on it, the just, like, bear ticking clock, like, strikes zero and he anamorphs back into a person holding up the card, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** That is pretty sick.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Good thing we can always count on Ira to steal.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** It's going to be really useful today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:15]** I want an Animorphs cover that is Ira transforming into a bear.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** I need that cover.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** That would be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** Somebody in one of our communities can make that happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Yep.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** Oh, what's your...

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Jeans shirt.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** A bear and camo pants.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Jeans shirt.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** It's this shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Yeah.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Yep.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** Wrangling.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Yeah.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:49]** Well, this is the sixth one, and he pulls it from Ira's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** My goodness.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:53]** Ira, you... Those sticky fingers of yours are always getting in stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:13]** we thought you might be dead yeah you might not be wrong yet i thought i might need it to rescue you you know sure and she winks at you she knows your gig um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Yeah, wouldn't you also be somewhat familiar?

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** Because I know you're interested in magic, but have you talked to the watermander before?

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Have you learned from her before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:30]** I think we discussed that he had probably... So Ira's thing is he's fascinated by and interested in magic.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** but has an inability in it, right?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:39]** Like he's good at like herbalism and sleight of hand and stuff like that.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** And he wants nothing more than to be proficient in magic.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:49]** So I think the way we kind of described it is he had probably pestered her and like hung around and been like, show me some stuff, you know?

**[00:42:50 - 00:43:00]** And so they've got some kind of like antagonistic, but pseudo friendly relationship, but he never like was able to learn anything from her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:21]** as far as doing magic yeah so um she hands you that and the third thing we need is a memory something shared by at least three of you if you can think of something awesome if not i'll give you a couple minutes to um you know come up with one like how like what do you mean


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:26]** Like, is she going to siphon the memory out of our heads and we won't have it anymore?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Or like Harry Potter style?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Can we ask me?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Are you asking her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:36]** Are you going to siphon this memory out of our heads and it will be gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Why does the memory require it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** I don't make the magical rules.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Those are above my pay grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** What I do know is... Will I remember Julie's dying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:52]** This memory would be consumed by the spell to break these binds.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** And so it's something that... Will we not remember it?

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** You won't remember after this.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Oh, s***.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** Well, it could be useful to remember the... Man, that's probably not a good one to sacrifice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Well, if it's at least three of you, then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Do you need it from all four of us?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Not necessarily.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** The rules just say three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:16]** Y'all remember when y'all had to get me out of jail that one time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** The third time I got caught stealing?

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** We were all in the cellar of the

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:28]** In the bootlegger's office, that seemed inconsequential at the time.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:33]** Perhaps that would serve as a fond enough memory of us drinking.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:36]** I mean, we almost didn't remember anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:40]** Well, that's how you got those camouflage pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Oh, that is true.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:48]** Have you all decided which memory we're going to sacrifice for this ritual?

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** I could...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** I could forget that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** I mean, I almost forgot it already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:56]** Let's try to remember this real quick so we can sacrifice that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** That's decent enough.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** Julius, would you take those cards and put them face down in a circle?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Okay.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Would you hand me that?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** That might be careful not to touch it with your bare skin.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** It'll hurt you.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** Would you just put it in my hands real gently?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** But it's all right for it to touch your bare hands?

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** He empties out the bag.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:26]** And you, like, you can see that she flinches when, when it hits her hands, but it's just like a necessary part of the, of the spell.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Yeah.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Right.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Yeah.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** All right.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:35]** Everyone who's, you know, was there for the memory, step inside the circle and start, start sharing that memory.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** If you don't mind.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** I'm sorry.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Let me make the circle a little bigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** I thought this is too small for three people.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Sorry.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Why?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** It's a circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Ira steps in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:54]** I remember having one, two minute drinks, talking to Julius, making the whole crowd nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:05]** I remember that Ira got those camo pants off of a deceased body that was shoved in that basement we were hiding out in.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I remember that much.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** I washed them.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** You did not wash them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Julius, you don't have to share, do you?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** After


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:23]** Well, the thing is that we had to make some concessions because that was going to be the pants that the deceased was buried in to a certain degree, you know.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** We had to find something else very quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Basically.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:33]** Well, I feel like the ones that we gave him were very inappropriate.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** There was no butt flap on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:45]** And we had to, I mean, they were styled after some, this is why we were making, which I never heard of until this is why we were making people nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:55]** We, we retcon in a situation where Iris stole some dude's pants and they had to bury him shirt cocking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:00]** What does Shercock mean?

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:03]** I thought that we were talking about it together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** I'm going to look that up in my dictionary here.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** You just have a dictionary with you?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** He's looking up the rules for bullshit.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** For this spell.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Yeah, he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:44]** i thought that we were talking about how we were recounting this story together in a bar too yeah that's yeah yeah so we and that's why i was making people nervous and then julius us talking to a ghost was making people nervous you know what i love about i thought this was when we were alive google ai i asked it like what it means and it's just said this practice is frowned upon as burning man even though full nudity is encouraged but apparently a man who wears a shirt without pants or underwear that makes sense um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:46 - 00:48:04]** so you can't winnie the pooh but you can be a seven-year-old basically that's dumb okay that's the reason why you can it's just frowned upon it's just frowned right but like to do something frowned upon at burning man seems pretty extreme right yeah i know like any burners out there yeah

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:26]** uh yeah i don't want to go i mean that's usually how i'm on the podcast just a t-shirt nothing else um same the so you as you guys finish telling this sharing this memory um among the four of you out loud uh and making it up from your past because it's definitely something we haven't explored yet um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** I tried to share something genuine.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** It's funny that we don't have this.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** I just want the record to reflect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** That's fine.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** She says, alright, there's the memory.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** I've got this paste.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** Now, who wants to try to break this bind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** I'm not very magically inclined.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Anyone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:54]** Neither am I. Perhaps to break it, you might need to be physically strong.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** That could be you, Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:27]** okay here goes nothing what does it do you uh give me a using magic roll yeah this is a using you want me to use magic yeah i i mean i just checked all four of your character sheets and you're all have an inability in using magic so it's all suck at it yeah yeah yeah uh i mean i think like i would try it because he wants to uh got it then whoa yo he is the chosen one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:31]** I was immediately just insanely jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** This is spectacular.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:40]** This is exactly how this should have happened.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:48]** Cole Ward channels not his magical prowess, but his focus.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** On defending what matters.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Yeah.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:58]** And there's no inability that could stand in his way when it comes down to defending what matters.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:58]** Nice.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Cole stands in that circle.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** You can put your mind.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:08]** He eats that mushroom paste and takes no damage from it.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:12]** Cause his testicles are that big.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:19]** Um, and as he consumes it, you see like a gentle glow start to emanate from his person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** It's like Josh went in out of range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:41]** And the radiation off of him, like the glow and the energy coming off of him, like you see the binds and the leather wrappings around her start to disintegrate and turn to dust.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:48]** Almost as if there's a time lapse on those bits of leather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** Like Josh Brolin with the Infinity Gauntlet.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:00]** Just turn everything into a Josh Brolin reference.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:07]** And from behind you... Cole Ward says, hmm, like Josh Brolin in No Country for Old Men.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** What happened?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** And from behind you, you hear a voice.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** Don't hear him.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** I see we are not alone now.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** I see we are not alone.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Quick, turn back into a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Cool, yeah, bear time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** Turn back into a bear.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:33]** He sat there and watched his clock waiting on bear time to run out.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** Go Go Bear Cocaine.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Please.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Cocaine Bear.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** Go Go Bear Cocaine.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** We missed an opportunity to make Cocaine Bear happen in this show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** We did.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** I mean, it's pretty plentiful in the 20s, wasn't it?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** It was before anybody really cracked down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** I mean, it was in Coca-Cola, I'm sure.
