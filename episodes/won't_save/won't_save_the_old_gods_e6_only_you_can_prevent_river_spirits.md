## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:18]** Hello, family.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:23]** Gather round and let me tell y'all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:31]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollows and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale has yet to be told.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:35]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:45]** Pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode, and beneath these mountains ancient, eldritch beings lie imprisoned, their presence a dark whisper in the wind.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:52]** Hanks and boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck, or just right for the picking.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** In these woods, the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night.

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:05]** Welcome to Wantsafe, where the only certainty is the mountain's grip, as unyielding as the fear it instills.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:14]** Well, hello there, family.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:18]** My name is Vinny Rodriguez, and I am your very, very wet GM.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:25]** Joined here by Will Garrett, Kelly Gilliam, Heath Parker, and John Swan.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** And this is Won't Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** It's very misty in here.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** I think I caught the vapors.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** The podcast.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:35]** I also got wet whenever I hear Vinny speak.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** I get moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Oh, Denny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:40 - 00:02:00]** just gonna leave it alone let's do it i'm gonna leave it like a minute of silence after that after you say that just a really awkward noise jesus heath is just looking at us now like these are i'm sitting next to a humidifier so like i'm very slightly moist as well okay cool

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** You pull out a handkerchief.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Start dabbing.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** Dab in the neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:10]** Like a courtroom lawyer in a movie from the 50s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Amazing.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** You know, we're here playing a game.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** In this game, we are kind of fighting against the elements here.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:30]** And so I did want to take a moment and talk about something that happened this week when we were recording, or the week before we started recording, Hurricane Helene.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:40]** Uh, passed through, uh, my ethical woods in Florida, went on to, uh, dump a whole bunch of water in Appalachia, the source material for this game that we get to play.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:45]** And so, um, just wanted to, to kind of address the elephant in the room.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:50]** You know, we are thinking of everyone in that area that's, you know, sort of had, uh,

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:06]** this thrust upon them you know we're here to play a game and to have fun doing these things but what they're going through is something very real and very disastrous for them so our thoughts and our prayers um on the podcast go out to everyone that's been affected by hurricane helene


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:21]** today what we do is in honor of you so we're gonna we're gonna fuck some shit up on your behalf and we hope you're doing well and being safe and your family and your homes are okay or we'll come back even stronger than before yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:27]** You can do your own research on who to donate to if you feel called to donate to disaster causes.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:35]** I'm a fan of the Red Cross, but that's my personal choice.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:46]** I encourage anyone and everyone to do research on a charitable donation and make what gift you think is appropriate to help people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** Yeah, you could do Red Cross, Salvation Army, United Way.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** All of them are helping with Helene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Give where you can.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Pray to whatever deity it is you pray to.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** Keep these people in your thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Don't pray to the old gods because it might affect the story.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, don't.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** That was the one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** Cool.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Let's, let's lighten this up a little bit.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** Um, I've got a fun banter question for you guys.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Okay.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** Choose one.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** You got to choose one.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:30]** You either get a book made of chocolate, like printed, you can read it, do whatever, or toilet paper made of cotton candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** Uh, chocolate's going to be within like three seconds.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** It's just going to melt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Yeah, but it's just chocolate, Dan.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Then you just have a bunch of candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Yeah, I want to be able to read the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:51]** Is this book by any way endued with the magical property in which if I were to eat the page, I absorb that knowledge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** Um, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** What is the corollary?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:02]** What do you gain from the cotton candy if you wipe your butt with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** Does it smell like roses for life?

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Or cotton candy for life?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Yes.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** That's a tough question now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** Because it depends on the book, too.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:16]** What if this is the life work of Charles Schultz?

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** You just know everything about peanuts now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** It's not worth it.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** That would be the life work of George Washington Carver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:32]** I'll take the cotton candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:58]** i'm going with that to smell like roses right but if it's like marcus aurelius meditations or like the art of war how about like the encyclopedia britannica right that's the that would be good but that's the that's the bang for your buck pick right there but you only get one volume one volume and that's still so much single letter but it's like from the 70s you know i'm saying so it's way out of date


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** That's still good, though.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Some of it.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Not all of it.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Some of it.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** That's true.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** That's true.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** I'm still going to book, man.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:16]** Like, the thing is, I feel like this is like a genie thing where it's like whichever one you pick, the person setting this up is like, I'm going to find a way to twist your words and make this stupid, you know?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** So, like, the cotton candy thing is like, oh, your butt smells good, but the poop coming out of it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Yeah, I feel like it would also apply to the poop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** It makes your poop not stink?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** Literally, it doesn't stink?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:33]** Would you eventually grow to just hate the smell of cotton candy like you hate the smell of poop now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Probably not as bad.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** You'd get sick of it, but it wouldn't be as extreme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** At what point do you taste it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** That's why I'm picking the book.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** I don't want to be tempted.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** You don't want to be tempted.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** I agree with this.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** That's fair.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** I'm going to go with a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:53 - 00:07:02]** Even if it's one letter of an outdated volume, there's still such an enormous amount of knowledge that you get from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** From the encyclopedia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** Yeah, from one letter of the encyclopedia.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Just pick the biggest letter.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** Pick S. That thing's this thick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Yeah, but you'd have to eat the whole book, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** Is it like an in-one-sitting thing?

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Yeah, you can't put it in the fridge.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Yeah, dude, you freeze it, man.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** Yeah.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Wait, I don't put candy in the fridge sometimes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, you should, you should.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** I was under the impression that, like, you would get the toilet paper for life.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** That's not a thing.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** So it's not like a subscription to either of these things.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]** You don't get, like, a subscription to the Chocolate Encyclopedia Britannica, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** No, it's like one volume or one roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** Well, in that case, I probably would go with the book too.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** I was thinking there would always be toilet paper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Always cotton candy.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Like how sticky would your fingers be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** Cotton candy would be a horrible toilet paper is the thing.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** It just dissolves and then you got candy butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Yeah.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:58]** How do you turn a chocolate page without it just like falling apart?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:20]** it depends on the book you said it was a functioning book but like you know you could do like the largest book in the world which is you know five meters by eight meters tall oh yeah there's some like enormous bibles out there how long would it take to eat five meters by eight meters


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:47]** probably the rest of your life you you would need like a huge walk-in freezer like a whole whole warehouse keep that thing cold and then you open yourself up to theft like uh yeah if you take a bite like a cross-section of the book do you like have a mental breakdown because you've now consumed like just parts of random sentences yeah what is the unit of knowledge that you're consuming is it like a letter and a sentence that's the thing you know

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** I think you get the world's largest book.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** You put it in a warehouse.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** You hire guards to watch over it.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:58]** Then you start to build out the one warehouse into a complex to store other valuable things.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** And then you just become a villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** You got to worry about, I mean, the chocolate's going to go bad, right?

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Does it go?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** Is it like always preserved?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:29]** it's a freezer it's a giant you know yeah like it's gross but it won't kill you yeah but like if if it is eaten by insects are those insects now consumers of that knowledge like the ants are like extremely knowledgeable on like greek like history yeah right that would be like annoying good form like phalanxes and go against i would not be for that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I feel like you've got to hermetically seal it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:41]** This would be on a timer for sure, because if you seal it up tight in a freezer bag, you can refrigerate chocolate for up to a year, which is a good amount of time.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** But if you're talking about that big of a book, are you going to get it done?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:48]** You can freeze it for up to 18 months for best quality.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** It probably won't kill you forever.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** Another year after that, you know?

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Two and a half years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Two and a half years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** You could do it.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:04]** You get yourself a copy of... A chocolate copy of Artimedes, Cyrus the Great.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:11]** And you consume all, you know, 13,000 plus pages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** It's a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** And then you just become...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:37]** you know what the world's foremost authority like greek romanticism basically you become will that's what you do yeah yeah that's how will got to be who he is that's that's because he wrote it yeah yeah he does oh my god you also have to consider that weird thing that a guard

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** Or, you know, somebody in your family who knows about it might start eating as well.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** And then you would miss information.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** And what if they eat very important information?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Then they start to challenge you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:53]** I would rather than have one big book that you get all the knowledge of at once, once you finish it.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Like, I'm working on finishing another degree.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** Like, every semester, let me get one of my textbooks in chocolate form.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:07]** And I will eat it over the course of like a week because a textbook is a lot, but not that much.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** I'll eat it in like a week and then I won't have to study for the whole semester.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** Do you still have to show up to get credit for the class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I'm in online classes, baby.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** I don't got to show up anyway.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** See, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** That's the plan.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:26]** See, I feel like the quality of the chocolate and the flavor of the chocolate is directly related to the quality of the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:34]** So dark chocolate obviously being, you know, do you get to pick the kind of chocolate, like where it comes from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** Well, I think it's in the perception of the consumer.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:44]** So if it's an accounting textbook, it's going to taste like eating f***ing chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Like whatever your least favorite chocolate is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** Like Dollar Tree, really s***y chocolate.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:58]** But if it's the latest whodunit, it's going to taste like Ghirardelli.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:03]** I would like my chocolate to be from Libgate Farms in Kauai.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** And that's an endorsement of that chocolate, too.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** I want everything.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** That's freaking amazing, by the way.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Also, it's real chocolate, not fake chocolate like you mostly get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** I think we'll just send out our pitch deck to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:17]** I really want them to sponsor our show.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Why not?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** They definitely need it as a small private farm on Kauai that does tours.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** On the island, yeah.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** On the island of Kauai.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:46]** i bet that's exactly what the uh old gods of appalachia role-playing game handbook tastes like because this has been an absolutely delightful read nailed it nailed it whatever chocolate is like terrifying is what it would be and i don't know what that would be like things that shouldn't be habanero chocolate


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:46 - 00:13:04]** yeah yeah i think just hershey's well i feel like it's hershey's is garbage it's it's gonna be like boutique habanero but like super espresso lace because it just like gets your heart going and then like has a kick of like ghost pepper yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:09]** Are you guys like, I'm still like, it was nice getting to meet you guys at Gen Con and now getting to know you more.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** Are you guys as a group like foodies in general?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Yeah.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** I just didn't know, you know, until today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** Let me ask you a question.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** Oh, no.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Aren't we all foodies in a way?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Like if you're human?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:27]** Yeah, I mean, that's not what the term foodie means, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** No, but, I mean, we all are interested in food, right?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** To varying degrees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** To varying degrees, for sure.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** I mean, some people are interested in so far as it will keep them alive, and that's about it.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:43]** I'm not one of those people, but some people are pragmatic like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** That is not the targeted audience of our kawaii chocolate spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** No, it isn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Cool.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** We are that.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** We talk about that a lot.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** We do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** I'm not saying that you're a bunch of weirdos.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** I worked in restaurants for years and years.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I love food, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:26]** yeah it's just like 10 minutes into a banter about chocolate he's just like all right like i didn't i'm recognizing some things that i didn't previously you know just think about if you're uh if white pizza is pizza and we'll talk about that next week that's it no no i don't want to have that conversation again and just tell us all again it is all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** I'll message you.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** Every episode, Heath regrets saying yes a little bit more.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** No, I don't.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:38]** Not at all.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** Heath, what is tucked inside of your hat, by the way?

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Is that like one of your jewels or something?


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** It's a pencil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** It's a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:52]** It's actually my very fancy pen that I won as a teacher gift raffle last year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** That's a nice pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:59]** It's got a little wooden box that it came in.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** It's an arrow.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** It's a display pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Yeah.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Oh, and it has the name of my school engraved in it.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** I didn't realize that until right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** You actually just reminded me that I had to make a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:16]** Um, it doesn't say on the pin, maybe on the box.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** I'll get back to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Okay.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Uh, no, thank you Heath for that reminder.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** Cause I had everything but a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** You're welcome.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** I went to reach for a pen on my desk.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** And in fact, it was a chopstick.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** It was a big pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:36]** Well, if you're dedicated enough and have an inkwell, that too can be a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** You're absolutely right.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** Should we get started?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Is the transition of the week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:52]** I got a new spinner for my rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Ooh, look at that.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Fancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** That is nice.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** Fancy pants, Rich McGee over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** All right, I'm cueing the off banter music, Benny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** If we don't get started soon, I'm going to toot a little away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** Previously on Won't Save.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:18]** We happen to cross the Possum Palace, only to find it taking on water.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:28]** However, Julius and Zoe are able to jump in and rescue Cletus, the rather precocious possum, from...

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** Inescapable doom and destruction.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:39]** From there, we push on through the woods to the watermander's place to discover the river going absolutely crazy.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:45]** As you try to cautiously approach the watermander's place.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** Huzzah!

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Attack!

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:55]** You're attacked by the river, who is incredibly upset for a reason that it has hinted at, but we have not yet quite ascertained.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:01]** You push through the docks to get into the watermander's place sitting on stilts above the river.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:05]** As she is kind of the river's keeper, the river's friend.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:09]** And so you make it in, you find some fun things.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** You find some ciphers.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:17]** The three of you that succeeded on your intelligence roles got to add ciphers to your collections.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** And so...

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:25]** Something I want you guys to think about is your cipher count.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:29]** You have a maximum amount of ciphers that you can carry on your person.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** And so think about what you're going to take with you, what you're going to leave here.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** What was the one that I got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** It was the charm of revelation level four.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Yeah, the charm of reversal.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Charm of reversal.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Yeah, that's a good one.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** Can I just use that right now?

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** What does it do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:46 - 00:18:11]** um you wear it the next time you're attacked the charm protects you from the damage and attempts to afflict it back on your attacker instead it's probably too late to wreck on it yeah definitely to wreck on it instead of getting rid of a cipher could i just use one now you could to free up the space yeah you could use technically speaking you could use one and then pick up the next one okay which one did you want to use


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:28]** I think that's the most fun and ridiculous option, because ironically, the cipher that single-handedly made me pick Ira as the pre-gen I wanted to play was Beast Shape, because I assume it turned me into a bear, and then I could fight like a bear.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:32]** But it turns you into a bear, but you don't really get any attack benefits.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** It's just like, you're good at climbing now, you know?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:40]** Well, it's like, you're good at climbing, and you get assets on a couple of skill checks, right?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** Yeah.

**[00:18:40 - 00:19:03]** yeah so surely you can battle as a bear though you must have but there's no specific damage associated with it you know it doesn't have its separate damage role uh so i'm not as impressed as i was with it but i do think it would be hilarious for ira to be a bear for this whole episode does anybody else know that you can turn into a bear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Or is this just like a surprise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** No one has ever seen me turn into a bear.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** I don't think I've used this cipher before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:16]** And it's surely like Ira is a man driven by greed and almost nothing else.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Right.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** So it's like, oh, I'm not getting rid of one of these ciphers.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Guess I'll be a bear now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** Quick question.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** And I'll be more intimidating that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Yeah.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** You know, our ciphers one time use.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Yeah.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** That's what I thought.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:36]** So, yeah, I mean, like, Ira turns to the guys and is like, hey, I got this.

**[00:19:37 - 00:20:01]** real damn cool conjure card that i think will be really useful when we need it and i'm not getting rid of it so i'm gonna ask that you guys one as i'm don't be don't be freaked out and two do not attack me i'm gonna i'm gonna need you guys to get real cool about a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Go ahead.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** I am fine with that, but Cole is in the water right now.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** So if whatever you're about to do can help Cole, then that is what we need to happen.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** That needs to happen immediately right now because I cannot jump in.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Zoa, can you jump in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** It must have been a torrent of water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:21]** No, and my possums are not here with me, and they're very water-friendly.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:24]** Unfortunately, by myself, I'm not very useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:37]** Actually, I think being a bear might be kind of useful in that situation because bears are stronger than Ira, so I could jump in the water and get him and bear strength pull him to shore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** I agree with that.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** I think so.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** They're often in rivers anyway, getting fish and shit.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Yeah.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** He's like, all right, I'm going to go get him.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:49]** And you see him pull out a little container of dust.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** It's a...

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** It's ground bear bones.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:59]** And he pulls it out and knocks it out onto his hand and snorts it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Wails it.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** This is excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** And then morphs into a fully grown bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** What kind of bear?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** Well, I've seen some things, but I've never seen that kind of thing.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** I mean, I'm a ghost, but he's turned into a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** I'm going to make a name for myself today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** I think being a bear would come in the end.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:28]** I feel like the doc starts to creak a little bit just under the weight of you becoming a fully mature bear.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** And we're like, oh, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** Is this bear like...

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:51]** the your clothes melt into the fur or is this like hulk bear where like you're a bear but you're wearing pants and they're tattered and like uh that's i would imagine that's up to gm discretion but i was assuming it was more of an anamorph situation i'm good with it i it's your cipher we're gonna make it what you want it to be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:52 - 00:22:05]** the clothes morph into the fur you know and so he morphs into a fucking grizzly bear like right in front of you guys awesome

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** And then, I'm assuming I can't talk like a person now that I'm a bear.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Nope.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:15]** So he just kind of... And goes, and I'm going to leap off the bridge and try to go get my friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:23]** As you leap off, Julius is going to use his encouragement and is going to encourage you, Ira, and say...

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:28]** Keep your wits about you and just pull that man to shore and get him safe.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:39]** So you will have a benefit to, I would say, whatever skill you're going to use to pull him in that you're trained or specialized in or tasked with any skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:43]** I mean, I'm not trained in anything that has anything to do with strength.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** I was just betting on being a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Would that still apply, Vinny?

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Maybe it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:51 - 00:23:03]** I think you ease one of the following tasks, defense, attack, or related to any skill that you yourself are trained or specialized in, which I don't see anything special.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Yeah, speed defense.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** You're right.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Climbing.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I am trained in climbing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** You could give him some climbing encouragement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Okay.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** In case you need to climb out the river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** In case he needs to climb.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Yeah.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Cool.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** So you just give him instructions on how to climb as a bear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:29]** Well, it does say, I also gain an asset on two skills appropriate to your bear form, such as climbing, unarmed fighting, running, or perception.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Ah, fighting as well.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** So you would basically two of those would become eased by one level.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Cool.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Okay.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:42]** Alright, so you're going after Colt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:42 - 00:24:04]** yeah and i assume like what would it count as like climbing like if i went and like latched onto him with my mouth and then tried to climb up the the bank of the river i think you could since we're kind of in combat order i think you could mainline your your bare bone and jump in the water yeah and then we're gonna go to the next person okay cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** So, Kelly, Zoa, Julius, what are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:13]** I think, well... Go ahead, Zoa.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:20]** No, no, no, Julius, you're the ghost, and if I'm learning anything right now is that having weird supernatural shit might be useful.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:22]** I don't know what I could do, so what would you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:37]** Julius is going to look around, and I think he's trying to ascertain through his ghostly aura, through some sense of trying to permeate the mystical and the green and the dark.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:50]** And he wants to talk to the river and say that we are here to learn how to save the Water Mender.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** None of us are against you.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** And destroy the dam.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** And destroy the dam.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Thank you, Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:01]** Don't forget to tell them!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Destroy the dam!

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:08]** We're here to help you, and we need our friend to successfully make you okay.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Damn the dam!

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Please be nice to him.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** And also, the bear is ours, too.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** He's with us.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** The bear is also ours.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Yeah, he's ours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** Okay, so let's do this.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** This is going to be complicated rolling.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Love it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** Nothing like a complicated roll-off.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** Because the way I heard it... Cole, you're underwater.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Like, they definitely can't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:55]** um zoa is assisting julius in convincing the river that y'all are not an enemy you're here to help yeah so zoa first give me an intellect roll to see if you assist julius you know what this is my first good roll and it's a 19 okay so you definitely assist julius that's an asset so julius you convincing the river is eased by one level

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:02]** Now, you are specialized in understanding magic, which would ordinarily ease this by two levels.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:09]** But since you're also trying to persuade, which you have an inability in, that would make it more difficult by one level.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** So your skills are going to ease it by one.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:16]** Your asset is going to ease it by one for a total of two eases.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** If you want to apply effort to it, now is your opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** I'm definitely going to apply effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Which would be intellect, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Yes.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Yeah.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** And I have an edge in intellect.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:31]** So spend three minus one from your intellect pool to ease it a third level.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Okay.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** And make your roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** So it's three levels and I give it a roll, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Roll high.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** I hope so.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** I rolled a 10.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** Ooh.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Okay.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** F***.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Middling roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Middling roll.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** A 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** In this game, 10 is not even middling.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** It's bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** In this game, 10 is exactly middling.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Alright, alright.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:06]** And it's a good thing you spent all of that time and effort to ease this roll because...

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:28]** um the river believes you um it recognizes that you're not the foes that it thought you were um and so uh i can't remember what my voice for the river was but i'm gonna try this one um you are not you are not you did not steal friends

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:35]** And you hear it, like, start to calm down, and it releases you, Cole.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:39]** You're no longer stuck in that whirlwind, and you can, like, swim up to the surface.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** And there's a bear coming towards you.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** What the?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** What the?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Just rushing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** What happened to Hyrule?

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:54]** What in God's creation happened here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Nope.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** He's a bear for the next hour.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** I love this.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Is it only one hour?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Can you do it for like ever if you wanted to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** No, it's one hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Right.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Not with a cipher.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:14]** Anyway, we can maybe come up with an artifact at some point.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:38]** and so uh the river's no longer attacking you um thank you i mean i i still want to come up as a bear and start pulling him towards the shore it's not the best thing ever so so cole you're in the water and you see a bear lumbering towards you like ma a gape and it like grabs you by you think it's gonna bite your neck but it grabs you by the collar


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:59]** Yeah, Ira's gonna, like, grab, he has, like, he has a bunch of just garbage on him that was weighing him down, and he, like, grabs a cast iron griddle from his, like, satchel or whatever, and he's, like, he's gonna just, like, kinda try to hit the bear.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** He doesn't know.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** And he's gonna be like, Ira's, what, what happened to Ira?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:14]** I think with his... He tries to block the pan and he can't communicate to you verbally.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:20]** So he just nudges the side of your head with his nose and then licks your temple.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Like a dog would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** Who's the meathead now, Ira?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:49]** does the bear chuckle that's good i love this cool so now that things have calmed down and we know that the the watermander was here but she was taken forcefully from her home

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:55]** We know the river kind of saw what happened, but also really only knows that the river's friend was taken.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:01]** You guys can step out of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:27]** the watermander's home unless there's something else you wanted to investigate in there uh for the way you say that makes me think yes i think i think cole's gonna drop the uh witch ward that he had um which gave me armor equal to the cipher level yeah um and get the charm of reversal instead awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:31]** Cole, were you feeling okay after that, getting all that water on your lungs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:42]** I'm a bit perplexed as to the circumstances that made Ira bear, but I'm glad that this water has calmed down, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** Yeah, I mean, it pulled you aggressively out.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** And yeah, Ira is a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:52]** How on earth did such a transformation occur?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Was it the...

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** Was it the water itself, or what?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** I mean, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** No, I think Ira is full of secrets.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** One of these charms we have, I suppose.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** I think it was a cypher, yeah.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** I think it was.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** I think it was some... Oh, that's right.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** He railed it, just like having a good time.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** He railed it?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** He railed it.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** He did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:40]** someone loves animals and i was just gonna say like he he knows he only has an hour with bear so he's just gonna like kind of like take his head and scritch him behind the ears that's a cute one that's a good boy oh yeah there you go that's the right spot you start scratching your back on a tree you're like yeah yeah look uh if


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:51]** In there, we saw that the door was some sort of a skinwalker creature or something that broke down that door.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** And there was a struggle in there.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** So...

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** Wherever the watermander went, she did not go willingly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:05]** Julius, you think you could speak again with that river?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** I shouldn't ask her.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** Maybe if they know where they took the watermander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:19]** Before we do that, give me either a perception or a search or just a straight-up intelligence roll.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Everyone.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Seventeen, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:27]** Today is my revenge rolling day.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Not to you.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** My revenge rolling day.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** Cole got a nine.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** You're still caught.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** I'm just perplexed.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** I'm glad to be alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** You got an eighteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** Okay.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** One better than Zoe.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** What'd you get, Julius?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** 19.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Two better than Zoe.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** 19.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:52]** We're a bunch of smart cookies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** I'm assuming you guys have gotten off the dock and around the riverbank now.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** Julius, as you turn back toward the river, you notice something that you didn't see before.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:10]** You can see not quite a trench, but you can see where very clearly there are drag marks on the riverbank.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:33]** and very large footprints and zoa and ira you see it too of something carrying a creature about the size of the watermander off into the woods will as as a bear uh i would like to use my enhanced sense of smell to start tracking and following the footsteps

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** I love this.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Yes.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** So you track.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Do each of you follow him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** Yeah.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:48]** As a bear, we should follow his enhanced sense of smell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:55]** I mean, he stands up as bears can do on their hind legs and literally waves you guys to come on.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** Drops back down, starts sniffing the path and walking away.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** That's our answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:04]** So you can see large, heavy booted footprints.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:10]** You can see the manor, which is on the hunt, right?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** You walk through the woods following this trail.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** It's a buzz with insects.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** You hear like birds calling sounds of alarm as you walk through.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:31]** And you also notice a particular kind of mushroom that only exists in this area of the forest.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** Forestry?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** Ira, you can smell these mushrooms because of your enhanced bare nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Has Ira consumed this kind of mushroom before?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Because he has consumed a lot of mushrooms.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Oh, this is Zoa.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** This is Zyra.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Oh, my God.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** I got the beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** You don't know how many mushrooms I've consumed.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** My bad.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Oh, my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:55]** What kind of mushrooms we got growing around here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** I have not seen these before.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** Well, I do have herbalism.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Perhaps I could roll.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Yeah, roll herbalism.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** Roll what, Benny?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Herbalism.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I don't know.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** That was a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** You don't know.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** You can tell that they're mushrooms and that they're brown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** I'm trained in herbalism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Okay.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:21]** If you crush the stems and smudge them, is there blue?

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** I did not.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** I don't have any herbalism expertise coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Roll herbalism.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Me?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Okay.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:33]** I'm going to make this kind of a closed game a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Heath, I'm going to DM you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:56]** Okay, so if the spines are straight on the cap... Will lives in a... Whatever you could communicate as a bear, you can communicate to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** So, are these... Where are these mushrooms?

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** They're just on the ground next to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Yeah.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:14]** He comes up like he's been sniffing the path and Bear Ira comes up, sniffs at the mushroom, touches his nose to it, and then takes his claws and just rips them apart.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:23]** Just digs into them, shreds them, and then throws them like a dog, you know, digging dirt out, throws it behind him, you know?


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** Like, obviously trying to get rid of the mushrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** What a good boy.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:33]** And you take three points of might damage just from touching one of these mushrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** Oof.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Oh.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** I don't have a lot of might to begin with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Right?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** Anybody can patch up our bear boy.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** I mean, I'm seeing him limping here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:51]** Paul has touched those mushrooms, so that is... Yeah, and you can see, like, his nose, even though it was black, is, like, very clearly inflamed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** Now, is my might pool the same even though I'm a bear?

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:04]** Is it like a druid in Warcraft or in a TTRPG where you have a separate HP pool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** No, this is your pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** You got to try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** If it was an artifact, I might have given it to you.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** But since it's just a cipher, no, it's your it's your might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Now... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** So, Colton.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** Well, Ira too.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Ira Bear.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** That's what I'm going to call you right now for the next hour.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:29]** Would it be worth possibly knowing more what this thing is?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Because I do have this chicken feather brush and I can't really...

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:37]** I got too many of these ciphers on me right now, so I'm wondering if we want to know what this is.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Maybe it's something we want to save for later.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** We can't touch it, but if anybody's got a bag, we can grab it and use it.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** It deals damage just from touching.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** It seems to injure you.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:52]** I say that's a good idea there, Julius.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** All right.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Pulls out the chicken feather brush.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:01]** I imagine it's like literally a bunch of chicken feathers tied to a stick.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** Kind of go up, tentatively brush the mushrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Be careful, Julius.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Well, actually, wait.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Never mind.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** You're already dead.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Go ahead, Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:29]** ooh the thing is um yeah i'm supposed to ask permission to know it yeah so as he's brushing over it he says you know mycelium have neural networks yeah i think you can communicate with mushrooms there's there's science behind that i think so too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:38]** He's going to say, I know that you are not inherently evil or bad, but you have developed a defense against something in this world.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** I don't mean to injure you any further.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** I just want to know who you are and what you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** I'm not trying to aggravate you at all.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:55]** You learn two important and useful things about the object.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Cool.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** You know that...

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:23]** uh actually i'll give you this because you are specialized in understanding magic one you you've seen what it does if you touch it right if you ingest it it will kill you um mechanically it will knock you down the damage track so it'd be as if one of your pools was instantly zero

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** Sounds like a good poison.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:40]** Two, you, Julius, know that these are often used in spells to break magical restraints.

**[00:39:40 - 00:40:04]** what's the name of the mushroom or like what does it tell me like it's got its name um and this is a magic like you just the the brush sort of transmits this knowledge up your ethereal hand into your brain um and so it tells you oh i guess you would learn the name it's a deadly webcap mushroom rad

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** So it... Not to be confused with actual death caps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** So it's a deadly web cap mushroom.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Yep.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:18]** Yeah, I think your senses were definitely right there.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Comantia phalloidis.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** That's something phalloidis.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** That's what this mushroom is.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:30]** If you ingest it, it is very deadly, but it could be used for magical restraint.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Does anyone have a bag?

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Something we can maybe put one or two of these in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** Not for magical restraint.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Used to break magical restraint.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** Sorry, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Yeah.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Used in, like, spell making?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Potion making, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:45 - 00:41:03]** uh yeah i i have vinny related to this like i can create i think with my experience so i need three x xp to level up is that correct four four okay never mind um that's four then

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** I mean, I can give you something off my back, Julius.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:12]** I don't have any bags, but... Just something so we don't touch it.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** I don't know.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I guess I have a jacket or something.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:19]** If you wouldn't mind taking this, and since you're incorporeal, maybe carry it with you.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Sure.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, there you are.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Okay.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Hands over.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Wraps it up.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** It's humid enough as it is anyway.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Yeah.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** Accidentally dabs himself on the neck with the mushroom.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** Oh, God.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** Did it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** First day as an assassin.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:42]** He's pulled off the hat trick, ladies and gentlemen.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:49]** This man is incredibly skilled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** Alright, so where do we go next?

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** This is a good find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Are we still following the path, or does the path end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** Nope, you're still following the path.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:11]** As you follow the path, you break through the tree line to see an overgrown what appears to be a very long past deserted mine.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:15]** You might recognize this from your childhood as the mine that you're

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:20]** Your parents, those who were coal miners, worked in before it dried up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** A.K.A.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Van Delver.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** Yeah, I was like, you might recognize this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Is this a lost mine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:32]** Julius, I would like for you to make a perception check.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** Alrighty.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** That's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** He's still thinking about these mushrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:43]** And also just marveling at how badass Ira Bear is.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** He is badass.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** Just take a moment to admire him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** He can stand up.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** He's just flexing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** We really need to keep going, Ira.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** Just keep applauding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:02]** I'm so gleefully applauding along Zoe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** So are we going in the mine?

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Or is it blocked off or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:14]** There's a very clear path gone in where you see boot prints and drag marks going into the mine.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Oh, there you go.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** Well, if we're going to go, I'll lead the way as long as I'm a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:25]** I mean, it makes sense for a bear to be exploring a cavernous area.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:29]** Yeah, even if we come up on him, it's like, oh, it's just a bear.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** It's not somebody looking for me.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:37]** Everyone just huddle behind Ira as he goes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Slowly sneak up behind.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** I would recommend that, yeah.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** I will... I think Cole would go behind.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Directly behind the bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** So we'll go next.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Julius is invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** So there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** I mean, Julius could go ahead.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Right?

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** In theory.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** That's true, Julius.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** But... You get to be our scout.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** If they're magical, maybe that's a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Perhaps.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** I mean, it feels like Ira going first as a bear is probably good.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** I reckon so.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** I think we're waiting because Benny asked Julius to roll a perception check, and then I guess there's just nothing.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** Julius is still also thinking about the white thing, about how there wasn't any pain.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:23]** There wasn't any visible injury, but we got injured.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** He's still trying to picture all this stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:33]** That is... I mean, that's about the long and short of it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** You didn't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** I didn't roll on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:57]** now um cool so you enter the mine and you walk for a few minutes i'm checking your character sheets for one quick thing which i think is yep cool so you're walking along you're walking along um all of a sudden

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:15]** Zoa and Ira, as you're walking along, you notice at the last moment an ethereal hand showing up out of nowhere, grabbing you on the shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Both of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Each of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** The same hand is large enough to grab both of us, or there's two hands?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Two hands.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Okay.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:35]** Each of those two hands grabs you, and you immediately feel your brain becomes foggy, and your body starts to twitch, almost as if your shoulder is aging faster than the rest of you.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** And you each take four intellect damage.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:48]** This is cool music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Not a cool circumstance, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Wow.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:58]** I don't feel epic enough in response to warrant it, but we shall remedy that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** I really wish I kept my witch ward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Well, at least it's just a perk.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** I rolled a one.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Sorry, I'm happy to go last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** I got a seven.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Julia's got a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Cole got a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** Okay.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Nice.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** So, Cole goes before these two things.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Okay, the two things.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** That's good to know.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** And also bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Cole, what do you do?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:40]** Having no idea of what is going... Like, do I see anything other than I just hear... Yeah, you just hear Zoa and Iroh react to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:50]** presumably roar and scream oh god i don't know how do zoa and iry react to getting their intelligence sapped


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** And you said their bodies are going limp, kind of out of control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** They just kind of breeze out.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:07]** I have a complete inability to understand or use magic.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:22]** And so Cole is just going to run quickly over to him and try to grasp them and maybe pull them away, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:44]** okay so that's your turn uh cole you let's start with julius julius as you hear this scream and you turn around you see two imagine like the ghost of or uh like like bob cratchit

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:55]** Tattered clothes, chains, skin worn off, but it's all ethereal, bony hand reaching toward... One toward you.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** You see another of these creatures reaching a hand toward Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** So, okay, so there's two... I see two creatures.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:09]** One... Each has one hand on Zoa and Ira, and the other hand's coming towards Cole and I. Yes.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Um...

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:17]** So, Julius, make a speed defense roll.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** You make a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** I am... I forget.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:27]** I am trained in speed defense, so... That's a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** And that is enough.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** You managed to dodge out of the way.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:37]** If you wanted to try to guide Cole...

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:48]** I would give Cole... It would be more difficult for him to dodge because he can't see the ghosts.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** But I would give him the opportunity to dodge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Do I know why?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** I mean, yes.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** Cole, there is something mystical going on.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:02]** These shackled zombie ethereal beings keep your wits about you.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** Can I see them because I'm a ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:09]** You know enough about magic to know that you can see them because you're a ghost, and they can't because they're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** They can only see you because of the pact with Rabbit Rabbit.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Okay.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Sounds good.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:24]** Cole, you're going to need to be quick on your feet, and we're going to need to push one way or the other, either deeper into the mine or back out to safety and regroup.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** That's probably all I have time to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Yep.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** So, Cole, I'm assuming you try to dodge.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Give me a speed defense roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Yep.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** And I rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:50]** ooh 17 you heated julius's warning to the letter you dodge roll your way out dodge dip dive under the clutches of these ghosts zoa and ira it is your turn you two what are you gonna do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:57]** I mean, I'm a bear, so I just want to try to attack it, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Okay.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Julius, am I assuming you're directing traffic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** Yeah.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** Okay.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:09]** You mean directing traffic like where to go or like here's where the ghost is?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Right.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:16]** Is it safe to assume that Julius understands that he's the only one that can see these ghosts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** Then I'm just going to assume that you're telling Ira where they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Just point in a direction.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** He's going to maul away.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** Yeah, absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** All right.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:31]** Ira, make an unarmed attack roll.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:59]** that just a d20 roll uh yep so that'll be a d20 and i'll ease it by one because i'll assume your bear form gives you uh is that okay that's a 17 oh okay let me hit as a bear you do hit as a bear yeah yeah this is actually curious i'm gonna i'm gonna rule this as a magic attack because i like what happened um

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:09]** So you notice that there's a, as you're swiping through what you perceive as midair, there's like a fiery crackle that comes off of your claws as it strikes these ghosts.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:12]** Wow.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:20]** Julius, you see the ghost that he hit just poof into ectoplasm.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Wow.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Nice hit, Ira.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** We need one more.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** That ghost is gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** Zohar, are you doing anything?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:38]** I mean, Zohar seeing that has some confidence rise up in him.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** And I'm guessing maybe Julius is telling him vaguely where it is.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** And plus, him being touched, he might know the location of this.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** Is that safe to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Right at your 5 o'clock.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** Punch in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Clemmy, get ready.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:05]** He turns towards it and fires his rifle at the general area from which he was touched with an 18 attack roll.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** That's four damage if that hits.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:16]** Clemmy will then kind of run up like his rifle and then jump at the general direction of that as well.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:20]** It's little claws, little lizard feet going onto it.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:25]** Since it's like, I hope these kinds of attacks will work.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** There you go.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** That's what he says.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** You get a roll for Clemmy.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Yeah.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** I got a roll for Clemmy.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Oh, Clemmy.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** That's a good girl.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** You can do it.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** Clemmy doesn't make it, I think, with a three.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Just comes right through the ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Definitely not.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** Give me a D100 roll.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Okie dokie.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Was this our first D100?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** No, it's not, right?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** I think it is.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** One moment, please.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I mean, on this show, at least.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** In my life.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** in your entire life?

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** I don't have a D100, so I'm just doing a quick calculation here.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Are we just making up our own numbers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** He's rolling a D100 in his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** I'm just going to do a quick calculation.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:12]** 45 plus 30 is... Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:12]** It's a 56.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:17]** It's on the greater side of 50.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** You're shooting at a ghost.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** That ghost is currently touching one of your colleagues.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:28]** That roll was to see if your shot passes through the ghost and into one of your colleagues.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** You missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Oh, no.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** I missed the colleague but got the ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Yeah.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Amazing.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** All right.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Which colleague would it have been?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:40]** It would have been Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** I'm so cold in the butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** We don't want Cole to die almost again today.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Cool.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** So you've hit it.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** Julius sees the ghostly apparition.

**[00:53:52 - 00:54:00]** Where the bullet passes through, it expands into a circle and then slowly comes back in, but not quite as closed as it was before.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:05]** So well done, Zoa Green.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** We're at the top of round two.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** Cole Ward, you were the only one quicker on the draw than these ghosts.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** What do you want to do, sir?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:20]** Um, gosh, I mean, I think I'm going to swing my machete just wildly.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:24]** I don't know where they are, how close they are to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:34]** Julius can, can, I mean, I'm kind of assuming Benny that like, that's my turn most of the time is like doing that, but I don't know how you want to treat it in terms of like round and turn order.

**[00:54:34 - 00:55:04]** I think I'm fine with you like talking Cole through like because I guess you can see if he's going to swing the machete wildly I don't know what your advice would do if he's just like no come closer to me yeah I mean like having said over there yeah like I would be pointed yeah on the directional yeah it's like five feet this way and it was behind Zoa so you know that kind of thing yep cool Cole roll your attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** I'm rolling as in spinning.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:14]** I thought it was spinning and it was going to work, but then it wasn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:19]** I rolled a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:25]** Unfortunately, that is not enough.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** Dodges, ducks, dips, dives, and dodges.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Your machete swings.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** God.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** And with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Cursing.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** God.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:40]** You see, Julius, this ghost disengage and get the f*** out of here.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** He's gone.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Smart ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** That ghost gave up the ghost.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** We are safe for the moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Okay.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Do you just see him, like, run away?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Like, out of the cave?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** The ghost just don't give up.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Just pull on, like, death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Basically.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Back up and flick me off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:17]** uh yeah he he actually uh apparates a third middle finger that's not a finger awesome what's the light level in here um you're still at the mouth of the mine so like you can still get but it is getting much darker very quickly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:21]** Well, I have a lantern still.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Break out your lantern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:25]** Yeah, definitely break out your lanterns if you want to be able to see.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** If you don't want to be able to see, that's on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** Also, just know that the enemy will be able to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Yeah, that's the thing.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** We've lost the element of surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** Ira does probably have bear vision now.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** Do bears have dark vision?

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Gotta see better than we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** Do bears see in the dark?

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** Their night vision is excellent.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Nice.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** And they are particularly sensitive to detecting movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:53 - 00:57:04]** I mean, we could stay, we could try to keep hidden and stay behind our friend Ira here.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:08]** We have lanterns if we need, but it will not give away our position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:13]** I do reckon that keeping in the dark behind Ira might be the way to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** I think so.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:19]** I also have a cipher that allows me to see in the dark for 24 hours.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** So I might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:24]** It's like Metal Gear Ursa over here.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Yeah.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Stealthing in, cracking necks.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** As a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Hey, so who is hurt the most?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** Like, what's our health situation?

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Who do we need to be worried about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Well, I'm a...

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:43]** I'm halfway down my might, and I've lost about eight points.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** I didn't lose anything from the river, right?

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** I feel dumb as **** today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** You didn't.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:54]** I was going to wait for your turn to do that drowning damage.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Yeah.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Because it didn't hit you.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** It just grabbed you and pulled you under.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** I'm like down 12 in total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** Thank God for the powers of persuasion and bears.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** And bears.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** And bears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Okay.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:16]** I do have something that can help in case there's somebody who is close to death.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** I have a candle that can protect you from death.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** I think I'm okay for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:28]** I'm at 9 out of 17 intellect.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** Five out of eight might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:37]** And you'd also get plus one to your recovery since we've been around for a minute.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:42]** Well, I've already used my instant one.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Is the second one a minute or an hour?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** The second one is ten minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** 10 minutes, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Can you pick any of those?

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:53]** Like, can you choose to, or you only can do an instant?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Do you have to do them in order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** It's always in that order.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Oh.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** I had selected 10 minutes last time.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** I was wrong.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:03]** I may take 10 minutes too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:08]** For the sake of trying to be relatively honest here.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** I only get an hour as a bear.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** Are we almost done with that hour, or I still got some time?

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** Because I got him out of the river pretty quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** You got him out of the river quick.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:20]** It's about a 20-minute walk to get to the mouth of the mine.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** You had a quick fight.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** I'd say you're probably halfway through the hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:28]** So I could do a 10-minute rest and then have 20 minutes of bear time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** And then I can leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** All right, let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** Cool, so y'all are going to... I just roll a d6?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Yep, roll a d6.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** Plus one for your tier, plus an extra one for Cole's ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** Well, then that's eight for me, baby!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** I got seven.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Congratulations.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** The one action, because I haven't done any recovery rolls yet.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:55]** So if I do the one action one or the instant one, I can do that at any time, right?

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Even during combat, perhaps.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** Yes.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Okay, cool.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** I'm going to save my recovery for later.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Will, that was terrifying.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:08]** Could I see what kind of ghosts they, like, were they miners?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** Were they lost travelers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** They were blues travelers.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Blues travelers.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** What are you doing here?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** You're not from this time.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** It was one chubby guy with like 18 harmonicas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** They were like real long-haired hippie looking dudes named Hanson.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:55]** no that's an underrated band i think they're pretty good yeah uh we'll talk about that next step i guess um so long as you sing with inflection the you you could tell that they they had like suit suit pants and and waistcoats and and like buttons like they were they were sort of management types but tattered because they've been ghosts for a while


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]** And waist pants and arm shoes and all kinds of stuff.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** And head feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:04]** Cool.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:04]** All right.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:08]** So Ira leads the way and you make your way further down the mine, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:11]** Making my way down mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:18]** You hear a harmonica in the distance.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** From down the mic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:29]** Being a bear in a fucking mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:37]** So we're working your way down the mine, and as it bends around to your right, you notice a pinpoint of light.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** I'm assuming you move closer to it?

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Let's hop to it.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** You keep going.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:47]** This mine is still undulating.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:53]** It's difficult to get down and pitch total darkness, but your bare eyes are able to guide you and the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** What do you see with your bare eyes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:07]** You see, as you step into this room, a slight middle-aged woman sitting on the ground, hugging her knees.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** You son of a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:18]** Is she going to open her mouth and jaw and have, like, fangs and be like, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** She's also a bear.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Kidnap is out.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** What, Amanda?

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** She's part of bear travel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]** She snorts some bear dust, turns into a bear, and is like, I've got 40 minutes.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Brings you back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:39]** This entire game is actually just Shrek.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Yeah.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** You two go off as bears and get married.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** I'm here for it.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Oh, my God.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** We're actually saving.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** This is the quest to save Fiona.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** This is awesome.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** Yeah.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** This is great.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Amazing.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Awesome.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** Fun stuff.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** Good game.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** Cool fun.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Yeah.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:54]** Peace.
