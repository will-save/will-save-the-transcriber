## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:03]** What am I doing on this call, Kev?

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:07]** Welcome back to We'll Save the Interview.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:10]** I will be your host, Kevin Decker.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:15]** I stole it from John, just like I did the GM seat for Unknown Treasures.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:19]** But this is an interview show and it takes two people to do an interview.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:22]** So let's bring on our first guest, Jonathan Swanathan.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:23]** Hello.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:26]** Hello, I'm Jonathan Jonathan.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:27]** Wait, bring Jonathan in here.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:29]** No, this is... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** That was my time to shine.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:35]** Alright, I'm leaving now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:39]** John turned off his voice modular, and this is his actual voice, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:41]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:41]** How's it going?

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** Sorry, I just turned my voice modulator back on.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:46]** Alright, I had to pitch it up a little bit.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:46]** There we go.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:47]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:50]** Alright, now that you're all fixed up and ready to go.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:51]** Welcome, John.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:52]** Welcome.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:53]** How are you feeling tonight?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:54]** What's new?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:55]** Good.

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:00]** Bummed that my alter ego, Jonathan Swanathan, couldn't take the stage for the first time ever.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** Yeah, it's a bummer.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:04]** Actually, my friend...

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:06]** Uh, Andrew Hanson, shout out Andrew Hanson.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:11]** You know, Andrew, he, uh, he has amazing handwriting and I've known him since sixth grade.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:15]** And at one point in eighth grade, I think he w he made fun of my signature.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:17]** Cause I don't have that great of handwriting.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:22]** And he was like, your name looks like it is Jabonathan Juan.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:27]** And I was like, that's absolutely correct.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** So that's how I sign all my cards to him.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Jonathan Juan.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Jabonathan Juan.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Jabonathan Juan.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** Yeah.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Easy.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:41]** Your classic mistake when reading Jonathan Swan.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** The eye likes to play tricks on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** I just do.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Well, you've seen my signature.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** It's a loaf of bread and a hockey stick and a Nike Swoosh.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:55]** Yeah, because you're an illustrator artist and you're skilled and it looks cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** I spent at least three six-hour watches.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** just writing my signature over and over and over again.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** Cause I wasn't, I wasn't happy with my signature and I just kept trying different things.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** And I was like, I kind of like that.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** And so I stuck with it.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:14]** Cause my dad's signature has always been this, like, he has a very vertical, large letters.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:25]** So it's just like, you see a K and then you, uh, you see that the T for his, cause it's Kenneth, you see the T and then the D is a big D. And then there's another K in there for Decker.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** Um,

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** But the rest of the letters in there are just little scribbles.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** And I've always loved his signature.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** And so I was like, I need that for me.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I need a cool signature.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** Yeah.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** So I have that now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** So that is your signature now.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Right.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** And you spent a long time perfecting it.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** And to be clear, you weren't writing on the walls, right?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Which would be really creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** No, I had a notebook.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** Okay, good.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Yeah.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:50]** I got to burn that thing because it had all my secrets in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:17]** oh well it's also every iteration of my signature and it had your secrets right which which seems to me like a great uh great you know simile just for your descent into madness because it's your secrets maybe a couple signatures then some more just pages of pages all over the wall just it's just a big team i used to just put the papers i would put the paper on the wall

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:43]** yeah yeah exactly but yeah my dad's signature is a literal scribble so that's how he's always signed it i'm like all right cool sounds like is he a doctor because that makes sense uh no oh okay well actually yes he is a doctor i i take that back he is a doctor in ethnomusicology there you go there yeah so he has the right to just scribble apparently that's a rule yeah he it's it's like he always knew that he would become a doctor yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:48]** Oh, he was doing that before he was a doctor, so that's... Yeah, he was cheating.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Or he's foretelling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Wait, Kev, I didn't ask you, how are you doing today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I'm good.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** I've had a... I just got back from New Jersey.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** That was a fun trip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Do you have any gabagool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** I didn't.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Well, no, maybe I did.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** I don't know.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:14]** So the company I was at, they serve lunches and every day, there's three days of this review and every day or every time they serve the same meal in the same order.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]** So the first day is always sandwiches from this one deli up there.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** And the second day is pasta from this pasta place.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** And the third day is pizza.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Every time.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** Always the same three restaurants and the same three order.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Like, yeah.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** But it's good.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** I liked it.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Well, you know what you're going to get.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** Yeah.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** But I'm home now.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** That's all that matters.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** And I'm here hanging out with my friend, John.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I tell you, one of my best friends.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** You were definitely one of my best friends.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** If not the bestest.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Oh, dude, you were one of my best friends.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** What?

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:43 - 00:05:09]** air hugs dude there's no air hugs i thought 25 3 000 miles a second yeah dude no like no he's my son come on wow that felt very that's my son there's come here son let me shake your hand we argue all the time about who this the adult is in this room but those are that relationship i'm the adult no grayson i'm the adult yeah you sit down yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** It's classic.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:13]** I guess he told Lauren that he missed it.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** I was like, oh, texting them on my way home.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Or I was doing it over Siri.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** Like, Siri, tell Lauren I made it to Maryland.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** And she responded back.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:27]** And I didn't realize it was from her because it was in the car and over audio.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** But it just said, I miss him.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:35]** And the next line was, I'm going to tell him I don't like that sound.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** And I finally stopped at a stoplight and, like, checked the message.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** And it was quotes.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** So it was from my son.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** But he doesn't like the sound of the rental car horn.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** Like, when it locks, it actually honks.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:55]** He waited three full days to tell me that he didn't like that sound.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** He told my wife, I'm going to tell him I don't like that sound.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:04]** And the first thing he said to me when I got home was, hi, daddy, I don't like that sound.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** I was just like, great, thank you.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** And you're like, I'm the adult in the room.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Right.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** This is what I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** You go rent your own car.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** That's funny.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** That's very cute.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** Well, I think that was fun banter.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** I loved it.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** That was great banter.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:25]** I was going to ask you, I heard you wanted to talk about Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:31]** I just wanted to shout out that Foundry is awesome because as Kev and I were getting warmed up a couple times, Kev was like, all right, I'm ready.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** And I'm like, hang on.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** I'm still going to change this tile.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:36]** I got to rotate.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:42]** I can do an internal halo on this light.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** Hold on.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** And then if I combine it with this other light, then it looks cool.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Yeah, that was cool.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** So shout out to Foundry.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:53]** And you are doing Foundry in preparation for what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Just for fun.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** Okay, cool.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Just checking.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** I don't know if you've got something going on.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** God, man.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:04]** If this was for a podcast, I would just be, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** Speaking of podcasts, though, I have these three little cue cards here.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:13]** I stole them from the other host of this show.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** And I got three questions to ask you.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** So I'm just going to jump into it.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Question number one.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:19]** Number one.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:26]** Tell me about your characters that you play in Threefold Conspiracy and Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Okay.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** I gotta think about this.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:34]** It's a lot of... Should I pull a Kevin Decker?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** I play... I don't know.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:52]** I play... I play... I play... I play... I play... I play... I play... I'm the GM of Threefold Conspiracies.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** I play all these other characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** I knew that.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** I knew that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Really?

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** I knew that you were the GM.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I didn't know that.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** I just thought I was hanging out and I never made a character.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** I was a little late to the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** My PCs keep dying.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I don't understand.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** Guys, please.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** We don't have to get into a fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** I'm trying to help you out.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** What a fun concept for a show.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** You're like, I didn't know I was GMing.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** I thought I was just playing with everybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** Write that one down in the notebook.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I'll write it down.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:34]** You know, I was thinking about it the other day, and I was trying to think about all the PCs, the NPCs that I have created.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** And so, who knows?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** Maybe there will be some more NPCs that I've created.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:44]** And every NPC you make is friendly and does not want to fight whatsoever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Cause I don't know that I'm GMing.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** So yeah, they're always going to be friendly.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:57]** Definitely not going to be a mysterious duplicitous in any way that would somehow align with the banner title of the show.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** The threefold conspiracy.

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** Definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Well, there's three folds to it.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** So one of those folds could be good.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** Yeah.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** It, which is like an origami fold.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** It's good.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:12]** So in the brilliantly run unknown treasures.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** You're just saying that cause I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** Well, I would also say if you weren't here, but it'd be weird to be on a call by myself saying that.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:33]** So I play Rolu and I am the, I guess, best companion, best friend of here's Fabricius.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:40]** And maybe here's his most trusted confidant is a way to put it.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** coworker, colleague.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** And I served on Hears' ship.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** Speaking of ships, in my headcanon, I'm shipping them.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** I learned that from you.

**[00:09:52 - 00:10:00]** I think Hears and Rolu actually secretly had a connection, a romantic connection.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:07]** And that's why Hears is so upset when, spoiler alert, Rolu was killed.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** If you haven't listened to episode one, wait, sorry, what was that, Kev?


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** Huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** Oh yeah, Rollo died.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Yeah, Rollo died.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:20]** I guess this is kind of a follow-up question because this is...

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:26]** This is a different interview in the fact that you are the GM of our main show and you were a player in this one.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:31]** ROLU was actually the first time that you ever played a character in Starfinder, correct?

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Correct.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:46]** I'm very curious, like, what is your experience with going from omniscient and omnipotent GM of every game you've ever played for Starfinder and then going to a very limited first-person perspective of ROLU?


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Oh, it's so freeing.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:56]** It's so nice to just have one character to focus on and lean into and develop.

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:05]** And I definitely made too much backstory that now I have to fill in in threefold and link up somehow because I was like, this is cool and this is cool.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** And what if you did this?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** And then you would throw something at me, Kev, and I'd be like, oh, that's awesome because that fits in with this.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** But how do I share that?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** And there are definitely things that I didn't share that I would love to have shared.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** You can share them here if you want.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** You know, I think I talked about...

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:52]** think i talked about rolu so one of the oh shoot i'm trying to find it right now one of the important milestone moments in a kasathan's life is when they go on a sort of journey for about a year where they can leave the adari or their family and go do things and i you know i i believe i shared that rolu spent time on his you know wardenship around that time and then i just never got into the

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** What happened after that?

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:02]** And Rolu was trying to maybe not be the most forthright about his precog abilities, right?

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:08]** And they felt like, maybe I don't always need to share that.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** And I'll just say that, you know, sometimes things happen on their own.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:17]** Sometimes you need a little coaxing, need a little training.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** to get things.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:23]** So there's parts of Rolo's backstory that I thought I want to tie in.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:24]** Maybe it'll tie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:32]** I feel like now that you say it, I think you and I definitely had some conversations out like off air about like the direction of the show.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** And I think you revealed some things to me about Rolo that I was like, Oh, that's cool.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** And I don't think it ever came out in the show and I'm not going to say it here.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Cause that's up to you to reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** Oh, I think I, are you talking about Rolo's backstory?

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:48]** Let's call it Rolu's ancestors.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** Rolu's like... Right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** And the Adari itself.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** I don't know if that ever came out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** That was a fun one to come up with.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Do I want to share it?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** I think I'll save it.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** I'll decide at the end of the interview if I want to share it.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Anyway.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** It was very fun.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** We'll do this super long, silent...

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:15]** People realize the show's actually three hours long, but it's actually just nothing until the end.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Stay tuned!

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:24]** If this was TikTok, we'd say, wait towards the end of the video, or whatever they post all over their videos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** It was fun.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** It was very freeing.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** It was a great time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:35]** Freeing is a very interesting perspective, because as the GM, you have full control of everything but the PCs.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Full control.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** But you're saying it's more freeing to just think about your character.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** And I think I get you on that.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** I feel you.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** Because I love playing and I'm not a fan of GMing.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Well, I take that.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** I'm not trying to put down GMing.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** GMing is a lot of fun.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** It's just a little much for me.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** I think you're good at it.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** But I see where you're coming from with that.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** I was just curious if you want to dive any more into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Sure.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** I'll just add that...

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:09]** You know, I really, and I think in our D&D game before we even conceived of a podcast, I thought...

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:26]** I always wanted to make sure that the experience and the story that you all are telling as players supersedes the adventure path in the sense that like it will always be like the adventure path or the adventure is dependent on you as characters.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:31]** So I'm always going to put you all at the heart of the story and your relationships and things that go on.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Right.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:37]** So those are the like guiding lay lines for everything else that's going to branch off with the story.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:47]** Even though I know what the story in theory is, in practice, in the field, at the table, it's going to be dependent on what you're doing.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:52]** So for me, as a GM, I'm always thinking about, well, how does this impact the players?

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** Am I reinforcing their story?

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:01]** Am I challenging them in a way that a writer would for a character?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** Oh, now they have to face this problem or this problem.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** Not in a challenging way of being a...

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:31]** omnipotent just throw monsters at you but you know having you ask questions as your characters about what's important and what you value and things like that so those like that's a lot of stuff right to those are a lot of balls to keep in the air and that when you're just rolu or you're just one player i think there's a lot to keep in the air it's just different

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:53]** right now you're about like your own internal journey and are you whether or not you kick a goblin whether or not you kick a goblin and if you do how does that feel and like that when when when you say it and everyone else is like and your face flushes and you're like i just made a choice i better stick with it oh god


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:09]** right you know i agree i agree i totally agree with you i think uh as as a gm well it's funny because i think jamming and writing i think i've never written an ap so don't get me wrong but like but the idea of writing an ap

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** You're not just writing a story.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** It is not a linear progression of a story.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** No, it's not a book.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** It's not a movie.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** It is.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** You are writing you, I guess, technically it's a choose your own adventure book is what it is.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Yes.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** And so you have to write those alternative endings.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** You have to be prepared for anything and everything.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** And then you're also portraying it, you know, to an audience.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:34]** I also would never say that being a player is easier than being a GM.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** So I just want to make sure that that's clear.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Freeing doesn't mean easier.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:41]** Freeing just meant, in my mind, there's just more of a focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** Being a player is so much easier than a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** I don't know.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:52]** I think being faced with the choices at hand and making them and working with a party.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:57]** And also like for me, combat is not always like, that's not where my mind first goes.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** I always go to role play first.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:03]** So if I'm not playing well in combat, I'm always thinking like, am I not good at combat?

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Is my character supposed to be better at combat?

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:09]** Did I like, was that the choice that my character would make?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** And then I'm, and then I also think, oh, I'm, I'm playing a game.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:17]** You know, like, at some point, I need to remember that I'm playing a game with this combat.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** But then at the same time, I don't want to.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:25]** Like when I went after Tez Tronin, because Tez Tronin was like, oh...

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Was it, what's her name?

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Fari13?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Uh-huh.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Right?

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:38]** When I ran to try and stop Tez because Tez was like, I'm going to go attack Fari13.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** And then I tried my attack and then it failed.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:45]** And I'm like, okay, guess I'll just, that was the role play choice and it failed.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:49]** And I like, that's not the optimizer choice, but I tried it and I'm going to move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:57]** Right, but you committed to your character and what your character would do at that time, which is great because that's what I intended for you to do as the GM.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:04]** I was like, I'm going to pull this character away from the group using Farhari 13, knowing that he's the only one that cares about them.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** I fell into your trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Yes, you did.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Hook, line, and sinker.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Hook, line, and sinker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Wow, amazing.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Cool.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** So I guess just flat out question was, which do you prefer, GMing or playing?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** And it's okay if the answer is both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:22]** I've only played once.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:29]** I'm, I think I probably prefer jamming, but I'm really looking forward to playing again.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Okay.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** If that makes sense.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:39]** But the more I think about it now, I like, to be honest, I just like having a cool moment or a sad moment or a funny moment and

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:45]** And just coming like that, all of our choices coming together for that to happen.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** Like that just makes me happy.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** I'm like, man, that was awesome.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** That was just cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** I don't care if anybody else liked it, but that final episode was so emotional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Like, right.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** It's oh, that was so good.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** That was so good.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** There's nothing like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:09]** I think we've talked about this, but the four characters playing Unknown Treasures, they started off at least knowing each other.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:16]** So we haven't gotten to that bonding with the other four in Threefold.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** Like it's starting, it's there.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** There's definitely bonds being formed, but like they weren't as close and as, as rooted as the player, the players from unknown treasures.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** Um, and so I, I'm sure by book six, right.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:35]** I'm sure by book six, we will get a similar response from everyone.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** And yeah, I, this isn't my interview, but I am so excited for threefold.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:43]** Um, but speaking of treasures, I have a second cue card here.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** Um,

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** What was Rolu thinking at the end?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** And as a player, what were you thinking?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** What were your thoughts

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:58]** And it's interesting because for you, the show, you knew Unknown Treasures was built around Rolu.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** We knew Rolu was the beginning and the end.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:07]** You knew what had to happen, and we were going to make it happen one way or another.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:16]** Not saying there's any plot armor there, but you and I had plenty of discussions of like, look, you need to get away with the stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Yeah.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** And I would always say, you know, if he, yeah, if he dies, he dies.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** It's fine.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** We'll, we'll figure it out.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** So at the end I was, well, the episode right before, right.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** The whole final end sequence, I was trying to figure out.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:47]** which I think fits with Rolu, coincidentally, and me, was that I was trying to figure out what Rolu needs to share to build up his character to Chak in order to get the stone to convince Chak.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:52]** Then, which is evident and, you know, like I would say something and then we'd move and fight and then say something and then move and fight.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** And I was trying to...

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** go on this like moral thing.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:04]** And I remember I said to Vinny, I think there's something I want to say to you to get the stone from you.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:15]** And I'm not going to say anything about what I'm thinking per se, but I just want to add, like, I think, I think I basically said like, what is it that Chuck is interested in?

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:18]** Because I started to realize, like, I can't think about Rolo in this moment.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** And maybe Rolo needs to stop thinking about Rolo.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:26]** Because Rolo's committed to here's and everyone there.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Right.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** And Chad and all that.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Right.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** But like Chad recipes, Chad.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** Yeah.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Poor went out for Chad.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:44]** But Rolo needs to understand that like his ties to this crew here need to extend more than just a job.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** And he views them as a family in a job because that's literally what he's supposed to do.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** But also he needs to think about them as just people.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** So that's when I started to move in.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Well, what does Chak want?

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:58]** So up until then, up until Chak said yes, I had no idea.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:03]** And then as soon as Chak said yes, then Chak asking Treme was like,

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** Oh, this does go like as a player.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** I, I was so surprised.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** I didn't even know that was even on the table.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:13]** I just was like, cause Vinny and I hadn't planned anything else.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Like the one thing was what would Chuck want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:22]** As the GM, I remember just texting you constantly, just fucking kill Chuck.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Knock Chuck out and run away.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** That's all you got to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:34]** Which was an option that I would try, but that ultimately... There was even some moment where...

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:59]** something i that rolu said to chalk about like you know we can do this and then you know i don't know that i want to let them get away or something and then chalk said what do you mean you don't want to do that and that and that's when i realized like oh like there might be something more here than just rolu and just rolu and chalk so anyway fast fast forward to the very end

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:06]** I was, I, the player was actually relieved that the thing that was like supposed to happen actually happened.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:15]** I was excited that Terme and Choc came with, and I realized that Rolu would still not reveal everything.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:19]** So Rolu had to be a bit cryptic about what he said and sent.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** And then frankly, Will and Benny's reactions were not what I was intending at all at all.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** And I think I'm just committed to the bit, which is that, like, you know, I'm not going to clarify anything that happens.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** I'd rather leave that mystery where it stands.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** And if we come back to it later, then we will.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:44]** But the point is, is that, like, I was like, oh, wow, there are just so many more.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:51]** This whole time was that there are so many more repercussions to this decision and ideas that people have than I even thought about.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Right.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:55]** Because I'm just thinking as Rolo, like, what would Rolo want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:02]** Were you at all thinking during Unknown Treasures as the GM of Will Save?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** I'm curious.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:12]** I know our conversations outside of Unknown Treasures was all this back and forth, all this coded messaging because neither one of us... I didn't want to spoil Unknown Treasures.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** You didn't want to spoil Will Save and Threefold.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** But...

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:30]** When you were in the middle of combat or an RP moment with Rolu, were you thinking two steps ahead and, like, this is going to have repercussions in the main game and write this down because this is going to be important?

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:37]** That's probably the biggest answer I'm going to get.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** That's about it.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** I was fishing.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** I didn't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:47]** There are things that I had to jot down or remember and I have written in random notes that I just...

**[00:24:47 - 00:25:07]** you know like there there are just so many threads to pull and i am just always doing my best to make sure that nothing gets lost there's no errant hair string that doesn't get wrapped up somehow in the end so well uh i guess like as as almost a listener at that point um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** I don't know where the veil fits into.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Here's the story.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** And I'm, I don't know if you're going to clarify that either.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:28]** I don't, I don't know if the veil is strictly like Rolo or if here's also involved with the veil, but they call it the veil of Sears veil of the veil of this year.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Is that what it is?

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Veil of this year.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** I'm just gonna call him the veil.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Cause it sounds cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Yeah.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** The veil for short.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Uh,

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:52]** Yeah, just as a reminder, you know, there is the entity, Baratheon entity, known as Nekral, who is a known clairvoyant predictor of major events in the Pact world.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:59]** And I would say in terms of size, probably rivals Confluence, you know, and the Veil of the Seer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** Confluence isn't like the Jira?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** The governing entity.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Yes.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Wait, there's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** There's an online program?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Yeah, it's like a Jira Confluence.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** It's like Teams.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** No?

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** You don't use it at work?

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Oh, okay.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** No.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:27]** I'm talking about the fictional Baratheon entity, governing entity that governs... I'd have to do a culture check on Confluence then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** I don't know.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Roll a d20.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** Hold on, I got one right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:35]** Oh, I rolled too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** This is a six.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** I don't know what a Confluence is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** yeah, they're, they're just the governing entity as breath is can come together.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** Right.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:50]** And, and join to make super beings, uh, and confluence is the governing entity of Brithita and by extension, Leovar.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** So, and you're saying the veil is above them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:09]** I'm just saying Necrol is another entity, but in terms of size and computing power and the ability to rationalize and think, then Necrol is getting close to that level.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:13]** And the Veil of the Seer, they are the interpreters, right?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** They are the interpreters.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** They do the bidding of Necrol.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Okay.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** So, which hand controls which?

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Who wants what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** It's unclear.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** As a player in threefold, I'm very curious to see when and where this is going to come out.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** That's all.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** That's all I'm going to say.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** But speaking of threefold, I do have this fun little cue card.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** My last cue card...

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:53]** to be geared more towards the pcs of threefold conspiracy but i think it's worth a shot anyway so i'm going to read it as is in threefold conspiracy what questions or clues are you looking forward to getting an answer to the most what do you think will happen next john

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Tell us.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** What do you think is going to happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** The biggest thing that I think that I'm looking forward to is beep, beep.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:04]** And the biggest thing that I really think is going to happen next is beep, beep, beep, beep.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Whoa, right?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** I know.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** It's crazy.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** Yeah.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** And now only you know.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:13]** And now you have that curse of knowledge that you have to play through knowing all that stuff.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You know, it's funny.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** I talked to Finder.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:31]** about favorite books and all the other shout out to all the people who already know the uh the vast pandora's box that is threefold conspiracy in the threefold dm or gm channel on our discord

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** And we just talk about how each book is so interesting and how they fit together.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:43]** So I don't even want to say which book I'm looking forward to because I don't want to bias anybody.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:48]** But I'll just say that I'm just having a good time.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Really looking forward to a lot of cool stuff that's coming up.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:56]** I think the biggest thing that you and I were talking about, Kev, that I'll get transparent on...

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:01]** Is the idea of how much you add in versus how much you keep.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:10]** And when you're being creative, you know, you did a great job and I appreciated what you would share with me and your ideas.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:14]** And, you know, asking if that's, you know, like, does that work?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Is that cool?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** And just the idea that you...

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:29]** You know, I feel, frankly, you know, like there's just some pressure to keep a cool idea going or if I'm going to change something, it needs to be cool.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** It needs to be like, wow, that was awesome.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:39]** And it's an interesting just internal dialogue to work with your own creative self and say, like, well, I think this is cool.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** I think this would be really fun.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** I'm just going to commit to it and go through it.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Right.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:57]** So what I'm looking forward to is I don't want to call it validation because it's not needing to be validated, but I'm looking forward to presenting things that I know are mine.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** and presenting things that I know are the books and talking about it afterwards.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:11]** And, and, and, and hopefully you all like it and hopefully the, you know, you, the listeners enjoy it and just getting to share that and share how everything kind of comes together.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** Like, where is your own stuff?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Where is, uh, the book stuff?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:23]** You know, I've talked to Adam at, uh, STF about that a lot, just asked him different things about APA.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** So,

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** It's an interesting thing to think about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:37]** We kind of touched on it earlier in the show about how when you are GMing, you use the AP as a guideline.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** But the story revolves around the PCs.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:50]** And I think when I was sitting down and reading Unknown Treasures for the first time, that's where I was getting those ideas from.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** I've had you as a GM.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** I respect you as a GM.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** I've played with plenty of other GMs.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** And I think you are the first...

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:26]** gm that i've had that made my characters feel important if that makes sense like i i've played in other games where it was just the game you know and and my character was just dropped in it was almost like a like street fighter you know it didn't it doesn't matter what what player you were you or what character you picked you were gonna do the same thing um but like i you and in in our uh

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:35]** Our D&D game, you opened up our D&D game with letters, handwritten letters that you bought an actual wax seal stamp for it.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Like, and each of our letters was different.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** And it was, I just, it was so deep that like, I still don't know what is...

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:49]** from the book and what is what you took from our characters and what is, you know, added in extra.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** And I think that's going into unknown treasures.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** I felt the same way.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** It was like, I want these characters to have depth to them.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** I want them to have a reason for what they're doing.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** Um, and then I, I want that all to connect back to the main game.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** And so, yeah, I, I tried, I was emulating you is what I was doing.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** And I'll, I'll gladly admit that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Well, I, that, that,

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Thank you.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** I'm just going to say thank you for that.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** I really, really appreciate that.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** And that means a lot.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** And to be clear, I was not fishing for that.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** I was just trying to be transparent about what it takes to be a GM and a player.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:32]** And I'm a big fan of honesty and transparency, especially when it comes to sharing, just so people know, like share as much as you want.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** But that being said, I'll just say it again.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Thank you.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I really appreciate that.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** And you did a great job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Did I read that right?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** That's exactly what you have.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** That's what you had written out for me.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** Yes, thank God.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Okay.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** All transparency.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Oh, God.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Wow.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Okay.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Yeah.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** John wrote the script for this entire show.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Yeah, we've just been reading.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Yeah, it's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** John, thank you.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Thank you so much for joining me.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** Last question I have for you.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:23]** revolving around unknown treasures and threefold conspiracy is there and I'm willing to take off my headphones if you want but I will listen to this interview myself if you do that is there anything that you want to reveal or clarify or release or anything as coded as you want it to be is there anything you want to say right now about either of these shows hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:50]** i have a sticky note i have two sticky notes above my computer one of them says your brain can't picture the negative and which is like a just kind of like oh you should like think about it that has nothing really to do with your fault the other one is towards threefold and gming in general and it just says make choices matter and so i will just say that

**[00:33:51 - 00:34:01]** 99.9% of things in our will save main show matter to some degree.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** There's always going to be a couple of layers.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:14]** There's always going to be something else there, which doesn't necessarily mean it's like wrong or duplicitous, but just there's always something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** It all matters.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** That makes me nervous.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** Thank you so much for doing this interview, John.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** This is actually a surprise interview for everybody that's listening.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:38]** We did not say we were going to release this one because today, the same day that this is dropped, we also dropped out our first recap.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** So make sure you go and listen to that.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** It's a recap for Three Full Conspiracy, book three.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:50]** And also next week, come back because we will have video.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:56]** We'll be on video for episode... Oh, God, don't quote me on this one.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** 70?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Oh, no.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I think it's... Is this it?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I think it's 70.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I think it's 70.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** I think it's 70.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** Episode 70, book three.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** It's the first episode of book three.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** You expect to see our faces as we play.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:17]** Unless you're listening on audio, which we still will keep and maintain our podcast format for our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** And we'll still have our faces.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** You just won't be seeing them, to be clear.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** In case anyone was curious about that.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Or will we?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Or will we?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** It all matters.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Thank you, everyone.
