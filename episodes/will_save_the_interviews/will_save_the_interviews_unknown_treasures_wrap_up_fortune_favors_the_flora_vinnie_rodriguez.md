**[00:00:26 - 00:00:32]** Who literally beforehand, before our clap, was like, yo, why don't we just clap on this beat drop for this song that we listened to?

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:34]** And it was a great idea.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:36]** It was a great idea.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:21]** nah we'll keep it in how are you doing today on this saturday this is real saturday vibes man this is super saturday vibes yeah oh man i woke up at like 9 30 it was good it was real good as opposed to i feel like there's another time that you also wake up that's not oh yeah

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:29]** it's either nine 30 or like six 30 because of, you know, kids or work or whatever other obligations I've said yes to.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:34]** But you know, part of my thing has been like, I'm just going to say no to stuff.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** I love it.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** And so I was like, you know, do I want to go play golf this morning?

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** No, no.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** Do I want to do the dishes?

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** No, no.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** So, you know, I got up, I folded some laundry.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Wow.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Grabbed a shower.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Wow.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** Just sort of like adult light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Adult light.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** Yeah.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Yeah, this is good.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** That's the move when you say no to things.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** It is the move.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** You just protect your peace.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** You have your little plot of land.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:08]** You know, maybe you're going to go out and grow some rutabagas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Yeah, no, I have a terrible green thumb.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** I can't grow anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Also, I don't think I know what rutabagas look like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Really?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Yeah.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** They look like teardrop shaped softballs.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** Teardrop shaped softballs.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Rutabagas.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Root vegetables.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** They're super hard.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** They smell kind of bad, in my opinion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** But the taste, the taste is... Also bad.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Okay, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:59]** i was hoping that that was the the set spike that i was going for it was good yep yeah no they taste about how they smell okay cool yeah great yeah they look like they could kill you if they fell from a tree like a coconut yeah 100 okay i'm sure there is at least one murder in in human history where the murder weapon was rutabaga like dude blood force trauma with rutabaga wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** You know how Americans will joke about putting a bunch of quarters in a sock?

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** Yeah.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:08]** I sort of expect that Eastern European countries joke about putting a rutabaga in a sock.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Wow.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** If you're in an Eastern European country, please confirm.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Please confirm.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** Or deny.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Correct me.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** Or deny, so that way you don't get caught.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Yeah, that's kind of a great idea.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** It sounds like the start of a good murder mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:39]** kill people with some rutabagas cook the rutabagas that night to console you know while the investigators are there you might as well feed them right right man that's a that's a that's a murder mystery plot just that is yeah that i just yeah suck that away in the will save archive


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, just next to a bunch of quarters in Rutabaga, isn't that?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** Big sock.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** Who knows?

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** Maybe we need some more murder mystery in our lives.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** I mean, we already had it.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Maybe there's some more that's coming.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Who knows?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Who knows?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** I don't know.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** There's plenty of mystery.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** There's plenty of mystery.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Let me ask you something.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** Okay.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** A little warm-up softball.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** I'm going to softball this rutabaga to you right now.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** A little warm-up rutabaga, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** A little warm-up rutabaga.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:08]** Sorry, I just pictured you, like, it's like 2 a.m.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** And your wife gets up.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** You're not in bed.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** There's, like, a low light on in the kitchen.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** And it's just you eating warmed-up rutabagas.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** Just sawing away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** It's really hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:49]** what is the music lately that you have been banging to like when you put it on you know that it is just it's gonna be a good time even if it's just you listening this is this is um wow there's been a couple of things lately like lately lately i mean you my jam yeah you already know okay

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:52]** Hardy's The Mockingbird and the Crow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** That's, yeah, it's a good tune.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** It's a real good tune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** Is like, that song, I recently saw the music video for the first time.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:07]** And it's like, it's him off in the woods with a truck and a dog and a Yeti cooler filled with beer and like every single country music stereotype.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:07]** Of course.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:19]** And then like midway through the song, it transitions into this like psychedelic, you know, the woodland animals have like given him this crow.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** I don't know if it's poison or like tincture or transformational drug.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** I don't know.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:33]** But he goes off on this wild trip and there's all sorts of different trippy imagery.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** And then it's his transition into the crow.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:41]** And he comes back in all black with a rocker chain on.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Yes.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:48]** He went from his acoustic guitar to a black hollow body Gibson.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Whoa.

**[00:05:49 - 00:06:05]** yeah so like the transition from country pop to rock was was really neat to see it's also all claymation stop motion claymation you really buried the lead with that one i did

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:30]** um yeah it's a wild video the whole album is great and yes the vibe the vibes are so good it's great like if i'm if i'm having a down morning and i need some more energy i will put that that whole album all the way up between that and the the music video and the song for waiting the truck with laney wilson yeah it was really good um

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:35]** I kind of like the standing up for the little person story.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:41]** And he's like, you know, this is the consequence of my actions, but I would do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:48]** That really went from just some bang and claymation video to something deep.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Yeah, indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** That's kind of the album, though.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:58]** It goes all the way from deep philosophical, ethical, moral questions to like, yeah, we're just going to f***ing rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** I also feel like that's a little bit of Colin.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:07]** Like I feel like Colin has some deep thoughts and then at some points he's just gonna, he's just gonna rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** Yeah.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** We'll have to find out.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** I think, I think he kind of, he did some of that in the troll fight.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:20]** Uh, I think we've spent so little time with him that I'm really like, just like you or any of our listeners.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** Like, I can't wait to see, to spend more time with him, to see what he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:30]** Can you share a little bit more about Colin and just introduce Colin as a refresher?

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** And same with your character in Unknown Treasures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** Sure.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:42]** I'm going to start with the easier of the two, Unknown Treasures, partly because I've spent so much time with Shaq.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:46]** And then I guess we'll talk about Colin for a bit.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** So Chak is a Raxalite.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:54]** Raxalites are sort of the vegetable-based bonobos of the Starfinder world.

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:00]** They're naturally curious and welcoming of new ideas.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** And so Chak was...

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:34]** part of a i don't want to say a political dynasty they were they were middlingly good politicians uh but they remained good people which i think you kind of you can't be a great politician and a great person and so like why not okay um he always had a hunger for adventure and so when the captain found him and made him an offer like of course the answer was yes and i think for check the answer is yes in most situations yeah

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:50]** So, um, as we kind of saw through unknown treasures, but like he, he's sort of always experienced the shelter of, um, his home world and his relatively powerful, affluent, affluent family.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** And so to go from that to the shelter and protection of the captain was kind of a, a

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** logical fit.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** And so he got to see the world without really taking too many risks.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:23]** But when they ended up on Akiton to try to defend the captain's territory, Captain Goldhorn, I think Jack was really like, okay, maybe this could be an interesting experience for me to sort of blossom and grow out of my pot here.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:45]** like is this the opportunity to to to no longer just be a houseplant but to be a real contributing member of this crew and so hilarity ensued he went from completely naive to i think um having learned a few lessons of how the world works for sure

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:49]** He experienced some big wins.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** He experienced the taste of victory.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** And he also felt some big loss.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:04]** The departure of Thaddeus from the rest of the crew, I think, is going to leave a lasting impact on that freaking plant.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Yeah.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:34]** yeah that's Jack love Jack gonna miss that guy who knows that wild freaking I think I described him in his bio as everyone's drunk uncle who decides most of their decisions who makes most of their major decisions by rolls of the dice yes yes yeah it's very it's very accurate who knows maybe maybe Jack will come back someday maybe I hope so I would love to spend some more time with Jack what about what about Colin yeah

**[00:10:35 - 00:11:05]** Colin is I sort of imagine that Jack and Colin are sort of two sides of the same coin where Jack sort of came out of the gate whimsical and got wisened up Colin is the complete opposite so like Colin just as a personality trait Colin is the type that would wash and fold and put away his laundry all in the same day on a vacation on a vacation yeah

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:23]** never excuse me colin never leaves dirty dishes in the sink like everything has its place and its order and everything is um happens for a reason and he he sort of lives in that world of order

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** He comes from a family of philanthropists.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:32]** And so it kind of made sense as his skills in healthcare blossomed.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** He was sort of always naturally gifted toward magic.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:43]** And so like spent most of his younger years trying to understand what that meant for him.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Yeah.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:50]** And it was always kind of presumed that he would do something to give back.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:55]** So he enters the... I wish I could remember the name of the non-profit.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** So he's on a humanitarian mission to Akitan.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:07]** And the next thing he knows, he's waking up in a completely different environment.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** Under a bush that has knocked him the F word out.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** With a bunch of folks and a gigantic rivener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** All staring over you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** He gets dropped right into a fight.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** I mean, according to him, everything is trying to kill him.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** And like, how the F word did I get here?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** So like for someone to go from...

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:48]** Stable, predictable in his element, doing the right things and things that he's best at to get dropped into this now just whirlwind of chaos.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** I think we're going to see Colin start to lose his shit a little bit.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** I am very excited for this.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Me too.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:00]** Because what do you do when your whole world gets shifted upside down and shaken around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:05]** I want to put a quick pause on that because I want to jump back to Chak real quick.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:05]** Okay.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:15]** Chak, at the very end, you mentioned this departure of Thaddeus from the crew and

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:26]** Which is funny because I think of it as Rolu leaving the crew to go do what Rolu needs to do.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** So I'm just curious, what is Chak thinking?

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:36]** You've hinted at it a little bit, but what's the internal dialogue with Chak at the very end?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:41]** And what are you thinking about how everything went down and what's going to happen next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** I think I've been pretty explicit.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Oh yeah.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** I individually and check are deep.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** Like when I think of leaving the crew, right.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:04]** And I think that the difference is when I talk about the crew, I mean like the five of us that came down to Akita, I think when you mentioned Rolu leaving the crew, four of us.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Sorry.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** I kind of think of that unseen hand is the fifth.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** I think when you talk about Rulu leaving, the larger crew of the Caduceus.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:20]** Because I assume that there are more members of the Caduceus than just the five of us in the advanced party.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Oh yeah, for sure.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:48]** i mean chak is is curious i think chak is in this weirdly nebulous like he did the right thing by him and so he's confident in that but still like doesn't know if rolu is trustworthy i think he knows that he has to find out for sure and if he finds out the hard way he finds out the hard way


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:57]** This feels like the corollary with Colin waking up in the bush into a totally different environment.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:08]** This whole, all of Unknown Treasures feels like Chalk's move from the stability into, you know, something different.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Through a decision that Chak made themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Yeah.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I think that's fair.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:21]** He sort of thrust it upon himself where Colin has sort of been thrust into it by whomever.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Yeah.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:27]** Yeah, I think Chak has grown more comfortable with taking risks over the course of the story.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** Yeah.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:44]** and because of that like yeah rolu has has become his friend and like when your friend comes to you and says i i need this you don't ask questions you just do it just as long as everyone gets real comfortable real quick

**[00:15:44 - 00:16:14]** I mean John Mulaney nailed it um the I thought it was really fun to role play to see that conflict role played like as a player and as a character like feeling the tension and also to get to like yeah we've got this let's let's go do the darn thing except for Thaddeus who was like hey please don't yeah hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** That is just like, yeah, that's cool.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** But also he sucks.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:26]** It's like a DBZ scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** It was amazing.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** Yeah.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** That was, that was spectacular.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** I really, and you know, I'm, I'm super curious.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:39]** I would love to see a part two just to like explore that conflict even deeper.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:48]** And also like the antics between Chuck and Rolu and Termadin.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:11]** it's funny in my mind it feels like it feels like it's unbalanced it feels like you need a Thaddeus in there for it all to evenly work out right I'm sure Thaddeus would appear perhaps generally in pursuit but I'm sure he would appear I will move my fingers together


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:34]** yeah in a way that looks to be clear because there are three of us at this table the listener too yes that is not something that we are actively working on until now and i just started a new one note ut2


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:40]** Let's pull the pin out of the three-fold transition here that we pinned up earlier, right?

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:45]** You had talked about Colin starting to lose his ship.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:53]** And we just hinted at maybe some future idea in UT2 where we discover what happens after...

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:59]** Chuck has figured out what happened after you F around to find out, you know?

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Yeah.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:14]** My question to you is, on the piggyback of Colin losing his shit, what questions or clues are you looking forward to the most in Threefold?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:18]** And that could be you or it could be Colin, because I'm sure Colin has a lot of questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Colin certainly has a lot more questions than answers right now.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:28]** I've kind of just as a player and as a person stopped asking questions about threefold.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** You're not going to answer any of them until they happen in the story.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:38]** I'm curious to see if because like there's there's a fair bit of like.

**[00:18:40 - 00:19:09]** skittishness because nothing has been as it seems thus far so like that we've already gone from one ship to another location surrounding said ship and like now we're on a third location that i don't know that i trust these folks to take us to where they say they're taking us to or like what's going to happen

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:23]** Even if they are truly genuine, what else will happen outside of the forces that we now are aware of to just take this whole story completely off the rails?

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:28]** This is Murphy's Law gone completely wrong.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:54]** it's the whole story colin is deeply deeply like colin was already shook by the time we got onto uh stormbreaker void crier void crier yikes colin was was already shook by the time we got onto void crier and so receiving that message on his communicator rattled him at his core

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Hmm.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:02]** Like there were certain parts of his past that he has held as truth and as fact, and that formed him into the person that he is today.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:11]** And one of those pillars, I would probably say the core pillar of his being has been shifted.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:19]** And so I don't know if he believes the message he's kind of, I mean, based on what he's seen in the last, what is it?

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Six hours.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Yeah.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:24]** He's inclined to believe just about anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:32]** But also, it's totally acceptable to question the authority of the message and how truthful it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Because there is no clear sender.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:42]** It's not like, oh, hey, this is a trusted source who would definitely have knowledge of the topic.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Hey, this is your aunt.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Just wanted to let you know.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:58]** If it came from a family figure, you know, that'll be like, hey, I love you.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** How are things going?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** Like says like three things that don't matter.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** And they're like, oh, by the way.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** All right.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** See ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:28]** you're like what uh yeah and even then you would still question the message anyway sorry if you're curious what was in that message i'm happy to share with anyone uh one person has asked me all you've got to do is hop into our discord and shoot me a dm and i'm happy to to let you know what what was said to call


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:33]** Who was, can I ask who the person was who asked you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** I think so.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** I just got to search my DMs.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Nope.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Stand by.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** I think it was Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** I had a feeling it was Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Yeah, it was Finder.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** It was Finder of Paths and Stars.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Yeah.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Just over a year ago.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Wow.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** Yeah.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:58]** So aside from me and Finder of the Past and Stars and John Swan, nobody knows.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** So if you want in on the secret, you know how to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** You know how to get it.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** And on that cliff note, I got to say, is there anything else that you want to share?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:13]** Is there anything else that we didn't talk about or you want to share about the show or Ruta Vegas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** The transition to video is so much more difficult than I thought it was going to be.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:26]** Uh, technical problems are a fact of life when you're trying to do something that you've never done before.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** Yeah.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:39]** And so working through that has been a unique challenge and I welcome it because we're all professionals here and, and friends and appreciate each other's contributions.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:45]** So thanks to you listeners for giving us the opportunity to do something new.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:55]** Thanks to the rest of the cast for being willing to do a whole bunch of new because we've certainly made it more complicated to record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** And thanks to you, John, for putting together a pretty dope game.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I just couldn't like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03
