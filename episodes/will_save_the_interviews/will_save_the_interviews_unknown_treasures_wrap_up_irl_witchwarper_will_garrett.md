**[00:00:55 - 00:00:58]** Truly, when you think about it, what a waste of time.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:00]** The broth gets everywhere.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:03]** The noodles, you have to slurp them.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]** It's a hard life.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:05]** It's a hard life.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** It truly is.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:22]** So, we talked before, and as we have said on the past couple of interviews, this is going to be our segment in between The End of Unknown Treasures and the start of Book 3 of The Threefold Conspiracy, where...

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** We are now currently interviewing all of our players, asking them questions.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:33]** And the question now is I said to Will, I need a warm-up question like a softball.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** And Will was like, hey, why don't we just ask ChatGPT?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** So I'm going to watch stream now.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:43]** And what question should we go with, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** All right.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:51]** So I am asking ChatGPT, what are softball questions for an interview with a castmate?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:56]** This is so... For a Starfinder podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Perfect.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Just ask.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Let's see.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** Dot, dot, blinking, thinking, thinking.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** I was going to say error.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** These are good, but they're not like softball-y.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Let's see.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** None of these are softball questions.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:14]** I don't think ChatGPT really understands what a softball question is.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Softball question is... It's a warm-up.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:19]** Yeah, it's a warm-up question.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:24]** Not like, what aspects of Starfinder setting or lore do you find most intriguing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:28]** What kind of energy or vibe do you think you can bring to the podcast and the team?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** That's like an interview question.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Yeah, man.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** This is like hard stuff.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Yeah.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Wow, this is crazy.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:42]** How do you feel about engaging with the Starfinder community and interacting with listeners?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Also, that's like an interview question.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** That is a real interview question.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** These are not softballs.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I'm going to provide that feedback.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** These are too hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:58]** Please dumb it down.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:02]** Is ChatGPT about to give us more questions?

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Certainly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:08]** Here are some simplified softball questions for an interview with a potential castmate for a Starfinder podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** They're the same questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** They're literally the same questions.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** I don't think ChatGPT knows how to be dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** What do you find exciting or fascinating about the world of Starfinder?

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Wow, that just, yeah, that's not how this works at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** I could answer that question, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Do you want to answer it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Go for it, go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** Is there one that I want to answer here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:41]** Is there a Starfinder ramen flavor from a certain planet or species or culture that you would particularly enjoy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Personally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]** Um, that I'm aware of.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:58]** I mean, I really do want to try the grape Fanta from the threefold conspiracy, but yeah, I don't really delay Vara lush.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Yeah.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** It's meant to be like a tropical flavor.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Oh, I'm all about that, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yeah.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I love the Pog.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** I love the Cactus Cooler.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:17]** I love all things fruit blend juice drinks with a little fizz.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Can't go wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:24]** So far, the food questions really seem to end up being the warm-up questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** Honestly, I only think about food and drink.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:35]** Those are the only thoughts that go through my mind as I'm time traveling through the world, through the universe.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** I'm really just looking for something to eat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** It's a pretty great reason to be a time traveler.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Pretty, pretty great reason.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** You want to jump into some characters?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:54]** Can you tell me, Will, who are the characters that you play in The Threefold Conspiracy and Unknown Treasures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:07]** Well, within The Threefold Conspiracy, I play Dr. Kantu Okadis, who is a Osharu from the planet of Pabak.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:20]** who is engaged in many academic pursuits, namely biohacking as a forefront to his collegiate scholarship.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:36]** Within that, also, he's, as many of you probably know, Pabock is a planet that is effectively tamed through the use of technology, so he's also a mechanic, and

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:52]** He currently is in operation of a sage drone that was bequeathed to him through... Well, I don't know if it was bequeathed, but he recovered it from his long-lost colleague, Aeon Boushtakis.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Dr. Aeon Boushtakis.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:59]** And, yeah, I mean, that's pretty...

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Pretty much it.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** He is, you know, alone.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:07]** A sharer alone is not a comfortable thing.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** And so he's very, I don't know.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** I don't know how much.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** He's just kind of a fish out of water.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:25]** Um, so, um, and he, he obviously like grew up from a sort of, uh, collegiate academic atmosphere.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Yeah.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:36]** I don't know if that plays well in the, the dynamics of the show, but, um, you know, that's, that's kind of his like character upbringing, I guess.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:41]** Um, and so him breaking out of that is, uh, it's interesting.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** So it's an interesting thing to explore.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:57]** Um, within unknown treasures, I play termite in hermidex, who was the, um, boat yeoman chief on a board.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** The, uh, name of Caduceus.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Yes.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** Well, I mean, obviously I know that.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** Um, and wasn't forgetting definitely a moment ago.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Definitely wasn't forgetting.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** Um,

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:17]** Yeah, so, I mean, he's got a long history with Goldhorn, which I guess is another character that I play.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** I think you need to introduce Goldhorn.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** That's fair, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Yeah, totally fair.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** Totally fair.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:36]** Goldhorn is a Naur, which is a sort of a bovine creature known for their, like...

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:54]** memory and, um, affinity for mazes, I believe is within the, like, you know, they're like kind of like a dungeon-y sort of like they're great at pattern recognition, I guess, as far as, you know, a trait of their species.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Um, yeah.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:03]** And he's sort of a menacing figure and he's got glistening gold horns that are, um, you know,

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:33]** he's got a really he's obsessed with gold and riches and being a pirate in the worst ways I think his demeanor yeah I mean I liked portraying him the few times that I have maybe in the future there's more for Goldhorn for Torme there might also be more

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:46]** Maybe, um, there's, um, to me, he's a witch word, which warper, uh, which you can't say five times fast.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:53]** Otherwise, uh, the universe won't blow and, um, or his will anyway.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** Um, yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:02]** So he's, he's kind of an interesting, like which, which words don't have a whole lot of, uh,

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** about them that is known, so it's kind of like...

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** he's a sort of, uh, mysterious figure.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:23]** And one of those qualities, as many, you know, which words have a affinity for being, uh, cloaked both literally and figuratively in, um, in all cases.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:30]** And, uh, yeah, they're thought to be the progenitors of Kasafans and the, um, Shabbat.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** Uh, gosh, Shabbat.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Yeah.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** The, um,

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** The unfortunate...

**[00:09:40 - 00:10:08]** boss at our end of our unknown treasures not to spoil it for i hope i'm not spoiling it for anyone i mean there's definite spoilers we probably should have started with a warning for spoilers i'll add something in that says there are spoilers so it's fine yeah yeah yeah spoilers abound in this discussion i'm sure i'll cut that right there yeah okay spoilers abound in this discussion i'll put that right at the beginning i'll put a lot of reverb it's just like spoilers around

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:34]** As I've come to expect, an incredible level of detail and thinking in all of your characters.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:43]** Well, let's stay on... Interview over, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** That's it, yeah.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:49]** I just asked you about that, and knowing you, that you provide so much awesome stuff that I just get to be like, cool.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** I don't know.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** So, let's stick with Unknown Treasures for a second.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** And...

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:05]** Let me ask, what are three of you thinking at the end of the show?

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** What is Treme thinking?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** What is Goldhorn thinking?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** And maybe what is Will thinking?

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** Feel free to answer as many of those as you like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** I don't know if I want to... Okay.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:25]** Or don't... Yeah, so if it comes up later...

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** then this is going to be a major spoiler.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** Oh, okay.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Maybe.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** I don't know.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** We'll see.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Do I know it?

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Goldhorn is upset.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Okay.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:46]** And he wants an explanation more than anything.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:54]** I don't think that he's necessarily upset with Rolu, but he wants to get to the bottom of whatever is going on.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:13]** as far as um his departure like he feels kind of dis um disrespected and I think yeah I mean you know you give your two weeks notice uh or like at least some notice right uh

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** you don't say like everything's gravy and then just bounce.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:26]** Um, but also, I mean, it concerns him too, that like he's involved with here's and this like rogue pirate ship and like what the heck's going on there.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:32]** Um, so he's, he thinks that there's definitely some explaining to be done.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:43]** Um, he's, he's interested in Treme thoughts on the situation and why Treme left.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:44 - 00:13:06]** because he's close with Treme and well I mean because I was in my own head obviously then playing 40 chess in my own head right now right yeah of course um Treme's thoughts are what is going on much along the same lines um

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** He wants to get to the bottom of it.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** And that's why he pursued or decided to go along.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Now, what happens?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** How far along down the rabbit hole does he go?

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** Does he betray them at the end?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Remains to be seen, right?

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:47]** was kind of interesting because you guys kept me personally this you know this was after it now we're now we're going into like what what was i thinking at the end of unknown treasures yeah i mean maybe the fans know but like i because i think we talked about this a little bit at least in the uh plot armor but i was totally in the dark about what was going on between everyone

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:55]** And I think you, John, Kevin knew, obviously, what was kind of going to play out.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** And then Kelly for sure knew.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:04]** And I think Vinny probably knew.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** He should part.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** Do you want me to share what I think everyone knew?

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Yeah.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Are you curious?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** Yeah.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** I mean, I knew what Rolu wanted.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** It was very clear from the beginning, right?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Yeah.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Or from once that made sense.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** Kev knew that that...

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:46]** was a goal of mine and he knew what a goal of kelly's was right of that yeah but kev also was the gm so he frankly at every like when when rolu was first frozen he like he like he would just message kelly and be like now's your chance or he would message me and be like go get the stone like right like

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** That was it.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** Like, he, of course, can't do anything, so he would just message and say.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:57]** And then Kelly and I talked about, you know, like, are we comfortable with PvP?

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** Or do we, like, what are we thinking, right?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:03]** And then we both kind of agreed, but...

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** We obviously knew what the other person wanted.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:14]** Venny truly was like you in that he didn't know anything other than what we talked about as a group, right?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:20]** There was one phone call that I had with Venny after Chuck had been on Rolo's shoulder.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:23]** And this is not... I'll just say this because I want to get back to you.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Um...

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:30]** And I just asked Vinny, I was like, you know, do you want to know what I'm thinking?

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** And he said no.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** And I was like, okay, cool.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:36]** I just wanted to know in general.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** I said, I'm trying to think about what Shock wants.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:50]** And he was like, and he kind of gave me a clue about like, well, Shock is because I was thinking to myself, how do I get Shock to be in on this?

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** Right.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Because Shock's already there and Shock has the stone.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** So it was just by chance because Shock had the stone that I had to convince Shock.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** So that's, so Benny really didn't know anything.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** I didn't tell him what was going on or what was going to happen next.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** I just was like, what does shock really want?

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** You know?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Yeah.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** Because I, John was having a problem knowing.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** Uh, so that was, that was it.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:19]** So you knew I actually tell tell me what you think.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:27]** I think you were in the perfect position because your decision was entirely based on what everyone did around you in the game.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:31]** There was no foresight other than you knowing about the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:38]** Yeah, I mean, I know Rolu plays a role in Threefold.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:46]** That's literally the advanced... That's the entirety of the advanced knowledge that I had going into those interactions, I think.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Yeah.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** Other than... Yeah, I mean, I'm wanting the stone, right?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:54]** Yeah, I mean, it was cool.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** That's why I think Terme...

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:01]** Would have acted in that way as well.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** Like, I think I played the character true to the character.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** I think you did, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** You had the most genuine reaction of anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:14]** And I think the misfire was just, like, chef's kiss.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** It was perfect.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** I loved that.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Perfect.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** That I picked that and it just worked.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** We did not plan that.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** No.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** So much was not planned.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** And the fate of it was...

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** was in, in the die.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** Like that, we played that exactly as it was meant to be.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** And, you know, anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** And you just, can I ask you, did you think about it?

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:48]** Like as soon as Kelly was like, I'm going to stand up in your mind, were you like, oh, I've been planning this misfire or did you just come up with it in the, in the moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** Oh, I came up with that in the moment.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Oh, it was beautiful.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:52]** Yeah.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** I thought like, okay, so there's a gun drawn.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** What would Treme do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** In a public place.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Yeah.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** What would Treme do?

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** That's perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:07]** And it's innocuous enough where it's not like I actually attacked him.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** Right?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** I just foiled his attack.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** And I think that's exactly how...

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:23]** uh, Terme would try to diffuse the situation, um, between, between his crewmates.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Yeah.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** It's, it's, it's so good.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** You're really great at playing true to your character.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** I mean, I spent a lot of time in their heads.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** It shows.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** It comes through.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Cool.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That was a great answer.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** That was fantastic.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** Let's look ahead.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:46]** Let's move past through the veil and jump into threefold.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** Tell me, let's switch to Dr. Okay.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:55]** What questions are you or Dr. Okay looking forward to getting an answer to?

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** Maybe what do you think will happen?

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** What's your thoughts on threefold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:11]** Yeah, so with Dr. Okay, I think the answers that he's looking for are around...

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:30]** not just where he is, but where Dr. Boushtakis is and what prompted his like departure from Pabak in such a sort of, uh, on uncommon sort of, uh, uncouth way.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:37]** And, uh, he, he has an allegiance to, uh, Boushtakis that I think will be revealed eventually.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Um,

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:46]** as, as part of our sort of like character sort of development in, in our arc.

**[00:19:47 - 00:20:07]** I, I don't want to spoil too much, but, um, I think that, um, down the road, perhaps, um, if there is a reconciliation, there will be a lot of, um, reckoning between them.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:35]** and uh yeah i'll just leave it there it's a big word it's a big word that's great yeah reconciliation maybe yeah reckoning reconciliation of course that's that's what i was gonna say the whole time that's good that's good myself i'm wondering you know to what extent this uh the folds of this conspiracy have been uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:40]** I feel like we're through one fold, maybe.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** It's a good guess.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** I mean, I don't know.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** That was a... One and a half folds?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Half a fold?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I don't know.

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:03]** Like, I don't know how this can... Like, I really have no idea how this story... I have plenty of guesses, but I don't have the slightest idea as to, like, what...

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** Real mechanisms are behind all this clockwork.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Great.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Great saying.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:17]** What are the motives of the villains at hand?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Yeah, I have no clue.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** I don't even know who the villains are.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Who's the man behind the curtain, right?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Is it the greys?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Is it the stewards?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Is it some sort of...

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:59]** infiltration from greys into the stewards is it who knows is it all just a dream are we gonna wake up and we're gonna be like back on uh not absalom but like on uh legacy station uh yeah legacy station like wow we just like ate some bad food and we were hallucinating this whole time that would be that would be like to me it feels like the worst letdown


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** I mean, it could be cooler than that.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** I don't know.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** It would just be like... Do I think our present predicament is...

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Those are great questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:22]** I am very curious to ask you personally what you think, what your theories are.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** But we'll have, who knows, who knows.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:28]** And with that, I'm going to leave us on a question mark.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Thank you.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** The question.
