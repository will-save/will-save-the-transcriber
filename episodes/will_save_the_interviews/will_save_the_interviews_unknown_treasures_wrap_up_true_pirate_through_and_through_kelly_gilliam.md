## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:16]** What's up, everybody?

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:18]** We got another.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:21]** Right as we start, we're going to leave it.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:24]** Right as we start, Kelly's camera cut to color bars.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:26]** The transition to video.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:27]** Oh, it's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:29]** It's been a journey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:30]** It is slow.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:31]** It is gradual.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:32]** It is an iceberg.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:33]** But we're doing it.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:34]** We're doing it.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:35]** We're getting there.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:36]** We're fixing all the kinks.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:45]** But right now, this is on audio only, and I have the pleasure of sitting down with the one and the only Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:47]** That's true.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:48]** There aren't many Kelly Gilliams around.

**[00:00:49 - 00:00:50]** That's true, but you're fantastic.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:52]** Yeah.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:52]** Yeah.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:53]** What's up?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:53]** What's up?

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:53]** That's good, man.

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:54]** How you doing, man?

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:55]** Good, man.

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:55]** Good.

**[00:00:57 - 00:00:59]** You know, I just thought I'd record a little interview with you today.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:00]** You know, why not?

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** It's nice.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:01]** It's nice.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:13]** Just as a reminder, this is our second interview in our series in between the end of Unknown Treasures and the start of book three of The Threefold Conspiracy.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:21]** So, Kelly, we are all very happy and very excited to hear what you have to share today.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** No pressure.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** No pressure at all.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** It's going to be great.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** It's going to be great.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** First question.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** Easy question.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Easy question.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** What anime are you watching?

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:34]** And what is a favorite anime that you're watching right now?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Or that you're looking forward to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** I'm looking forward to Demon Slayer Season 3.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:44]** I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's out more or less completely here.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** For those of you that watch Demon Slayer, it's good.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Demon Slayer.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** My favorite anime of all time is... That's a really difficult one.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:01]** But I mean, you mentioned we were talking like before we did this interview, Samurai Champloo, how you want to finish that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** So the same director and a lot of the voice actors did Cowboy Bebop.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** And that's probably one of the most classic anime ever.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** Yeah, classic.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** Every now and again, I'll watch that, you know, for some inspiration and stuff.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Just to get more into character and get more inspiration.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:31]** there's another really good one called Erased in English it's called Erased it's a really good anime you should check that out too it's like about like some a kid who like kind of like keeps going back to the past trying to save these other kids lives from being like murdered by someone

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:50]** it's really heavy heavy but like he goes back over and over and over to try to like save everyone in his town all of his friends it's it's it's a really really cool story so i highly recommend you check it out if there are any of you anime watchers out there listening i would be down to watch that that sounds fascinating yeah for sure man that sounds like yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** I'm just thinking about it.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:55]** Like every episode you're possibly watching, uh, some intense murder scenes.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Yeah.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** It seems like a lot.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Yeah.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:03]** Do you think that you pull a lot of inspiration for your characters from the enemies that you watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** Uh,

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** No, actually.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** No?

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Really?

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:13]** Because Here's is... I think the inspiration for Here's is slightly Matthew McConaughey for some reason that I can't remember.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:18]** And then a very good amount of Cad Bane, I'd say.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** But of course, he's taken on his own life.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Right.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Style-wise, it's Cad Bane.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** I feel like Here's is slightly a douche.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]** So it's like Matthew McConaughey is kind of like a good inspiration for him in that regard.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** Thaddeus is like in large part...

**[00:03:34 - 00:04:01]** Thaddeus was Shere Khan in the beginning a little bit so no anime at all influenced that yeah amazingly even for your like creativity wellspring when you're thinking of you know when you're improvising I don't know I don't really think about it too much but it's probably it's probably true maybe in combat maybe some of the stuff I do or the way that I play it might reflect like anime combat that's possible yeah yeah yeah yeah I could see that Dragon Ball Z or Full Metal Alchemist or something you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:22]** influenced in the way i described yeah yeah i i was thinking about frog you know the way that you were kevin talked about yeah there was a there was a moment where i remember frog being like and like this just the way that his mouth turned and smiled and blood fell on the floor and you were i think you explained it as if it were an anime

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:50]** oh yeah where they like slowly turn to like the viewer basically and then they like give this like alright I'm done I gave it my all and I sacrificed myself for everyone that's a very common trope in anime for sure yeah yeah him dying was a very like Krillin slash Yamcha slash Goku slash Gohan moment you know wow the lore is deep I love it the waters are deep and they are rich and it sounds lovely seems warm and nice and inviting alright

**[00:04:51 - 00:05:02]** talk about some let's let's talk space turkey what uh uh just just let all the listeners who probably already know uh who do you play in unknown treasures and the threefold conspiracy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:09]** In Unknown Treasures, I play Thaddeus, the Patra, the cat who is a soldier.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:24]** And his role in the crew is he's the weapons officer and a combat specialist who is tactics oriented and does not run away from combat, but strategically maneuvers or tactically maneuvers, I should say, to gain advantage.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Yeah, definitely, definitely.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Yep, for sure.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Okay, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** He's also kind of a chef on the side, you know?

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** He has like a little streaming thing that he does.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Cooking with Thaddeus.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Watch a few episodes.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** There you go.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** What about Threefold?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:42]** In Threefold, I play here as Fabricius...

**[00:05:42 - 00:06:10]** Here is this former pirate, former captain in the Free Captains, was a former pirate and was kicked out for, well, now you'll know after listening to UT, but committing a heist for what he believed to be moral reasons on a very powerful captain, one of the members of the council's personal ships in his armada, his personal armada.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:13]** So he was kicked out for that reason slash had to kind of escape.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:20]** And he's now trying to find his way back into the free captains with Rolu's help from possibly beyond the grave.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** It would seem, you know, with the puck and so on.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:29]** Anyway, he's a technomancer, does like a lot of a lot of magic and kind of our glass cannon, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:32]** Glass cannon is a way to put it, but you can hold your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:55]** you just don't here's here's i think we talked about this here's might have gone to a thaddeus tactics seminar one time yeah so you know here's doesn't always get in the forefront it's not easy when like in the beginning of each campaign in both ut and in threefold when the first engagement you have you get like knocked out by someone which happened in both years in thaddeus's case pretty much it's not then it's not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:25]** very encouraging to be like cool like i'm i don't have enough like ac to like withstand these kinds of like grab you know like physical up close attacks so yes i need to like stay back you know i got you it's okay it's okay yeah i i actually truly think it's really tactical and it's it's hard when you're playing a game and especially in the first engagement you're like great my character went down like it is not fun to go down you're like you're worried about it you're worried about it then it happens you're like okay cool guess i'm just sitting waiting

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** you know, trying to get an RP, spend an RP to come back up.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Precisely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** Which I don't like spending resolve points when you don't need to.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Those 10 minute rests, I don't like to take them that much for this reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** But yeah.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** I'm curious, because as you...

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:46]** Do Technomancers, as you gain level, start to gain feats where you can spend an RP point?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:59]** I truly have not played enough characters to know, and maybe our listeners will, but I feel like across all the classes, a lot more of the abilities, they become more powerful, of course, but also there's a greater cost, like spend an RP point and you can do this really cool thing.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Is that the way for Technomancers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:07]** There is such a thing, I think, but I I'm looking at hero lab right now and I can't pull it up.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:17]** I think that very likely I remember coming across them and I probably did not pick it up because I, I'm kind of conservative with this stuff with like the economy in that regard.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:20]** Like, uh, I don't like to spend RP point, uh, result points.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** So I probably aren't taking those unless they're really, really good, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** I mean, your pool of RP does go up, but overall... It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** I think now I might be more into it.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** But in the beginning when you have like three to five, it's like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** Going down once can almost take you out, right?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** Because you have to spend one to stabilize if no one stabilizes you and then one to get back up.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:50]** Plus there's that rule in Starfinder that maybe you brought up where it was like, you know, hey, like there's a way where if you're down and even if you have a lot of resolve points, you can kind of be instantly killed.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** There's some like weird little loophole right in Starfinder where...

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I don't want to go down because I can't remember exactly what it is.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** But basically, if you're down in Starfinder, it's really dangerous.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** If you're down and not stable?

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** I can't remember, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** That's okay.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** Yeah, we'll look into it.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** It is dangerous.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:14]** I mean, yeah, if you take your points up to a certain amount, you can die, right?

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:21]** Which is typically why you only choose to attack players who are down if it really fits the character.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** Or else it's just, frankly, an a**hole thing to do.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** You know?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Exactly.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** Let's cut to someone who might do that.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Thaddeus.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** Question.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** What is your character thinking?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** What is Thaddeus thinking at the end?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** And what are you thinking?

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:51]** And I have to say, this question, I'm most interested in your answer for sure in that you are not with the three other characters and you are actively working against them.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** And you brought in this whole... Okay, anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** Oh, the narrator thing?

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** Yeah.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:02]** I mean, to Thaddeus... I mean, Thaddeus feels really upset, to say the least.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:08]** I mean, he knew because the narrator, the Commodore, placed him on the Caduceus.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** He kind of knew that Rollu likely was involved because he was briefed on that.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:20]** But to see Shaq and Termay go with Rollu off into Rollu's weird adventure...

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** from his perspective, it's, it's really, uh, it's really disheartening for him.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** This is a crew that he's known for a little while now.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** And, um, yeah, it feels like a personal betrayal for sure.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Wow.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** He's very upset.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** You could tell like when you're ready, he was not happy.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:39]** No, he really wants to go and chase Rolu.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** That's what he wants to do right now.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** And he says that to the narrator.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** He's like, look, um, I can help.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** I can help out.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** And, uh,

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:54]** But for reasons which are not revealed at this point, he's not going to just go against what the narrator's wishes are.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** And the narrator wants him to be on the Caduceus for reasons for the time being.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** So that's it.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** But maybe in the future he can come and get Rolu.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** And Rolu can get his comeuppance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** We'll see.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Yeah, we'll see what happens.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** Do you think that...

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** This question might put you on the spot a little bit because it wasn't in our list of prepared questions.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Sure.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:26]** Do you think, or is there anything you can share about what that, what would Thaddeus do next?

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** Like what's like the next six months to a year for Thaddeus?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** And I just thought of this.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:36]** So feel free to be like, I don't want to share anything that I don't feel comfortable saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** Broadly speaking, like Thaddeus is going to be

**[00:11:41 - 00:12:03]** working in the shadows he's going to be doing stuff for the narrator because right now the narrator is super focused on getting hears and getting his revenge and that also includes getting rolu there's and and other members of the of the naves revenge that ship right that that clue so that could be shira dawnbreaker and some others

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:08]** So he's going to be helping in, in ways that he can do that.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:15]** But for the time being, it's going to be on the Caduceus because there's some more stuff he could do there, uh, to, to help the narrator out.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** So he's kind of acting a little bit like a spy, kind of like Rolu in fact has, you know?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** So, yeah, sure.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Definitely.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** For six months.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** And then, you know, the cooking show, you know, he'll keep doing that, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Yeah, what if the cooking show takes off and he tells the nader, he's like, hey, I want out.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** Classic gang story trope, right?

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** You know, like, you're like, there's one person who always wants out.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** And maybe... I don't... Maybe we find that he's wanting out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** No.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** He... This is what he's best at.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** He's a good cook, but he's... He loves... He's a better killer.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** Well, I mean, if we're talking...

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** I don't know how many times he hits when he does hit.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** Like it tends to, uh, that's true.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** Like I said, I don't like being a soldier, but there you go.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** Well, that's also, you know, there's, there's some part of the story and the dice.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Yeah.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** The dice.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Yeah.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** They are capricious.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:08]** The dice are, they, they are capricious looking ahead.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Let's, let's, let's jump to the other side of the coin.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Uh,

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:19]** What questions or clues are you or Hears looking forward to getting an answer to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** What the hell the puck does, basically.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** Like, why is it going to help him get back into the free captains?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** I mean, he assumes that we're talking Hears, right?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Yeah.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Or you.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:38]** He assumes that, you know, somehow it's going to help vis-a-vis the council in some way.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:45]** Like, because there's no other way really to get back in except to, you know, them to allow it.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** So, you know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** So he wants to know that.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** He also wants to know, of course, what's going on with this like threefold conspiracy.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** For sure.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** He wants to know...

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** Kelly wants to know what Rolu's actual fate is.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Oh, okay.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** You can cut this if you want and you may not need to because I could totally be off.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:13]** But like, I wonder if like, is Rolu actually alive at this point in the timeline when we're in book three, now moving into book three?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:21]** Rolu being a precog might have did something, engineered a situation such that he might not actually be dead.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** I don't know.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** So that's what I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** I like that.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** It's a good question.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** It's a question that I have some answers for.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** The end answer to.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Probably.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Yeah.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:36]** And I can't share it now, but I'm very excited to share it with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** For sure.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Okay.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Yeah.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** I'm excited to share some things as well, by the way.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** What more do you have?

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Nah, it's fine.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Another time.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** You should.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** You have to wait some time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** We're all trying to coordinate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:55]** We're all working together and not telling each other all the little details at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:59]** We probably should talk about that, but that's okay.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:09]** Anything else that you want to share about or that you want to share with our listeners about Threefold or UT or you or your characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:38]** hmm that was so pensive i i don't i don't know i i just want to remind the listeners that there's there's a lot to come when it comes to the extended universe that we're putting together or we'll save in the extra galactic yeah enter yeah all of that uh there's like there's more to come so those story threads will you know some of those things will be carried throughout and you know um that's all i'll say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:46]** Yeah, I have a feeling whenever you jump into the hot seat, there's going to be a lot of Easter eggs and cool things that you'll share.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** I'm sure it's going to be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** Are we doing that?

**[00:15:49 - 00:16:01]** This might be more of a question just for you directly, but like, are we, we could do that after, cause I know that we did book one and two and then UT, we could do it after three and four or after three or I don't really care.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** I just didn't know.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** I said after three, but I didn't want to, I didn't want to interrupt your plans.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** I realize now that sometimes we connect books, you know, before we move on to some other stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** Honestly, I think it's okay for the listeners to hear this.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:20]** We're pretty transparent about our goals and trying to be able to tell a lot more stories.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:33]** And I think the big thing is what makes sense with our resources and our time and what can we do sustainably and in a healthy way for all of us, right?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** So I would love for you to be able to even start telling that story

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:50]** before the end of book three or maybe right as yeah like right after book three but book three and or book four and yours at the same time like maybe that's something that we look into or yeah we split it up

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** And do it one at a time.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** I don't know.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Check out our coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** Yeah, soon.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** When it goes up.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** And if it's already up, yeah.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:11]** Yeah, eventually we might be able to get to the point where we have enough support to do concurrent stories.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:17]** Because we want to do high quality stuff when it comes to audio, video, content, whatever.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:20]** So we spend a lot of time doing it, which is why we don't do concurrent shows.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** Because we want to give everything its due attention.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Exactly.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Plus we have lives we have to live, obviously.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:30]** So if we have to worry less about the other stuff in our life, we could do more of that.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** So that would be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:54]** that would be cool it's just fun like it's it's really it it was really fun with kev yeah and kev had a good time i think being like well this is how much i can tell you and now i'm looking forward to doing that with you and you're like well this is how much i can tell you about this story i'm like okay cool it's you both it's yeah yeah both very good gms i'm looking forward to it for sure dude and you're you're gonna be awesome you're gonna be great

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Is it anything goes?
