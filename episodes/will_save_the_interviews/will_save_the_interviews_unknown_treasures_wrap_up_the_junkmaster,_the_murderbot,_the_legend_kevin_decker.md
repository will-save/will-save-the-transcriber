**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** It's nice to watch people as they act and laugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** I know.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:44]** It's a little frustrating for me because I actually got to get dressed and clean up a little bit.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** I can't just roll into the studio and hit record.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:50]** I got to be presentable.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** So I might not be wearing pants still.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** I want to point that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** That means that I'm going to text your wife and be like, Kevin, come here real quick.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:03]** And then you'll run out and we'll get video of you just running out.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** We already have the pod set as explicit, even with the beeps.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** So we'll just add to that.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** It's fine.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** It's cool.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** All right, so we got a couple interview questions.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Let's jump in.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** We also got a little warm-up question.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** We're going to warm up.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:27]** My warm-up question for you, Kev, is what was the most recent food or beverage that you really enjoyed?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** And I mean you're like floored.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** You're like, this is ambrosia.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** I need this again in my life very soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** Okay, yeah, I live in Maryland.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Okay, that is a place.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:50]** And the sushi here is not comparable to other places I've lived, like Hawaii or California, or places I've visited, like Japan.

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:03]** But there is a place locally in Old Ellicott City called Umi, and I took my family there with some friends, and yeah, it was the kind of sushi I expect.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** when I go to a good sushi place.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** I was very, very pleased with it.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** I had, I forget what the, so back in LA, there's a place called Tacoro.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** I'm sure we talked about this.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:20]** They have a mountain roll that is like a spicy tuna roll with a, it's just a ton of like spicy tuna with chef sauce and whatever sauce is on top.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Really good.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** My favorite roll.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** This place had a mountain roll.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** It was different.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:28]** It was a deep fried roll that had sushi.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:33]** It was spicy tuna with the same like sauces on it, but it was deep fried.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Oh, it was so good.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** That sounds great.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** That sounds very tasty.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:44]** I thought for a second you were going to say, you know, there's this little mom and pop shop here in Maryland.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It's called 7-Eleven.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** And here's a fun story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** My neighbor is actually like head chef for a local grocery chain.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** And like the guy is a professional chef.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** And we went out drinking one night and we ended up at the tavern, which is just down the road.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** And he was like, man, I love I love 7-Eleven hot dogs.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** And we all left.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** And he actually went to 7-Eleven and got a 7-Eleven hot dog.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** And I was like, man, I'm with you on that.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** But like, I don't want one right now.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** But this professional chef, his thing is 7-Eleven hot dogs.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** And I'm like, yeah, I got you, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I am surprised that you didn't want one.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** Surprised that you didn't want to get that glizzy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** It was 2 a.m.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** I was ready to go to bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Yeah, we do know how 2 a.m.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Kevin is.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:33]** But I have to say, when Kevin would come over in downtown L.A., I mean, we lived above a 7-Eleven.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:40]** And just every time that you came over, whether it was to watch the cat or play a game or do homework or something, you would walk in.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** You'd be like, hold on a sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** It's because the 7-Eleven was in your building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** It was like, get a hot dog every time.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** It was in your building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:53]** And they have a rewards point system that I was like, I'm going to get my next hot dog for free.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** I'm just working up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** That was great.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That was good.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** That was a good time.

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** Good time.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Cool.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** All right.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** Let's jump into the real content that people want to hear.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** Although some people like the banter.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** I love the banter.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:07]** It's good.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** It's good.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** It's all banter to me.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** It's all banter.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:11]** Life is banter.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** Tell me, Kev, just give a little quick intro.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:22]** Tell me what characters you play in The Threefold Conspiracy and in Unknown Treasures.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** Who are we talking about today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Okay, I'll start with the easy one.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:32]** In Threefold Conspiracy, our main show, We'll Save the Podcast, I play the android Rick19.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Do you want a little bit of history on him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:40]** However much you would like to give and share with our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** I think some of the things we've revealed so far is that he is from Akitan.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** He has a family.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** He has a wife and kids.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** And he wants to get back to them.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** He misses them dearly.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** That's all we kind of know.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Okay.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** We all know what that means.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** I think that's about it.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** That's all I'm going to give you.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Okay.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Oh, we did forget.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** He is a part of the android abolition front.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Yes.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:08]** At least he is an up and rising member of that organization because he is an android who is trying to free other androids.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:17]** And that is actually where we opened the adventure is he was tracking down a slaver, somebody who captures androids and accidentally killed them.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** I'm going to say accidentally.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Yeah.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:25]** Because every murder Rick has ever done has been accidental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** You heard it here first.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** You heard it here first.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** Rick19 admitting to murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Accidentally.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** It's more like manslaughter, right?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** So he's a manslaughter bot, not a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, it doesn't really flow off the... All right, what was the other part of that question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** No, sorry.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Yes.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** What character did I play in Unknown Treasures?

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:54]** I played Riddle and the bus driver and the pilot for the shuttle.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** And I played the... Michael.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Kefauk dog guy, Michael.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Oh, yeah, Kefauk dog dealer.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** I played the random market person.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** I played Snake Boy, which you guys loved.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** St.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Louis is fantastic.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:15]** Merkle, Kesh, the seven other Keshjis that we talked to, the other 14 goblins, Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Asshole Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:20]** Vari 13, Tez Tronin, all the true warriors.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:26]** I think the few characters I did not play were...

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:47]** i'm just kidding so i was the gm that's that's the point i ran the show it should have only taken 13 weeks i'm going to stop apologizing for that yes thank you i think it turned out great i really love the way that show finished in the end it was like chef's kiss those last three episodes where we brought in uh jason keely he played dotrulu the big bad guy and then

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:54]** We finished off with such an emotional roller coaster that I had no idea what was going on the entire time.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** It was great.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Absolutely great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:07]** It was just the best exercise and enjoyment of trust between everybody, where we all had some basic things that we might understand between certain people and not.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** And then we were just like, record, let's go.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** And we all trusted each other to take it to awesome new places.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** I'm going to actually edit that.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** I didn't trust any of you to do anything.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** I had it all written out line by line.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:23]** You guys were like, it was great.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** I enjoyed it.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:29]** I literally sat back and watched you guys work through everything.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:36]** It was fun for me to watch as the GM, and I'm sure it was great for our listeners as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, that is one of the pleasures, I think, of being a GM is when at a certain point you just turn off.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:48]** You just lean back and you're like, the players got this because they're awesome.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:53]** Let's stick with Unknown Treasures real quick before we pivot to our next thing.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** And I wanted to ask, as the GM,

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:04]** What were you thinking in terms of what happened at the end, the story and the plot that's set up?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:11]** What are your personal thoughts about what might happen or how do you feel about that resolution?

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** We'll call it.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:24]** And maybe how do some of the characters that you played, is there anything that they might in their own world or is related to the four player characters?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:28]** Yeah, okay, so as a GM, again, I think we talked about this in Plot Armor a little bit.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:32]** Unknown Treasures, I hate to call it a throwaway, but it was.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:37]** It was supposed to be a fun side story that was supposed to be quick and easy.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:44]** And the whole point of it was, we know that Hears gets this puck from Rolu as he dies.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:48]** And so I wanted to explore how Rolu got that puck and what it meant to Rolu.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:52]** So that was the whole point, was Rolu gets the puck, and at the end he leaves the puck and he delivers it.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:56]** I thought it was fun also to explore the pirate aspect of it.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** And so I threw piracy on you guys and I was like, you're each pirates.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** You're stuck with that.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** And I love the way that turned out.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** The characters you guys made, phenomenal.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** I want to know more about them.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:15]** But the characters that I played, I think you guys really changed the world on Akiton, at least in Kavon Depot.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** Riddle was losing her business, right?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:27]** The true warriors had taken over that town, shut her down, and had people locking their doors, and you eliminated them.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** The other character's Michael is basically a freed true warrior.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:42]** He is now a member of Riddle's organization and no longer a gang member out there intimidating people.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:46]** He's now protecting people as they explore the junkyards.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:54]** Merc and Kesh had so much stress about trying to keep their two communities from killing each other.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:59]** And now their communities are combined and united.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:06]** It's just the entire the entire area around Fog Depot is so much better now.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:30]** now that it's under pirate rain than it was under gangster rain uh it's just it's a very interesting twist uh definitely changed my perspective on the four characters that did this event and i'm i'm very curious i know this is up to you john of like what will happen in kafak depot in the future you know where where's that going it'll just get blown off the face of akaton that's fine yeah it'll cease to exist

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:35]** And then last thing is the character that changed that I made.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** I only created a few characters in this game.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:48]** And one of them was X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X,

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Oh, my God.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** I can't remember her name now.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Oh, yes.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** I need to pull up my notes.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** The Grey.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** I introduced a Grey to the series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:05]** And that was mainly to link in what was going on with Threefold to this, to Unknown Treasures.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** But that Grey became a character to me.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** She existed in my world.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:17]** John, you can retcon all of this, but to me, that poor Grey,

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:24]** was a very young Grey during their first adventure out into the world.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:31]** And that was when they boarded the Stellar Flare and caused it to crash land on Akiton.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:37]** And I think in my mind, the Grey was kind of MIA and lost completely.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** to the rest of the Greys.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** I think she was forgotten.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** And for her, she was so young that she knew nothing of that.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** And so she was stuck inside that Stellar Flare for almost 300 years.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:56]** And her only goal was to get back to her home, to the Greys that left her.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** And it's sad to me.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** It's a sad story that she never made it, that she never even got contact with them.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** But I leave that open to you, John, to do with whatever you want.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Sure.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** I'll do nothing with it.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** But yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** That was a great...

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:38]** twist do you i mean you and i were in communication throughout with both of us being like hey i have this question and the other one being like i can answer it to a point and then i can't say anything and that was one that so what does the park do it kind of does this can i put graze in no uh yeah so that was a that that was a great twist that i enjoyed and then the other one was the narrator which i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Totally by surprise.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** I love that aerator.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** I love that aerator so much.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** I know.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:53]** And it was funny because Kelly and I were talking about everything that's happening with Thaddeus, and it wasn't until the last few weeks before we recorded that I was like, yo, what if we create this other character?

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:58]** And he is a part of the Council of Free Captains.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:04]** His ship... And Kelly was like, yeah, his ship is the one that was rated by Hears, and I was like, oh, this is so good.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:08]** And I was like, what if you do the same voice that you do for the intro and the outro?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** And he was like...

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** That's so good.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** So, yeah, now the narrator exists in our world.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** And I think he's such a supervillain.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:20]** He's just a massive evil that is, you know, just alive in the universe.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** But he's like a shadow character.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** Like, he exists and is pulling strings that nobody knows about.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** Not even the main GM of our main show.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Surprise, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:38]** I love it when a villain leaps out of the screen and starts to live in the world that you're in.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Good stuff.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** Let's use that little transition piece there.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:50]** So let's look ahead to threefold conspiracy, which I have to say quietly because if I say it loud, then they'll know because they're listening.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Wait, who will know?

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:59]** Kev, what questions or clues are you or Rick19 looking forward to the most?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** What do you think is going to happen?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:08]** And feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like if you want to save it for July 26th.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** I mean, I'm so torn on this.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** I am so torn.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** I love Threefold so much.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I'm so glad we're getting back to it.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:20]** And I think that's one of my biggest regrets about Unknown Treasures is that we took so long from playing Threefold.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** It was great.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** I know it was, and I loved every second of it.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** But at the same time, I'm ready to get back into it.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:29]** I'm so ready to put Rick's shoes on and play again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** Are they Rick's shoes or are they the shoes of somebody that Rick murdered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Rick doesn't steal.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** Okay.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** Continue.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:50]** Um, no, so I think, and it's funny cause I'm trying to play that line of like, I think Rick really, right now they are aboard the void crier and they, they left, uh, outpost Omicron and watching it implode or disappear.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** What the hell happened there?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** And Rick is just, he's lost.

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:23]** the everything you know about rick doesn't add up everything everything i know doesn't add up you know it's he he was from acuton and has a family and now all of a sudden he is aboard a gray ship or ship that was like taken over by the grays and used as some kind of creepy experiment and they escaped all the experiments and then they ended up on top of the stewart on the stewardship and and i think rick rick really admires the stewards

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:28]** To them, they are a global force, a galactic force of good.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** That they do nothing wrong in that sense.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** And I think he actually, at some point in his life, aspired to be a steward.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** This is good.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** This is good.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:43]** So I think for Rick, it's going to be really hard to convince him that these stewards are bad.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** But Kevin, on the other hand...

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** I am so suspicious of everybody on board that ship.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:54]** The only reason Rick got on there, from my perspective, is to survive.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:59]** And Kevin's ready to tear that place apart and verify the truth.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** But I know Rick won't.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Find out.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Find out.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:08]** I guess the only other thing is, again, I still don't know when...

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** And Rick doesn't know it either, of when they were taken over.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:20]** At what point did his life as it was become the story of Threefold Conspiracy?

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:33]** And I think a part of that answer that tells us like, oh yeah, the ship was actually captured at some point and then put into the facility while everybody was on board.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** The question with that is then who's doing that and why?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** And I know we have four more books to go through to get that answer.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** But we'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** We will get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:50]** I think the last thing I have to say about Rick is that I'm super excited to explore who he is.

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:00]** And I just want the listener to know that there is so much more to him than the surface.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** You only know Rick Skindy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** And with that,

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:14]** Thank you for listening to We'll Save the Interview, Rick 19 edition.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** We will see you on July 26, or rather, you will see us.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** That was very lame, but I like it.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** That was so good.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I'm going to leave it in.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Thanks, y'all.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Thank you so much.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:30]** And thank you, Kev, for sitting down for this awesome interview.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Thank you.
