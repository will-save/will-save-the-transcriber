**[00:00:32 - 00:00:35]** I'm so happy to be a caster again.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:39]** So happy to play alongside Kevin again.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:43]** It's going to be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:48]** We get to find new and unique methods to give Kevin s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:50]** Or you could just not give him s***.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:51]** That'd be cool too.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:51]** Please.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:51]** Nah.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:52]** Nah.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:53]** You start it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:54]** You start it, Kevin.

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:57]** It's always good to get into it with your hickiness about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:57 - 00:00:59]** Kev, you've been around long enough to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:02]** Now the rants can begin on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:03]** Right?

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** It's cool to see John back in the GM seat.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:11]** It's like going back to familiar, cozy home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:15]** I'm excited to see the shoe on the other table which has turned.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** The revenge on Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:21]** That was like four crushed into one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:26]** I love seeing shoes on turntables, man.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** It's so nice.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** You guys ready?

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** I want you to close your eyes.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** Oh, I'm so excited.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:39]** Imagine that it's night aboard the Voidcrier.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** It's quiet

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:55]** The running lights are low, illuminating the hallway floor as we slowly move along a dark corridor to see a door at the end, metal.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:09]** We move through the door and see the vastness of space and the drift outside three bay windows in the cozy galley.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:21]** On the right up near the window are our four characters sitting on stools across between the bar and the window.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:26]** There's one light on above the kitchen across the room.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** And these four characters are deep in conversation.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:38]** Drinks, maybe a couple snacks they found in the cabinets, and hand.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:50]** Our characters that we know and love, Dr. Okay, Rick19, here's Fabricius, and Colin Edenbrint.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:03]** I just realized that we have not had an opportunity to fully brief you on the events that have been leading up to your discovery, Colin.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Aye, that's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** Yeah, Colin, you did kind of just get thrown, you know, right into the fires of it all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:22]** Yeah, you woke up pretty close to, I don't know, the end of our adventure on that hellscape of a place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** Hellscape is a great description for it.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:34]** That was, you know, waking up in a bush and then fighting a radioactive troll was... Wow.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Certainly the craziest thing I've done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** Alongside our mate...

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Frog, rest in peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Rest in peace.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** And Colin, like, crosses himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:53]** He just takes off his enormous oversized hat, brings it to his chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** He, like, knocks something off the counter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:59]** It's over a few cuffs, yeah.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** I gotcha.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** Ah, thanks, man.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** You're literally a lifesaver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:15]** This is a struggle, because I'm so excited, but Colin is so reserved and prim and proper, and I don't know how I'm going to play this.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Is he?

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Cool.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:22]** Perhaps, Rick, your memory may serve him better.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:33]** If you want to recall, we can fill in some color, but I think you would probably be best to recount what all happened over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** I appreciate that, Dr. Roque.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I mean, I've seen some hills that we've gone through.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** What happened before that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** Here, let me take care of this for you.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:52]** And he pulls up an image from his comm unit, pushes a button, and we'll save the podcast.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Pops up.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Bucks wanted to.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Pushes play.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** Put ourselves in our own universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:17]** Um, uh, from my recollection, you, you claimed that you, claim is the wrong term.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** I apologize for that.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** But you said that you, you were on Akitan.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:29]** No, you were, yes, you were on Akitan and then woke up in the bush.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** Something occurred that, that placed you there.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** There is an absence in your memory.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Aye.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** For us, we did not all share that experience to get where we were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Colin looks very surprised at this revelation.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** Hey, how did you find yourselves in that room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:56]** Well, it started, I think, the first time that we all gathered in one place was at Legacy Station.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:02]** We were all boarding the same transit ship back to Absalon Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** GM question.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** Would Colin recognize Legacy Station?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Culture check.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Roll a culture check.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** I don't... Okay, stand by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** I don't have my character sheet, Paul.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** I don't know.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Are we playing Starfinder?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** What's a character sheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** Y'all have character sheets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** What is a character sheet?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** I really have no idea how to do this because we're not in Foundry.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** I can't pull up that character sheet.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** I don't see it in Roll20 anymore.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** You don't have a Hero Lab?

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** Hero Lab.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Thank you.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** It's been too long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Wait, didn't you use Hero Lab for chalk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Hashtag unprepared.

**[00:06:54 - 00:07:20]** everything was handwritten for shock yeah it was it was all bad boy again crayon and eyeliner amazing um i'm bringing my massive okay cool cool cool cool culture check for for colin to recognize oh that is a sexy looking die my dude yeah this is dr okay's die i love that what is it okay i might as well reveal like can you tell me the description of the colors that i'm seeing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Of my dice?

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** Yeah.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** How do you describe that?

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** For all the audio, yeah, for all the audio listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:37]** For all the audio listeners, it is a sort of amethyst pink with glittery gleaming green sort of within it.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** It's beautiful.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** In gold letters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** And it says yeet.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** I believe I used those dice at Gen Con.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** And f***.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** They are super sharp, too.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** It's very sharp.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** They literally hurt.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** You can stab someone with those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Wow.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** So that's a four on the die for eight total culture.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** You've never heard of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:09]** I forget where exactly in the system, but we were on our way to Absalom, I believe, was the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:13]** If I remember, and this sucks because Rick has a perfect memory.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** Kevin does not.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** But I think Legacy Station is somewhere in the Viscarium.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Nothing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** That was a question for Jordan.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I know.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I was quiet on purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I just listened to that episode.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** I'm pretty sure it's the Vescarium.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** I just wanted confirmation on that.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Anyways, okay.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** Legacy Station, it's an arbitrary station at this point.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Definitely not.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Well, I guess it might matter.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** I don't know.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:50]** Anyways, we were all about to board the Starliner, the Chimera, which, in retrospect, should have been alarming.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** We were all...

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** just based off of the mythological creature for which the name comes from.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** We'll get to that in a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** What sort of mythology are we talking about here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:15]** We were heading all to Absalon Station, and as we were all gathered at the docking bay, there was a steward, a special agent LaRue, starting to question the passengers prior to boarding.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** And as she did that, a Kasathan attacked her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:24]** Wait, did she, she sounded a bit nasal and...

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** A bit like this.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Do you know Agent LaRue?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** Does Colin know Agent LaRue?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Does Colin know Agent LaRue?

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:32]** No.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:43]** She's from those knowledge-based recordings from the non-profit I worked for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Interesting.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** What non-profit's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** Humanitarian from...

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Absalom.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** HFA is what we call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** Okay.

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:00]** It took a while for that to kind of come to the front of your mind there, but I mean, we did go through some stuff, so I'll just chalk it up to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Yeah.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** What's your class?

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** We're about four of these deep, you know.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** He's a mystic.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** Sometimes the recollection is a bit slow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:16]** I thought it was part of, like, Sarenrae's Without Borders or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Is that Will or is that Dr.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** O.K.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** What?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** I've never heard of such an organization.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** I only know of certain ravens without borders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** Boy, that's probably our biggest competitor.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** Fair.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:43]** As much competition as there is in non-profit humanitarian efforts.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** All right, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:51]** Well, it was during that combat that we first got to know each other.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:57]** After that, we boarded the ship, and it wasn't long before things became very eventful.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:10]** We met a Professor Benjam, and he had a special cube that he was showing off, and when he dropped it, it released several large space lice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Yuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:34]** gross and it was during that that second combat that we actually melded together as a unit and the four of us realized that we were allies at least in what was going on the enemy the enemy of my enemy is my friend is that uh well when you're trying to enjoy a salt-free snack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** And then space lights keep coming in.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Then, yeah.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Right?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Not a big fan of salt, are you?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** No.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** No, no, no.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Good to know.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:51]** And you see Colin actually, like, write it in his notebook.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** No salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:59]** It was not long after that that the professor told us about something precious he had in the cargo bay.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:04]** And as my perfect recollection, there was only one cargo bay.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** Until there was two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** Yeah, it was really confusing.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** The magic of something.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:17]** I guess the Chimera is a tricky, tricky mistress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:24]** Yeah, and then again, this whole journey has been really strange, so I guess it sort of drags.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:30]** I know magic, but to create a whole second bay in a ship is... I know.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Unknown.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** It's impressive.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** Was that you, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** That created magic?

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** I do not know the first thing of magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Okay.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:48]** The trip soon began to unravel, and that is when things got very strange.

**[00:12:48 - 00:13:02]** There was a group of goblins and a barcast that was in the form of a hobgoblin, and there was a security officer that went missing, but we know that she was associated with a Vesk that was also on board.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** And it turns out my suspicions were correct, that this Vesk

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** was not a kind person.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** That's why I shot him first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** Oh, yeah, by the way, Rick is really, really, really bloodthirsty.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:20]** I don't know if you noticed yet, but you will find out very, very soon.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** It's got to be coming around a gag with us, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:26]** It's useful, but it's also kind of weird.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Let's be honest.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** They had it coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:49]** i attempt to de-escalate every situation but i am also very efficient at finishing you notice colin looking to dr okay and here's for confirmation of that statement

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** You're the murder of the bot model.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Got it.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** See, it's so perfect.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** Everyone independently comes up with that.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** It exactly describes the situation.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** I like you, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Grown on me.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Many thanks.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** You catch on quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:17]** As I was saying, this is a very condensed timeline, but there was also Astrazoans aboard.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:22]** We found this later during an attack from pirates.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** I will return to that thought.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:30]** We realized that the captain was not the captain at some point.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** And Astrazoan had placed themselves in the captain's position.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** An astrozoan is a small shapeshifter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** You see Colin's eyes grow wide.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:45]** Is there a check to see if Colin's heard of astrozoans before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Okay, life science.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** Pull up my character sheet again.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Life science, 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** Yeah, you've heard of astrozoans before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:05]** Okay.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Cool.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** That's cool.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:15]** You see Colin's eyes grow really big at the at the telling of Estra zones replacing senior leadership on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** Spooky, huh?

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** I know why we can't really trust anyone.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** No one, it seems, is who they appear to be at first.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:29]** It kind of makes me wonder about these this group of people that have picked us up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:36]** I do not doubt that the stewards are a fantastic organization.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:43]** But I think you're correct that we need to verify that the people that we are on board with are, in fact, stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Stewards, exactly.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** I've dealt with stewards in the past, and so far it checks out.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:51]** But after everything we've been through, we've got to be really careful.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** And I encourage you, Colin, also to be very skeptical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:59]** I am very much thrust and verified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:00]** Good.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:05]** Well, Rick, you were saying, I feel like you're the best at recounting our journey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** Your perfect android-identic memory has never failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:22]** You just hear him, like, rewinding, and you just hear the screams of children, and then he's like, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** The planets that he's just destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Alright.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:36]** As I mentioned, those goblins and the Bar Kess slash Hobgoblin, we found them tearing apart the ship at one point.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:42]** And they were uncovering portions of the ship that were actually not a part of the Chimera.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:48]** They were from a starship known as the Star Dream 2.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** And from my understanding, that starship had been missing for years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** Would Cullen know the Star Dream 2?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Roll a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Just keep rolling them, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** Keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:10]** I think if you want to assist, that is like you saying, oh, do you know it?

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Because I will tell you.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** But if you want Colin to figure it out for themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** You may have heard of it before in this context.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** One seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:43]** what's up here's assists i guess he could be like you know and then plant cues yeah i think i heard about it before if i remember you may remember it from something that that thing where it was i saw john shake his head but i don't know if that was a like this is a terrible idea or if that was a you don't actually know the ship i i was not trying to shake my head


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:47]** It was that cruise liner that vanished a few years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Right?

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** So, like, does Colin have any knowledge independent of this conversation?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** You better remember that headline.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** I remembered that headline from a few years back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Yes, it's very alarming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** That's the ship you were on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Not necessarily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** Is that the ship we were just on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** We don't know.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** It was...

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:18]** The inner parts of it seem to have some markings that indicated it was from that ship.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:22]** So perhaps it was salvaged, perhaps it was repurposed, we don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** And this is where the mythology of a chimera comes from.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:32]** It's almost as if the chimera had swallowed and taken the star dream.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:38]** But we are not certain of how or why or anything related to that.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** We are not complete.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:42]** There is much, much more to describe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** Go ahead, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Go ahead.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** We were then attacked by pirates.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** And the pirates were associated with the astrozoans that were already on board.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** And from my accounting, I do believe that the Vesk...

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:23]** was on board has been an astrozoan since the beginning but there's no way to confirm that it is possible that the security officer that went missing was also a vesk i mean an astrozoan so you've got shape shifters you've got vesk you've got space pirates what else could go wrong it was interesting that the pirates did seem to know let me tell you our friend here and rick looks over at here's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Starfishers, right?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Yeah.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:32]** Well, Colin, you'll know that I was once a pirate.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** Yeah, I was once a pirate, but I'm no longer in that trait.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** I'll just put it that way.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:48]** One of them happened to know me for some reason and falsely accused me of killing their significant other, which I did not do.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** That's a very Rick move, and I don't just go around murdering people for the hell of it.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:59]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** More judicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:08]** It's almost like there might be 54 episodes of Piracy to listen to at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** Maybe someday we can recount my adventures.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:20]** So you get identified by one of these pirates, and then what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:25]** Well, we fought them in order to get past them to try to escape.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** Because at that time, the ship began to fall apart.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** It was shaking, and there were explosions.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** It was chaotic, to say the least.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:39]** And while we were trying to combat them and the ship itself...

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:45]** The Astrozoans had revealed themselves to be other members of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Hang on, hang on, hang on.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** These pirates, they tried to destroy the ship instead of taking it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** It is very unclear.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** And again, we won't get to this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** They were looking for something, right?

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** They were, but I can't remember exactly what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** Rick is rewinding fast forward.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:06]** I don't remember what they were after.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** The starfishers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Yeah.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** The starfishers wanted to take over the Chimera.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** They just wanted the ship itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** They take entire ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** They also had some interest in just what was aboard, yes, and taking things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Oh, just general interest in pillaging?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** It is true that some pirates specialize in taking entire ships or fleets or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** There is such a thing.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** They were interested in the cargo, but you guys didn't get too far with them.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** But overall, you got the sense that they were playing the long game to take the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Yeah.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** We did find the other cargo bay at that point.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:46]** And there is where we found...

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:50]** Al Giada, who was the security officer for the Chimera.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:58]** Except we were fairly certain that this Al Giada was actually an astrozoan.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** And we fought them.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** And that is when things got very strange.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** We found the professor's

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:09]** Relic is the best term that we can give it.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:17]** It happened to be a shard of an unspecified metal that had Aklo writing on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** A shard of metal, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Do you still have that relic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Strange metal.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Yep, I still got it.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:33]** It glowed a couple times whenever we got next to certain interesting objects.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** But I'm keeping it on me, right?

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:40]** But if we need to review it, we can do it together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:47]** So at this point, the ship was really starting to fail, and we knew we had to escape.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:53]** And as we were heading towards the escape pods, everyone on board seemed to drop dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Yeah, that was the creepiest part of this whole journey, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** As if somebody just switched the lights off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:06]** And we also found at that time that the radios that the ship's personnel had, the radios were fake.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** They did not send any signal out of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:16]** It's weird too, Colin, because we checked the bodies of the people that just dropped dead and

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:20]** As many of them as we could, and there was nothing really installed in them or anything.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** They seemed biological, and it was really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:31]** So these are real bodies, but some kind of... No offense, Rick.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** Some kind of a fake scenario?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Like a simulation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** It seems that way, doesn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** That is my concern.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:46]** I am not certain if these people were actual people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Or just meat puppets.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Whole meat puppets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** But how were they controlled is the big question.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:53]** We don't know.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** We didn't find anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** Right.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:01]** And to return to your topic of simulation, it was when we reached the escape putts.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:07]** We each entered an escape pod and as we ejected from the ship, we realized we were in a simulation.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:14]** The ship itself was suspended in a room and the escape pods were on cables of some sort.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:18]** They all came down and landed in a specific place.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:22]** that happened to be aboard the outpost that we were located.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** The larger outpost, yeah.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:35]** So that is how we arrived onto Outpost Omega, was via this ship that at some point was taken and turned into a simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** What's a crazy turn of events?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:44]** What a fold in this conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** I have a theory.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** There are at least three folds to this conspiracy, and that probably was the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** That sounds right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:02]** John's hiding his face.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:07]** John is trying so desperately to poker face right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:15]** There is, there's one thing that I've missed, I think the most, and that's John's poker face.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** That's pretty good.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** John and I have played poker over the years.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:27]** His face was not this good in high school, not in early college.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** The escape pod's on cables.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** That makes no sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:42]** It does not, unless you compare it to some of the other things that we found once we were further into Outpost Omega.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:49]** We discovered that Outpost Omega was actually a research facility of some sort.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** There were several experiments.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** For the Greys.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** For the Greys, correct.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Who?

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** You know, greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** The grey.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** You know greys, right?

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** The elusive creatures that are found throughout the galaxy.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** Is 14 enough to know anything in particular about greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** 14 is enough to know that...

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:32]** you know nothing them being like oh yeah we saw some grays would be like us sitting and being like yeah i was i was walking in the supermarket there was a gray in the aisle buying ketchup you're you're like shut the like what no i mean why wouldn't grays like ketchup that's what i'm saying they're actually clearly it's horseradish anyways

**[00:26:32 - 00:27:00]** but what is that we'll add ketchup and horseradish to our food based banter items yes that sounds really good to go but the point is that sounds terrible you think that they like that is that seems just as far-fetched as like you're like okay it's like a simulation like that sounds like a lot but and then you're like and then graze like this might be a little over the line you know yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:11]** It's like somebody turned up the crazy on our discussion, and now it's hard to really take us seriously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** You mean greys from the nursery rhymes?

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** You mean the greys from that sci-fi on the holosphere?

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Those greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:27]** Yeah, like those conspiracy things, theories.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Kidnap people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** The ones with the reverie skin and the bulbous heads.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Yeah, those ones.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Yep, those guys.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** We actually met them.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** Yeah, fought them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** We found the first that we encountered were actually already dead.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** We found their corpses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** They weren't mannequins.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** They weren't costumes with others inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** No, they were actually flesh and blood.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Ugly gray blood, but still blood.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:07]** And the interesting thing about the bodies that we found is that they each had a cavity in the back of their necks from where we believe there was a bomb inserted at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:13]** Perhaps to protect their handlers.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:18]** As a physician, would Colin have knowledge of cortex bombs?

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Roll the culture check.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Medicine check.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Yeah, it would have to be a medicine or a physical science check.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** I mean, this is like you were a physician.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** You were not a demolitions medical expert.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** I mean, also, too, you're getting our secondhand take, right?

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Right.

**[00:28:38 - 00:29:01]** medicine doctor okay would okay that was an 18 uh you might maybe have like read an extreme case you know while you were studying but it's clear that doctor okay has has done you know is speaking with some a bit of authority having seen it firsthand but you're still getting it second hand okay so just the direction of the blowout and the uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:09]** The sort of burned areas, the way the cavity seems to have been some sort of a small explosive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:19]** I think what you guys see is initially skepticism, and it slowly, as you recount more of the story, turns to horror.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Sounds about right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Yeah.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** Sounds about right.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:27]** That's the look on my face that I had when I was dealing with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** How do you think I felt?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** That was the first one that saw it.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** It was terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** I do have to correct myself.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Sorry.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** I've been saying Omega.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** It's actually outpost Omicron.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** Again, Kevin has a terrible memory, and I apologize for that.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:46]** We know they were grazed not only because we found the corpses, but we also ran into one alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** It called us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** No, the gray bounder was separate.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** This is the gray that was in the room.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Oh, yeah, we'll get to that, Colin.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** Oh, yeah, there was some wild ****.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:02]** That guy was extremely rude, I gotta say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:15]** The gray that we found alive called us subjects, and he told us that we were to donate our brains to him, I'm assuming to turn into some kind of biological hard drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:20]** I think Colin might be stuck on the gray hybrid and actual gray.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** Yeah, so there's... Hold on, hold on.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** You found gray hybrids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Uh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** That is a separate species.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** But yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** We'll get to that.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Trust me.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** All right.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** And you see Colin take a deep swig.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** I'm not sure where I should continue.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:55]** There were so many experiments that we ran into.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** There was hybridization.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** There was special weapons manufacturing.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** There was teleportation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** And he turns to Hirsch.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:10]** Is this the experiment where he's found the multidimensional glasses you told me about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** No, that's to come.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** That's a different experiment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:29]** It's kind of related to the greys, but it's... Really, the whole place was just full of different horrors to experiment on unwilling subjects.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** That's the impression I get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** The point is, Colin, like, the greys were running the show in this place.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** All this stuff they set up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:41]** If you remember, Krug even was experimented on.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Rest in peace.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Correct.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:46]** And he crosses his giant hat off again, knocks over another cup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** R.I.P.

**[00:31:48 - 00:32:00]** Harag was an Akheshti rivener, and riveners are known to be mindless and incredibly aggressive, and yet Harag had the mentality of a small Akheshti.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:10]** It was almost as if the greys had stunted his mental capacity in order to maintain his mental capacity as his body began to swell and become stronger.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:14]** There were so many experiments on this outpost.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:18]** Another one we found, they were driving a bolita

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** to absolute insanity with a fear beacon.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:28]** We were able to disable the fear beacons and communicate with the Belita only before they too passed.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** John, did the Belita have a...

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** A skull bomb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** I don't think so.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I think the bleeder just died.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** I think it wanted to die.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Yeah.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** The sweet release of death.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** I remember really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** I thought it did have a bomb in the neck, though.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:48]** I thought Rick was holding her, and then her head exploded.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** He was like, what the f***?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Is that right, Joe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** I'm looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Keep talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** I'll let you know.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** Something scary and freaky happened.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:05]** You can, if you look in that will save packet that Rick had, I think it's recounted there somehow.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Some mystical force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:15]** There are 69 one hour episodes that you can review.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:18]** These are like captain's looks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Yeah.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Rick keeps them in his database.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Be careful when you look through his database.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:27]** But if you look there, yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** I'll show you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:33]** I think it is important to note that there was a fourth member of our group prior to finding you.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:40]** He passed during a combat with a teleporting dinosaur.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** The hat comes off.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** I.V.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** Cullen grabs the cup from in front of the hat.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** I'm running out of cups right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Thank you.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Hey, bartender.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Another round.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** There is no bartender.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** It's just you all.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** The stewards are so understaffed.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Oh, my God.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** It was at night.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** It was very Spartan, this setup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** I feel like there have been a couple of stewards that walked by and overheard and just rolled their eyes.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Their names are literally stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** They should be serving us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** I'm a little suspicious now of these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** They don't live up to their name.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** But this is true.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Nico died.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Nico, Nico.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** It's really sad.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Nico Orion.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** You might have heard that name.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Yeah, you may have heard of Orion Industries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** You see Colin visibly flinch.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Like, Orion?

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Yes.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** That's the very sun.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** That's the very same.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** The weapons, folks.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Correct.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** From my understanding, his...

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:50]** Mother had been maintaining the company and happened to oust him and threatened to kill him for some reason.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** And he was fleeing from his own organization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** He started to kind of go insane.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** Like he sort of started merging with technology in a weird way.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:02]** So maybe the death for him was also a sweet release.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I don't really know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** Live by the sword, die by the sword, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** If that sword is technology.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** I believe that is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** It's really rich coming from a murder boat.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** That's probably the deepest Rick gets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Oh man.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** I do believe that accounts for most of the events.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:38]** Again, many experiments and some of the things we saw were disturbing to say the least.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:41]** And we did not explore everything because of course we were trying to escape.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:48]** But you found the Beleda, and then you found me in a bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** After Krug and some other stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:59]** Yeah, we fought like a swarm thing, and then there was a Sheeran plushie.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** I think that was before you.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** It was really cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Swarm Corvox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:07]** I forget who, I think it was Rick actually that like finished him off and he was just coming around.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** That's Rick's.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** I think, yeah, of course it was.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Yeah.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Um, yeah.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:19]** Then we found, we, we took part, took of the experiments that led to such things as those multidimensional travel goggles and so on.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:32]** There was also that image of you here wearing a business suit in a crowd of people that were cheering you, it seemed.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:37]** But there was a gray looking directly at the camera from the crowd.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:43]** Again, very strange things that I have no comprehension of what actually is going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:46]** It really defies all reason.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Just like everything else you've told me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** We have to trust each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:58]** Believe me, if we knew what we were up against, we'd probably be in better shape.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:03]** But given everything that's happened, I don't know what to believe anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:07]** If I knew what we were up against, I probably would not have boarded the Chimera.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:12]** I... But it was when we found you that we continued on.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:18]** At that point, we were in contact with the stewards, and they offered us an escape path.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:29]** We worked with them in order to defeat the troll that was merged with some kind of quantum radioactive...

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:53]** ability that allowed him to teleport that explains it how he was able to move so quickly for such a big creature there were also the little ones that we had to worry about but that's a different story and then i i believe that that sums up everything from what i will call books one and two of our adventures files

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** I filed them separately in my mind.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** It was then that we ended up here on the Voidcrier.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:06]** And as we left Outpost Omicron, we watched the Outpost explode.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:11]** And at first I thought it was because we had planted charges or someone had planted charges.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:18]** But then the explosion, it reversed and imploded.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** And then vanish.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** There was no remains.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** I mean, you were there to see that, right?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** He was there, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** Yeah.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** The explosion and then the unexplosion.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** It was green, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Unexplosion.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** That is an appropriate term for what we witnessed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Yep.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** I'd call it that.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** I've never seen anything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, me neither.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** I've seen something like it before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** What?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** But I've never seen it green like that.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** That was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** I mean...

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:53]** Maybe it seemed like a black hole or something, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:57]** I believe it might be something to do with the gray technology that they were using.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Oh.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** There's not a doubt in my mind it was related to the grays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Yeah.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:07]** Or these really, really possibly suspicious stewards.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Possibly.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Possibly.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:16]** I think Colin is still skeptical of the greys themselves.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:24]** Like, the imagining of little grey men orchestrating this whatever's happening.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:36]** But also, like, from what he knows about the starfishers and the Zorro... Astrozoans.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Astrozoans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:37 - 00:40:00]** yeah zoroastrians austrians astrazones rick would see your confusion on believing us and i think he he'll actually try to like recap his memory to that point and and we'll try to project an image from his his commune to show like to do that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** I don't know.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Can I roll an engineering check for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:09]** I think everyone on your comms is able to bring up something and share it.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** And maybe, you know, there might be a little hollow emitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Ooh, I rolled an eight for engineering.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** So he's like, hold on, I can show you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Your path freezes.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Here's is going to do this.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:27]** He's going to roll his own sort of, like, computers check, maybe?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Or it might have to be an engineering check.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** To help?

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Yeah.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Well, not to help.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:36]** He's going to take an independent action to try to, like, make something that he could do that.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** Is that too much and too little time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Yeah.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** I think if you're just chilling, sitting there.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** All right.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** That's...

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:48]** A 29 makes me feel like you pull out and do it on your pad, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Or you grab Rick's arm and he's like, hold on.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:55]** There you go.

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:05]** I think all you would see is the image as we came into the room because that's just burned into his memory of the gray standing at the podium with the tubes of light coming down from the ceiling.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:10]** This is the best that I can show you, but they are real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** To Colin, it looks like an elementary school diorama of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:44]** he may be like a killer but he's not I think a liar except about the killing stuff but if it's gonna be like a gray or whatever it's real it's a real deal right this is a this is a wild turn of events I don't know what to think I am I feel like I am on the same starship as they would say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** There are unanswered questions that I still have.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:52]** When did the Greys capture us?

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:55]** Our ship was obtained at some point.

**[00:41:55 - 00:42:01]** And I don't know if it was when... If it happened prior to our gathering at Liberty Station.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Or, correction, Legacy Station.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Or if it happened during our transit.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:12]** It is possible it was during the pirate attack.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:21]** And you see his eyes just running through trying to picture everything that happened and trying to find that point.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** And I think there was a point where the ship shook and nobody knew why.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** We never got down to the engineering bay to figure out what was going on down there.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:37]** I would have told you about the combat that happened with the captain and the bar cast in the bridge.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** Yeah, there was just a lot of strange things that happened.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** And another question I have is, how did you get there?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Which I know you do not have the answer for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** I've got the same question.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** What were you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** What is it that you were trying to do again?

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Where are you trying to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** I was on Akaton.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Yeah.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** Responding to some monster attacks.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:09]** The word on the street was that there were some raveners that were out of control.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** Had stormed through a few towns and they needed some help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** That's not unheard of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** Right.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:22]** They just drop you in as like a medic or a healer or whatever in these situations.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:28]** Do you work for a particular... Oh, you do, right?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** That non-profit.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Correct.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Yeah.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:35]** Humanitarian for Absalom.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** What were you doing on Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Being a humanitarian, I thought.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** Your jurisdiction is not restricted to Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Not at all.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** Much like the stewards, we go where we're needed.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:59]** Sometimes it's the station itself, sometimes it's Akiton, sometimes it's the reaches of near space.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Wherever they need us, we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:05]** Well, we need you now, so we're glad you're with us.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Apparently.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Yeah.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** It would have been really, really, really hard, that fight, without you.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** And Rod, R.I.P.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Yep.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Some crazy developments.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:27]** The world that we find ourselves in, not just with the Astrazones, but the Greys and the Stuarts.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** I don't know which way is up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** So do you have any, like, I don't know, long-term goals in the near future?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** To get home?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I just want to know more about you, you know?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:43]** I know that you're getting involved in helping, you know, in combat scenarios and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** Where do you see yourself in five years?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Yeah.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** Is this an employment interview?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** I just want to know more about you.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** I mean, I got to learn a lot about these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** As you can see, and he looks down at his armor.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** You know, I'm a mystic.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:06]** I've always had a gift for the supernatural.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Come from Siren Ray.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** I wish I had picked a deity with fewer R's because that's really hard to say.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Yeah.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:23]** And, you know, I learned from a young age how to manipulate the supernatural.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** Figured I should use that to help my fellow man.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** And so...

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** Here we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Mysticism is a bit.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** That's partly my trade, too.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** It's kind of neat.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Something I've always wanted to explore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:51]** I don't know if Dr. OK is like, I've been curious about that as life goals or like, I want to take a sample of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Maybe both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** How many metachlorians do we have in our blood?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Right.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So Colin casually slides closer to Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** Come to the mystic side of the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** Start doing some magic s*** together.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:24]** And as the night continues, their conversation continues, their voices fade and we zoom out past them into the dark blues and reds and purples of the drift outside.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Thank you, y'all.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** That was awesome.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** Fantastic recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:37]** Y'all, I am positively giddy to get back into three-fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:43]** My heart is like throbbing because I'm remembering everything that we played through and I'm like, f*** me.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** I have no idea where we are.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:50]** Book three is going to just be... It's not like there's going to be a resolution.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:55]** It's not like we start the next episode and it's like, oh, by the way, yeah, the stewards told us... This is the second fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Yeah.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:04]** The crazy part is, at the end of this book, however long it is, we're still only halfway there.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** So much to uncover.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Thank you, everyone.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** We'll see you next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Get excited for next week.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** See you next week.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Next time as we start book three.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** See you, guys.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** See you.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Peace.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Peace.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** Peace.
