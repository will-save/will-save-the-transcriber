**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:58]** Let me actually hit the start button on my timer this time.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:00]** Hey, everyone.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** Wow.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:06]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Anthologies, anthologies, anthologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** I'm Kevin Decker.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** I am your GM.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** I'm a first-time GM.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** I'm sorry to remind you that.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:14]** It's been a few episodes since I told everyone that.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** This is Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Hey, Kev, is this your first time GMing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** Yeah.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:20]** Ever.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** I never would have guessed.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** I would not have known.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** You're doing a good job, Kevin.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** In case we don't tell you enough, I'm really enjoying this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Yep, having a great time.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:31]** Yeah, the combats are super well-balanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** No, I'm not.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** On the aggregate, I think you're doing fantastic.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** I am enjoying it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:42]** I'm playing it exactly as the book is written.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Thank you very much.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** We're playing Junker's Delight.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:53]** Thank you very much to Jason Keeley, Misha Buschager, and everybody else who had any involvement with this.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:58]** The combats are very well balanced, despite what these guys say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** There.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Kevo, I have a question.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** How many extra enemies did you add as the GM in the last battle?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:16]** Um, I will say the original was N and I, I will admit that I introduced greater than N. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Can you give us a range?

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** Plus two, plus three.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** Between, I'd say plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Between zero and 5,000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:35]** It was actually like, uh, it was actually like N plus N times I plus three parentheses type N.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Anyways, moving on.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** What?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Actually, we would have just been in plus parentheses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** I'd have to actually really look at how that equation would work out.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** But yeah.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** So how are you guys doing this week?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I don't really have a question ready for you guys.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I normally have like a go around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** Oh, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I've got one.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Yeah.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Shoot, Benny.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Peanut butter, crunchy or creamy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Oh, creamy all the way.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** I hate crunchy stuff.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** I do crunchy for sure.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** You want an experience, man.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** Yeah.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** It's just like a... Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Short question there.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** You might as well just have a flat piece of chicken.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Yeah.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:25]** I will say I do, and I didn't learn this until recently, but we have just a jar of peanuts, and I'll just take a handful of peanuts and eat them.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** Ew.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** And making my own peanut butter is actually pretty good.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Wait, you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** You make your own peanut butter?

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Yeah, you can make peanut butter.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Well, yeah, if you eat peanuts, you're making peanut butter.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:37 - 00:04:04]** so like creamy peanut butter is just somebody else's chewed up peanut butter i think so no i'm making my it's like homemade i'm not so wait i'm just saying i chew i chew yeah i chew my i chew my peanuts before i smell you just regurgitate like a bird into like no they're already in my mouth so wait okay this got really weird i'm sorry you chew the peanuts and then you put it on the bread and then you eat it it's sort of like twice baked potatoes but yeah with peanuts grayson grayson likes peanuts though he'll actually like point at the cupboard where i get the peanuts from and he's like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** But none.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** But none.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** But none.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** But none.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** That's super cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** Wait, Will, are you crunchy?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** I didn't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Yeah, you're conspicuously quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** I really don't even like peanut butter.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Oh, wow.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** But if I'm going to eat it, I prefer crunchy.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Okay.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Yeah.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Because it's most like regular nuts.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** I just think it's really sad that we're like excluding an entire fraction of our audience because... Who have a peanut allergy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** Yeah.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** If you have a peanut allergy, we...

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** It's fine.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** You can buy peanuts to be honest.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** You're not missing out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** In my opinion, you're not missing out.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** Tell me what you think.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** Cashews are overrated too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Stop it.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** They don't taste like anything.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** We're about to fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** They don't taste like anything.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:55]** Almonds are too dry for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Cashews are dope.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** I will agree with that.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** They're too dry.

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** They're too hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:06]** I like almond slivers on certain veg that is roasted, but, I mean, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:11]** See, with almond slivers, it's the same with, like, a good corn chip.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:17]** Like, I enjoy the experience, but I inevitably find at least one lodged in my gums somewhere the next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Right.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** We have a jar of cashews, too, and I make cashew butter in my mouth sometimes.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Kevin, I don't need to describe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:35]** I don't even want to think about it.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** I'm going to make some jam today.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Just put some berries in your mouth.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** Peanut butter and jelly.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Just like hawk out some bread out of your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** All right.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** That was the last time I recommend a subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:59]** Thanks for playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Amazing.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:08]** I actually, I don't like, I don't like nuts in a lot of my, like when it comes to candy bars or even salads, I don't prefer nuts applied on their own.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** I just don't like the crunchiness that adds to my otherwise satisfying meal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** Yep.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** Well, the pizza house, those are good.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Yeah.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** But Kevin is anachronistic.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** So it makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** I don't even know.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** And I'm Chris.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Not at this time.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** I feel just like will, but you're like a different kind of anachronistic.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:30]** Will could be from any time in the future or past, but you're like from an alternative past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** I feel anachrono meaning time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** Anachronistic.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** Anachronistic is the better pronunciation for sure.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** Well, what year were you born?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** A year between 1990 and 1970.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** Bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Never mind.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** That's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** We're going to go visit and just find your birth certificate somewhere.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** What we need to do is just go with Will to the pharmacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** Knowing Will, he's got like four with different dates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** There's speculation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** He's got some burner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:15]** After my friends yesterday asked me how old Will was, I looked him up on the internet, and then I just found an old portfolio site-ish kind of of yours, Will, but it was forever ago.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** I think it's yours.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** I don't know any other program.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** You should send it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** I don't know.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Was it GeoCities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:25]** Then I wouldn't even have to look up his birthday.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Although, to be fair, I did Geocities websites when I was younger, too.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** I would like to see the link to this.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** I'll show it to you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Oh, this is a real story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** At any rate, I couldn't get your birthday yet.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** It's blocked.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It's blocked up.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** Will could erase his history online.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** I know he could.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Or modify it.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** He could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Very easily.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** The mystery remains.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** It's within my powers, perhaps.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** It is, it is.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** Successful computer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** I think Will was the inspiration.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Was the inspiration for Grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** For Grace?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Yeah.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** The aliens?

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** Just like no evidence found anywhere.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Yeah.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Nobody really knows anything about him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** If anything goes up, it just leaves the infosphere very quickly.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** Dip.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** They're silenced.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** Silenced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:18]** Gonna sue Paizo for copyright infringement or whatever the term is for... They stole your likeness, is that... Yeah, your likeness.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:45]** wait what i'm just kidding because gray's our character and yeah yeah they're a race it was a joke man jesus all right moving on let's go back to peanut butter in your mouth kev go make some things make some butter oh dude okay peter pan butter peter pan makes a crunchy peanut butter but it's honey roasted peanut butter that sounds great oh that sounds like

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** They make a creamy and a crunchy.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** The creamy is readily available everywhere.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** The crunchy I can only find like once every few months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Because it's so desirable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Because I guess.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Or they just don't make as much.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** I don't know.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** I just know in this area I can never find it.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** And when I do, it's like Christmas.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** I should.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:51]** If I had my druthers, though, Vinny, as you say, from the South, then I would definitely... I can't believe people still say that.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:54]** That's kind of awesome, actually.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** Yeah.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** I think I might be the only one that still says that.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Okay.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** You're also from another time, I see.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:04]** My grandmother says if I had my druthers, but she knows that it sounds... It's kind of like the bee's knees.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** It's something from a long time ago.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** I just want to bring back the vapors.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** That's it.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** The vapors?

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** I've got the vapors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** I think I'm experiencing the vapors.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** What is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** What is that?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Where you feel like you're going to faint or something?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Yeah.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Does that mean that?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:31]** I think it's like back at the same time when people thought that there was a mysterious form of matter called ether that, you know, would affect physics.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** So, you know, it's just like there are things in the air.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** I've got the vapors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:45]** Victorian era women were viewed as fundamentally weak, and so they would be susceptible to other forces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** We are more enlightened now today, though.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** Someday, like 100 years from now, people are going to laugh at us for all the weird things we thought.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Yeah.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** All right.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:03]** Well, now we're just directionlessly talking and waiting for Kev to step in.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** That's right.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Floating off into the drift.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** GM us into shape, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Come on.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Yeah.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Come on, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** Balance another combat for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** No, this is what I'm going to do.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:22]** By ADD, I've got three computer screens, and I'm bouncing back and forth trying to prep the episode and figure it out.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Sorry, I got distracted.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Cool.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Okay, well, let's take a minute.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** We're back on the Caduceus.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** That is your guys' pirate ship.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:37]** This is some documentary from years ago.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** And we're in that busy room again.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:45]** There's lights all over the place and a camera set up in the ward room where the officers normally have their meals.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** It is actually Rolu's probably the last one to leave.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Thaddeus is already gone.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** He's stepping out.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Rolu's kind of still hanging out in the back.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:58]** Torme is kind of running the show, being the liaison between the documentarians.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** That's the word, right?

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** And the rest of the ship.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:11]** And during that time, the, a young, uh, Lashunta, which is actually your wine three, your, your little yeoman comes like pushes the wardrobe door open.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:20]** He's carrying, uh, a pot in his hands and he kind of just walks up and says, sorry, excuse me.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:29]** And he sets the pot down on the table next to all the candies and somebody else sets about a new bottle of water.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Um,

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** And he's like, there you go, chief.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** And he steps back out, kind of shaken.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** And the director of this documentary is kind of a little confused.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:46]** And he looks at Tremaine and he goes, I thought we were supposed to get one more person for the interview here.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** That's just a pot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** What?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** You hear laughing from the back of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** You didn't want any stew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** No, we're supposed to have one more person do two truths and a lie.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** We can't just not do it.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** Your captain said he didn't want to do it, but we need one more person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Over here.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Oh, it's Chuck.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:21]** So I imagine there's some sort of houseplants on stage, and he just peeks out from behind one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** So the pot's completely empty.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** It's just a bucket of sand and dirt.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Yeah.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** This is where he was supposed to be.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** This is where he was supposed to be.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** Poor Jobin's like, uh, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** I thought it was like a pot, like a cooking pot.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** No, I was thinking like a flower pot.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Yeah, a flower pot makes more sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** Yeah.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** So Chuck pops out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Got you guys.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Uh, great.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Yeah.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Do you want to take a seat or do you want to get in the pot?

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** That's up to you.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** That's whatever makes you comfortable.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** The pot sounds small.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** He just gets down in the pot and like wiggles in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** There's some candy for you if you want.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** You need water.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** I'm sure plants love water.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Love water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** He just like gulps down the entire bottle at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:06]** I'm sure they told you, but like, so we're playing a game here called, uh, two truths and a lie.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** We're interviewing a lot of the, a lot of your crew.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Um, yeah, we just want you to tell us.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I heard him.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Yeah.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Okay.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:17]** And in any order you want, just tell us one lie and two truths.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** One lie.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:24]** And then our audience watching at home will be able to tell us, you know, they'll be able to guess which one is the lie out of your two truths.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** One lie, two truths.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** One lie and two truths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** One lie, one lie, one lie.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Two lies?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Whenever you're ready.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** As many lies as I want or just one?

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** We prefer two truths and one lie.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Cool.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** I got it.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Got it.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** You ready?

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Ready?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Ready?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Here we go.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Ready?

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Here we go.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Sure.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Ready?

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Three, two... Whenever you're ready.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Go.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** All right.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Here we go.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** Here we go.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** I love fish.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** I was a stand-up comedian.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** What?

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** And I speak five languages.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** And he holed up six tendrils.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** When you say you like fish, do you like to eat fish?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Or what do you mean by that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** That's not what he said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** You just like chilling out with fish?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** You think they're cool?

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Or what do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Oh, my God.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I said I love fish.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Yeah, I have no idea what's going on here.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** I don't.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** I mean, is he a water plant or like a... Is he like a lily kind of thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** I am not an aquatic plant, no.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** I'm a normal grow it in dirt kind of plant.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:32]** I've got some cousins that are aquatic plants, but not me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** This is a question for the other players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** I don't know how to feel about this.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:40]** I don't think that he's done stand-up comedy, but I'd see him.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** I feel like he would want to, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** I don't know.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Question for the other players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** You built your characters.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** How many languages do you get at level one?

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** Depends on your theme.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Right, yeah.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** So if you guys have three, then five is probably out of five.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Possibly six is out of your...

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** your range, so I would call him no because we know he's level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Yeah, that's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Depends on the class and theme, though.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** But what's his class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** I don't even know.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** Who was paying attention while we were playing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** I mean, he's just like a... I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:21]** I'm pretty sure I have.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** All right, so going down the list, I'll start.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Jack is quite delighted.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** I have no idea which one is the lie.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** I love this game.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** My guess is going to be the languages thing, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Will, what are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** I don't think he's going to stand up.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Okay.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:43]** I guess I'll just mix it up and say that the fish thing is a lie.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** I don't know why.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** I think it's the languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** All right, so that was great.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** I really have no idea what you're going for there.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:55]** But whenever you're ready, I just want you to tell us which one was the lie.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** And if you want to explain anything further, go ahead.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Which one?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Which was the lie?

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** The floor is all yours.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** You don't want me to tell you the truth?

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** No?

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:01]** Just the lie?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** However you want to do it.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** You do whatever.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** It's your show.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** So whatever.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Ready?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Three, two, go.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** I hate fish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** I don't eat fish.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Yep.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Not a fan of fish.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Not an aquatic plant.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** I don't like to eat them.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** I don't like to look at them.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** I don't like to touch them.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** I don't like to smell them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Not a fan of fish.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** So you've done stand-up, have you?

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** We've done a bit of stand-up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** You should look up my routine on the Infosphere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Will do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** He does a routine every halfway night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Yeah.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Oh, my God.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** This is incredible.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** And what languages do you speak?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** I speak.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I speak.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** I speak.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** I speak.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** I speak.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** I speak.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** I speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I speak.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** I speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** You held up six fingers.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Oh, okay.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** That's your stand-up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:04]** Physical comedy is a big thing for him, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** It's like the carrot top of comedians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** The Raxalites are big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Slapstick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** He's not only a plant, he resembles a carrot top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Carrot top, yes.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Maybe he grows carrots on him.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** That'd be cool.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** That would be incredible.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Also, this map looks like Florida to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** I'm sorry, I interrupted that.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Which map?

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Oh, man.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Just like your impression of what Florida looks like.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** I don't know.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** It's literally everywhere.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** This is a junkyard.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's not what I meant.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** I'm not sure what Matt was looking at.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I stick with it, though.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Running around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Looks like Jacksonville.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Man.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** The oily ooze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:53]** Our PCs are up in Jacksonville land.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** All right, so you guys are on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:59]** I totally forgot to move you to the other screen before we started this because I'm a terrible GM.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** No, you're a great GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** But I did start my timer on time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Hey, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** I think it is time to play.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** So let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:13]** I actually was super lazy and didn't write my recap like I normally do, but we can talk about it.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:34]** So you guys were in the middle of combat last time, and I forget exactly where we left off, but Rolu was down to just one hit point, and then another Kvok came out of nowhere, and Rolu at some point went to take an attack and rolled a natural one, and that natural one caused just enough damage to knock you out.

**[00:19:34 - 00:20:03]** knocked down uh chalk then took his opportunity he already had the healing potion out and he did this like very dramatic stab into your chest brought you back to life uh and after that is when thaddeus and termay kind of stepped up and did some combat i think that uh termay rolled a natural one as well his his weapon is now causing damage to him one point every time yes but rolu agreed to uh tinker with it with an engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I got to roll that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** He has yet to do that.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** What else happened?

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** So you finally took out the two remaining.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Sorry, there were three total K'foks at that point.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** One of them was blinded and prone.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:18]** That one stood back up and moved forward without taking an attack.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** And it was still blinded for another round.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** And you guys took out the other two K'foks.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** And then that's when I ended combat.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** And I guess I kind of should have given you an opportunity.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** And I'll just say it now.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:33]** Did you guys want to take a chance to kill that last kafak or just leave it in its blinded, wounded state?

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** I don't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** I really think.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** We already passed that, didn't we?

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, I think we just left it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Cool.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** All right.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** That makes it easy for me.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** So you guys decide to move on from it and just get away from these nests.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:50]** And so you guys move up past the two large pyramids that stand over 14 feet tall, according to what I said.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** And you get around that corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** Let it go back to the nest.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Tell the tale next time it wants to.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** mess with us.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Tell your friends.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Tell your friends.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** Tell them what happened to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** Alright, so you guys get up and around this corner.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** There's a little bit of an opening and... Hold on one second.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Let me scroll.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I lost my mouse.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Do-do-do-do.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:23]** Okay, so as you guys come around that corner, there's a little bit of an opening.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** And then before you, you see a massive avalanche of vehicle parts.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:34]** Steering yokes, empty fuel tanks, exhaust pipes, bent axles, shredded tires, and more.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:40]** These have spilled across the path, making it very difficult to progress forward.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** What, uh, what time is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Uh, you guys started very early in the day.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** So this is, this is probably where you peaked past noon.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** I'm going to say it's, you know, about two and two in the afternoon ish.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** Okay.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** Given like human time standards.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Okay.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** You're going to soak up some sun or something, but you guys were in like Alaska in the summer.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** So it's sun stays up.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Um, no.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Yeah.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** So it's, it's probably like, it's not quite evening.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Um, still daylight, still hot.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Um,

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Still very hot.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** If there was nothing else, I was going to roll the engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** No, there is definitely something else.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Okay.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Kelly, you have a concern?

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** You look concerned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:28]** Before that, Thaddeus is going to look over at Termay, and he's going to be like, Termay, any news?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** So, question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Okay.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:34]** I gave the weapon to distract John, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Or, sorry, Brolu.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** I think so.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** You gave him a weapon?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** During this time.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** So would he be doing the engineering check?

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** You rolled your stealth.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** What did you roll again?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** I forget.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** 15.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** 15.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** John, my friend, please roll a perception check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** 19.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:00]** So Rolu, you tried to distract him enough.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:06]** He definitely sees you doing the action that you're doing.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:10]** He sees you playing with your wrist device that tells you all your information.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** But he can't see close enough to read what's on there.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Fair.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Yep.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:26]** But I'll say that he also notices the way that Thaddeus asked you that question right after your wristwatch beeped and buzzed very loudly.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:31]** And at the same time, Chuck also noticed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** Chuck didn't notice.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** I rolled a 10.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** You didn't notice?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Yeah, I rolled a 10.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Dang it, Chuck.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** You're killing me.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** I'm bugging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:49]** Thaddeus, you said... Any news on any of comms from the captain?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Any updates on our mission?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:24:00]** No, just checking up with some Mayobin subordinates, but perhaps some interesting developments.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** I'll keep you abreast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Excellent.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Mind if I just take a quick glance?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** I'd like to keep abreast of what's going on while we're down here.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** You know what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:17]** Well, it's having trouble loading, but here's my communique from Yeoman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** Does anybody have computers as a trained skill?

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** I don't.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** I do.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** Yeah, you heard them say, like, oh, I can't download that or it's not trouble loading.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Oh, hey, having trouble?

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I can help.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** What are we downloading?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** That's entirely up to you, Tremay, about how you want to respond to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:46]** Something of a perhaps personal insensitive nature, but... Personal insensitive, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** All right, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** It's personal insensitive, but it only concerns the yeoman and myself.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:59]** Just some stuff that the captain and he and I, you know, planned out ahead of time with respect to our mission.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:03]** Nothing to worry yourself about, Shark, but I appreciate your help later, perhaps.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Sweet.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** You don't want me to fix it?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:07]** Is that... No, you're all right for now.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Maybe in a little bit.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:11]** I just want to do a quick summary read.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** One second, please.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** And he just, like, takes a moment and read it.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:23]** And he sees that there are some communications between our ship and the Knave's Revenge.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:29]** And he knows that that is the ship that Hears was the captain of.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** And knows that, of course, Rolu came from there.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:42]** So even though the messages aren't fully downloaded, his suspicions are like, well, OK, obviously some of that makes sense, you know, because he was onboarding from there.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:43]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:48]** But so so to me is like showing his wrist to you during this, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Like, yeah, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Do I see that one of them looks suspicious?

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:13]** because there was some mention of that so all that's on his wrist available it says basically like i've i pulled everything from going on and off the ship from rolu nothing out of the ordinary except for this one message or whatever except for one suspicious message there's some indication that there's someone suspicious message though go ahead to may what did you say who was that from


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:19]** I don't say this out loud, but I'm just clarifying it was She-Ra, right?

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** That's what you said last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:24]** Yes, so that is what the radio men told you.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:33]** Radio men's a position that deals with the communication stuff, and that person, Harden, said that there is a suspicious message from a She-Ra.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** All the messages have been sent, but there were two different packages.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:41]** There's basically like a single file with all of the messages ever sent.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:48]** And then there was a separate file of just a single message from Shira that was flagged by radio for whatever reason.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** But neither of those messages came through.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** The word Shira, though, does that trigger anything in your mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:07]** I mean, Thaddeus would expect that he would talk to Shira, but I'm assuming there's some visual indication that maybe one of them is flagged.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** Even though these aren't downloaded, I'm guessing that loaded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** No, that's what the message content said was like, we flagged this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:18]** It's basically like an email saying like, hey, this one was suspicious and here's the rest of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Thaddeus sees that.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:23]** So Thaddeus sees that, and then he's like, okay.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** And then he kind of holds it up to try to get better reception.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** It's not working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:33]** You hold up one of the four arms that Tomei has, waving it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:38]** Perhaps we just need to get out of this canyon before we can communicate back with the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Excellent idea, Tomei.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** Just let me know when you get a connection again, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Yes, Chuck, what is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:59]** While all of this is going on, after you so politely decline his assistance, Chuck skitters off to play what appears to be him playing in one of the junk piles.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** What you notice is in one of his tendrils is his text communicator.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:10]** And again, you see him messaging the captain with his two hearts and pirate hook emojis.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** It says, making our way through the car yards, fought multiple K'faks.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** Something is up between Thaddeus and Tremayden.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** There appears to be a rift between them and Rolu.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Tensions are high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** You hit the send button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** Thaddeus is, I mean, shock's very perceptive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** And you get three dots.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Dink, dink, dink.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** And it says, message failed to send.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Well, well, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** All right, so now you gentlemen are stuck in this cavern.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** What do you want to do next?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** How is your health?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** What are your spell levels?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Tell us everything going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** I'm not going to tell you my health.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I like how you ask all the time.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Go ahead, Tom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:03]** I think while all this is happening, Rolo's just trying to work on the pistol, the tactical semi-auto, but also kind of just keeping an ear out.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** He's like, notice, maybe kind of just little glances.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Going to roll an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:23]** And as you're doing that, from around the corner behind you is a 19-foot-tall creature that is actually a combination, just a bunch of K'fox formed together into a giant... K'foxzilla?


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** In one giant trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:34]** Can we get a ticket to the... What did you roll?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** And what is the DC?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Did we talk about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** We didn't talk about that.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:42]** It was DC 15, but I feel like you could take 20 on it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:30:11]** ah yeah could i could i take 20 so it's dc 16 i was looking at the rules of the critical fumble but you're super close it's 15 plus one and a half times the items level which is level one right so 16 yeah if i can take 20 on engineering then i would just do that and on roll 20 i did like as you i figured that you guys weren't gonna like walk away but it would make sense that roll is still hurt so he would have gone and sat down on this little block here about 10 feet to the left so it doesn't look too hot either

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** So take 20.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** There's take 10 and take 20.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** So I think it's up to you if we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:26]** If you can take 20 on engineering, it's up to you whether we are able to at this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:31]** Well, I think it actually, the biggest thing is whether or not there will be any kind of failure incurred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:41]** I could also just cast Mending, but I don't know if that's the same as fixing it with the mechanic of the critical fail that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:56]** incurred okay so take 10 you basically get a 10 on your d20 roll automatically so if you have enough skills to do that like if you had a plus seven then you could take 10 on it and that lets you automatically pass


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** I do have a plus six to my engineering, and it's DC 16, so I could take 10.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Take 10.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** It does say the DC is determined by the GM.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:12]** If you fail the check by 10 or more, you damage the object further, so I technically could fail it.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** It's up to you, though.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** I think whether you want me to do that or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** No, I'll let you do it.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** Sorry, there's just a lot of reading here and I'm a slow reader.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** You can't take 20 on an engineering check to repair an item or object.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** So yeah, take 20.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** So basically take 10 gives you an automatic 10 on it.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** So if you have enough bonuses, you can do that.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** Take 20 as an automatic 20 on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Right, but he can't on a repair object.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Is that what we're doing, though?

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Repairing an object?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** I thought we were just removing the condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** I'll let it happen.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:46]** I'll say that damaging it further is not an effect.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** An option.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** An adverse effect on failure.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** That's a hard argument.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** I'll let it happen, though.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** I'm the GM.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** I can do that.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:58]** I rule that you're allowed to take 20 and make your gun not do one point of damage.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** You're going to take 20, take 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** You can't take 20.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Take 10.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** It says in the book, you can't take 20 for an engineering check to repair an item.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:14]** It does say to repair any weapon or armor, it takes an hour to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** Oh.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Then I'll just...

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** I'll cast Mending on it, if that's allowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:24]** Hey, so Tormadin, this looks like a pretty straightforward fix.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Just going to take a little while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:33]** Let me see if I can repair it on my own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** I cast Mending, which has a 10-minute cast time.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Cool.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** It's a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** While he does that, I think Jack is going to burn a resolve point to get his stamina back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Yeah, I think Rolo is too.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:48]** Thaddeus is just reloading.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Dang.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Okay.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:58]** So I described, there's kind of this cavernous, uh, if you guys ever been out like hiking in a cavern, this part kind of gets real thin.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:03]** It's probably just the width of your body, um, to get through.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** The thing is, does anybody want to roll like survival or perception?

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** I'm getting given that to you.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Go ahead.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:11]** I'm going to say this was a really high DC cause I had to prompt you to do so.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** What are we doing?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Perception or survival?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Your choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Well, I got a 19 for either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** There we go.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Okay.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** So Torme goes ahead and points out that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Jack got a 19 as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** That there was a landslide here.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:32]** So like it was probably clear, but like the sides of the walls had fallen fairly recently.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** Like in the last two days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:40]** Does it look like it was a naturally occurring slide or like somebody set some charges to slide it in?

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Could I do an engineering check to see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** No, you guys are just, you just know, like, you don't see any explosions or anything like that.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:52]** So, like, by naturally occurring, whether it happened because of the wind or something else, that you wouldn't be able to tell.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:57]** But you just know that it happened recently and everything else around here seems fairly stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:00]** So it's stable or it's not stable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** It's stable now.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** It was fairly stable before.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** There was a landslide of some sort.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** It is now a very tight squeeze for you.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:15]** So if you want to pass through, I'm going to have to get an athletics check from each of you.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** Chalk, I'm going to give you a plus two on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:24]** I was about to say, it's tight for a medium creature, but for a tiny creature, it could probably just dance through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Would it be an acrobatics check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Or just athletics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** Pretty sure it said athletics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:37]** Yeah, there's like circumstance, light debris or disruption, heavy debris or disruption.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:40]** So, I mean, yeah, I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Yeah, and I'll tell you like the biggest thing with this is not so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** Raising against two opposite walls, circumstance, DC modifiers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Sounds good.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:56]** Yeah, I'll say it's not so much about trying not to get another avalanche, but it's more because there's a lot of sharp, jagged glass and steel pieces sticking out in that area.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:01]** So, like I said, Chuck, you get to go through with a plus two to your roll.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Everybody else, roll me an athletics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Cool.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** I'll go first with a 16.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Okay, the two of you make it through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** No problem.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** 13.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Seems high enough, Kevin.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Also 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:17]** As the two of you come through, you each take 1d6 of slashing damage.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Oof.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** And I'll let you roll your own damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Okay.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Two.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Six.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Watch on.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Literally undid my short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Six?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** That's insane.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Holy crap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** You hit every sharp piece of metal between each end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:42]** You, like, walk into one, and then the reaction, like, you fall into another one.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** That is just, like, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** Daddy just, like, looks at Roloo, and he's like, really, Roloo?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** Really?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** I'll put Rolo at the back here.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** Okay, so you guys make it out to the other side of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** Now I need to make 10 minutes rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Oh my god.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Is that what you guys want to do?

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** You want to take another rest?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** No.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** I know it sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** No, we should press on.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** But I want stamina.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** Really?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** I mean, we're not like... Sometimes, Thaddeus... Press for time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** Sometimes, Thaddeus, it's truly about... Dying android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** All right, so you're not taking a rest?

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Cool, moving on.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** I guess we're taking a rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Are you guys ready to move forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:30]** Sometimes, Sadius, it's about how much you can endure and continue to move forward, not just about... Yeah, I'm going to take a short rest, I think, after that.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Cool.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Yeah, I think I'm going to take another one.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:36]** I'm going to have one resolve point, but I just can't go without

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:39]** You know, it's just about how much you can do right rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** But I'll see you after your full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** I didn't prompt you guys to do anything that's entirely up to your own decisions.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:49]** You guys take a short rest, and in that time, three K'foks come from behind and squeeze through that wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Jack pulls out his datapad and starts playing solitaire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Yes, John.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Cool, I took my short rest.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Jack's playing solitaire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** You guys take your rest.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** Man, horrible.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** And while you guys are resting...

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:08]** We're going to cut.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** And we're going to open back up.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** And we see a large, open sand field.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** Surrounded by wrecked cars and starships.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** Piled up like the Sierra Mountains in the distance.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** The camera is very low to the ground.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:29]** And you hear heavy panting and frantic pounding of footprints getting louder and louder.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Do-do-do-do-do-do.

**[00:37:31 - 00:38:00]** a boot lands on the ground right in front of the camera and it keeps running shots ring out in the background and a camera follows as an android with long green braids trailing behind them sprints for a large abandoned hover truck with the trailer where the trailer is dented but intact any words or logo painted on the side of it has long faded the vehicle lifts to one side as it rests unevenly on its dormant hover jets

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** The android reaches it and clambers into the cab, slamming the door shut behind them.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** Our camera catches up to the truck and it rises up and looks into the window of the cab.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:17]** We see VARI-13 curled up in a ball on the floorboards, frozen with fear.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:24]** Their eyes clench shut, and when they open their eyes, they feel their heart still pounding.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:28]** But now there's an alarm going off and red lights are flashing.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** People in lab coats are scrambling down the hallway.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** Vary feels an explosion from one end of the hall.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** They get up and they run, turning towards the bridge.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:45]** As the last pilot scurries past them out of the room, Vary syncs up their comm unit with the emergency computer near the command deck.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Transponder active.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Transponder codes downloaded.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:56]** Vary turns, pulls a box out from underneath the captain's seat, and then exits the bridge.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:02]** The sign in the hall reads, Engine Room, Lab, Crew Quarters, with an arrow pointing to the right.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:09]** And Navigation, State Rooms, Galley, Escape Pots, with an arrow to the left.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** Vary glances down the hallway to the right.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** The red emergency lights are slowly engulfed in fog of darkness.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** One by one down the hall.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** Vary runs in the opposite direction towards the escape pods.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** And the camera kind of freezes in place as they run down the hallway.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** And then the screen fades to black.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** And you guys are ready to move on.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** All right.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Cool.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** All right.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Yeah.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** So go ahead.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Your screen on the map here.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:46]** I got to figure out how to undo this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Can we wait?

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Can we just talk with her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:55]** So was that Vari 13 running and then having memories of another?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** I'm sorry, what?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** I'm not talking to you, Kev.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** I'm talking to everybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:08]** So that was, I mean, I think that was Vari 13 running from whomever's pursuing them.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Yeah.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** Like that near-death experience is what triggered Vari 8's memories.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** Yeah, I think you're right.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Of the Stormcrier?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Was that the ship?

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** You want to roll a culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** The stellar flare.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Good memory.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** I'm really impressed by that.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:32]** Stormcrier was the name of the, isn't that the name of the ship that we ended up on at the end of book two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** The Void Crier.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** The Void Crier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Yeah, getting a little mixed up.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** There's a lot of ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** The Stellar Flare allowed them to study the drift to get limitless energy.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Yeah.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Looking at your notes, good.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** So, the Stellar Flare.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:53]** So, you guys think that that was Vari 13 having a flashback to Vari 8's memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** And the whole... The lights going off one at a time.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** That was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** That's some unseen shit.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Sorry, I've been drinking quite a bit, so I don't remember what I said.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Moving on.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** You guys.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** Kev's like, wait, I gave you guys a flashback?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** What?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I don't remember.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Cool.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** So go ahead and set yourselves up however you want to write it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** How do you want to answer the battle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:50]** yeah there's a battle maybe maybe not uh we'll have to see when we get there there's like kind of a tight tight narrow um neck going into uh this area let me just say like as you as you come around that corner you find a sea of sand spanning from one side of a canyon to the other not too far off in the distance you see a body of water shimmering in the hot sun hmm

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:55]** And then just past that, you can actually see this broken hover truck.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** Hover truck, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** There's like a U-turn.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:11]** So we came out of that little squeeze canyon where we took an unnecessary amount of damage, Torme and I. And then you go a bit further and then there's a U-turn and it opens up into this sea of sand with a body of water.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:36]** the body of water is like 40 feet away it's probably like i don't know it's like a oval maybe like 25 feet in diameter and then yeah about 100 feet away 60 to 100 feet away is that hover truck and looks to be at the edge of a crevasse or something maybe like a step up and we can't really see past that don't know how high that is i can't tell if it's a step up or a step down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** I'm not sure either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:41]** Is there a body in this water?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** I don't see any.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Are there any signs of a fight?

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** Like blaster fire, scorched sand, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** What would you do to see if there was possibly a fight or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:03]** I would look at the sand or whatever is around for scorch marks from blasters or bullet holes.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** I don't know, maybe dead people too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:34]** so by look around you would kevin do you want us to tell you the roles that we want you to make yeah i want to tell you i want you to tell me the roles you're making okay yeah because there's also the school of thought that we just tell you like narrative what we want and then you say roll this oh okay roll perception you guys should all that's fine except for may who's like hanging out in the back for some reason 15 17 10 18 do we see anything


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** Okay, so the day is heating up.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** It is past noon.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** It is hot afternoon.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** And you realize that this body of water is actually just a mirage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:48]** Oh, Jack is super disappointed.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Jack was like so into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** And actually Torme as he steps forward is the one who kind of covers his eyes and squints just a little sharper.

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:01]** And he actually sees the mirage fade away.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** And you see two bodies laying in the sand.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** All right.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** So from where you guys are standing and the perception rules you did, the mirage fades away for a couple of you and the other ones can put it out and the rest of you see this.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** It's just that heat wave effect, right?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** But you see there are two bodies laying in the sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Torme, be careful if you're going to investigate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** I just want to loot their bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Hold off.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** What they have on them might be important.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Tread carefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:41]** So, I was just going to say, see if it's safe to inspect.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** Torme just wants the loot.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** Is it safe to advance, Kevin?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Is there anyone that we sense around here?

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** Torme has already advanced, so I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Yeah.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** So to me, to me, just walks right up to the body.

**[00:44:53 - 00:45:00]** Uh, first body Rolu, you're over there kind of, you've walked in and down to the left.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** What, what is it that you're standing next to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** It looks like a part of a pod racer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Okay.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** To me personally, it looks like a water heater, but it's a metallic tube.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:15]** Go ahead and roll me a culture check, I think, or an engineering.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** I'll give you engineering on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** I'm fine to do culture, actually.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:24]** That's what I would prefer to do.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:27]** I think culture will ride the call.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Ooh, it's a 25.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** So I'll just say, you know, you recognize this.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:40]** You've probably escaped from enough ships to know that this is an escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** Oh, it's not a water heater from a ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** No, it's not a water heater.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** It's an escape pod, and it looks damaged badly.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** But it's definitely been cracked open at some point, and there's nobody inside.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** So, yeah, it is just a damaged escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** Is this green body our friend?

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:02]** And does said friend have any cool loot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** Thaddeus, we could use your help up here if you want to venture up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** Cool loot?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** I didn't think about loot.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Sorry.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Hold on a second.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** Weapons.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** The green body?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:18]** No, there's no good weapons on it.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** I didn't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:20]** There's a weapon next to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Stop it.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** It is an image on a map and I'm a new GM.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** This is ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** So roll me a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** A medicine check?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** Are you trained in medicine?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Yes.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** I don't have medicine.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** I'm not trained in medicine.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Perception?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Roll me perception.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** I'm only trained in sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Roll me a sleight of hand.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Great.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:43]** You felt a wound in this creature with your sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:49]** I got a 17 sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** I was kidding on the sleight of hand.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Give me your perception.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** I'll call that perception.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** So 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** What did you get perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** 15 perception.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Okay.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** You can see just the way that these bodies are laying.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** They're in the middle of the sea of sand.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** And you recognize that one was a true warrior.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** One is a hilky true warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** The one to the right.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** This guy?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** The one that you're standing over.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:22]** The one to the left is a large male human that has a paler, a lighter skin complexion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** So not native to Akitan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:28]** Probably not native to Akitan, no.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Does anybody else remember anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:35]** Yeah, I mean, the Bari 13 went with a large human male from Absalom Station.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** Lorgan, not Morgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Lorgan.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Lorgan.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** So this is Lorgan.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** It's probably your best guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:53]** Thaddeus says to Shaq, Shaq, can you determine what ship this escape pod is from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Maybe.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Shaq, would you mind checking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:25]** skitters over i don't know if that's a culture or a computers or computers i was thinking computers personally since you're can i roll another culture but i don't know what do you think kevin unless we already determined this but i don't think we did mr gm sir i i will say that no you guys would have no uh well give me so i will give you this if you can roll me a natural 20 right now i will tell you exactly what where this is on like everyone rolls or just just vinny


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** I'll roll as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** I got a 19 for a total of 25.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** I'll give you this.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** This is being really generous.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Yes.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Chalk is like,

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** I got it, guys.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** I figured it out.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:51]** And he pretends like he just knew this, but he actually found, he like wiped away a piece of dust and saw that it says Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** It's Yahtzee.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Shaq?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** You guys are getting real lucky with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** He looks at it and sees that.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** The Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** That's the ship that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** What are you pinging at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** They were exploring the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** I was drawing on the map, Lorgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** That's a pretty good question mark.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** So yeah, you guys would kind of make a good guess that this was Lorgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Okay.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Lorgan.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** It appears that this escape pod is from the Stellar Flare.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** But we have no idea where the Stellar Flare is.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Oh, that they were here.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** What else do we know about the Stellar Flare other than from...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:38]** You guys wouldn't actually know too much about the stellar flare as players or as characters.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** The characters don't know.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** But as players, you would know.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:49]** And as listeners, you might know if you paid attention that the intro, the stellar flare was a ship from hundreds of years ago.

**[00:49:50 - 00:50:00]** that was trying to test some kind of device or technology that would be able to pull directly from the drift to create energy.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:09]** And during that experiment, it underwent some kind of damaging accident and fell to Akidon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:14]** Can I do either a detect magic or a mysticism?

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:17]** Because I guess finding an escape pod here seems...

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:25]** Not out of the realm of possibility, maybe, is the sense that I think Rollo's getting, but it's like, we just weren't expecting that, maybe.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** I could be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:31]** I mean, trying to be cryptic about it.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** You can be cryptic.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:40]** I'll say this, that you know that Vahri13 is looking for something, and that's all I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** And this might be part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:47]** So should I detect magic or roll a mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:51]** Actually, I'm going to have Will and I believe Chalk.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** No, Chalk, you moved away.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** Will, give me one more perception roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Oh, 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** A 19.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:09]** And what I'll say is that you recognize that these two opposing persons, these two bodies that were on the ground,

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** One was a true warrior.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:18]** One is possibly Lorgan, the guide that was supposed to guide Vary 13 into the car yards.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** And you notice that they're not shot.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** Their wounds do not look like shootings.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** They look as if they've been eaten.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:34]** And another part of that is that they were both facing the same direction and not each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Which direction were they facing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** Go ahead and roll me a fortitude save.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** A fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Oh, f***.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Sandworm.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** Natural 20, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Got him.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Nice.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** Fortitude love.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** 19.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** 20.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** That's one.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** We're not a big fortitude crew.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:07]** So you're standing there, and you do have a device on your wrist that is connected to everything else that does have a latent ability to read radiation.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** What?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** And you feel it vibrate just a little.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** As you look down, you see radiation warning.
