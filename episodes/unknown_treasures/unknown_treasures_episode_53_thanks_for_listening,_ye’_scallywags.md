**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthologies.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin Decker, your GM.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:07]** I'm so, so excited for this episode.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** You have no idea.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:10]** The last two episodes were phenomenal.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:12]** Thank you again for Jason Keeley for joining us.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:13]** Woo!

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:15]** But I think this one's a big one.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** I think there's a lot that's going to happen.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** I'm curious where it's going to go.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Like...

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:27]** I don't know how you guys feel, but GMing, I feel like I'm putting together this puzzle, and I'm getting towards the end.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:30]** There are that corner where I got a few spots left.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:34]** I'm just hoping that I have all the pieces that fit there, if that makes sense.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:35]** Yeah.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** I like that analogy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** No, that makes perfect sense.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:40]** Are you getting a bit of GM senioritis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Oh, yeah, I'm done.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** I stopped writing weeks ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:43]** Yeah.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** No, I want to bring this out with a bang.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** This is going to be the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** I think you're just mostly ready to not jam anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** Yeah, you're right.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** I'm going to throw this down.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:58]** Fires and explosions, and then I'm walking away from GMing forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** You're never going to GM ever again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** I think he's kind of serious.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** He doesn't really like it that much, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:13]** Maybe not on a podcast, but you wouldn't even GM if your son wanted to play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** No, I'd force him to GM.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** What if Grayson and Graydaughter were like, Hey, Dad, can we play a game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Right, and I would say, read the rules.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** I'd walk it through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Most Kev answer ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:34]** Actually, I do have the ABCs of D&D up on my shelf.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Oh my god.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** I'm going to give that to him soon because he's starting to read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Nice.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** That's about where Liliana's at.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** I need to get that from Amazon.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** That seems neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** I like this.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:50]** I want to thank you all for making me a better player at Tabletop.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:58]** I joined a D&D game the other night with some people and then some friends from the

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:19]** world that organization that i'm involved in it like there's like people there that like to play dnd so i was like with them and they were like uh it was fun and i knew more than anyone about how to play the game and i did not expect that to happen yes i was like how am i really good at this and you guys aren't this doesn't make sense you shouldn't like i have a podcast

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:42]** yeah and then the guy asked me he was like do you get any hits like one of the guys he's like do you get any hits it's like yeah we get hits like it was like i told them a little bit about will safe so you know did you have fun playing i i did they were we barely got through one round of combat it kind of reminded me of us but it was like actually like i think we actually moved faster than less rules usually

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Yeah.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** The guy was like, we're... You guys played in 5E?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Yeah, it was 5E.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** The guy was like, we're rules as written here.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** But at the end of the night, like, it was obviously not the case.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** Like, no way, dude.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Well, as long as you have fun.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** That sounds great.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** It was very fun.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** It was very fun.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** What was the adventure that you had?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** I enjoy Will Save More.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** I don't know what it was called.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** You're in, like, a town and... Phandalin?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** No.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** It's... We did talk about the wolves, though.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** And Phandalin.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Like...

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:19]** Because I was talking about how we tried to roll animal handling on them in our D&D game with this group of people and then we execution style killed them all.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** It was just too much at one point.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** They had a similar experience.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I feel like, yeah, ball bearings...

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** I don't know the name of the adventure.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I had one game.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I think it was Pathfinder that we were playing.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** But there was one game that we were trying to be too clever.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** We fought this lion thing or tiger or whatever it was.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** This large cat.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** It's a liger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Oh, that big ass f***ing creepy cat.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:48]** We had a ring of resurrection or something, and we were like, let's use it on the cat.

**[00:04:49 - 00:05:00]** So we had this pet zombie cat, and we were like, well, we know this town coming up ahead has the big bad in it, so let's just send a cat in to make sure that we're not going to be ambushed.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** And then the cat...

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:30]** kills the whole town and we're like but we we told we told the cat not to attack unless it got attacked and they're like well the and the towns people the zombie cat came in so we killed it we had to like work our way out of that one but yes so be careful of using zombie cats just say that's a lesson i learned do you zombie cats specifically taming anything and like tabletop just be careful for unexpected things i think i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** I mean, taming in tabletop and taming in real life.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** Be cautious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** Dude, have you seen those people that are like, there's like a cat that has enormous ears.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** It kind of looks like a meerkat, but it's like an American cat.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** No, it's something else.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** It's called a sylvie or a syl.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Car call or something?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I don't know what they're called.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** They're extremely cute, but people like tame them and they're not meant to be.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** No, I don't know what they're called.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** Are you talking about foxes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:02]** Foxes are also really difficult to have in your house as a domesticated animal.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** It's something else that I can't remember the name of.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** No, it's not that.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** It starts with an S. It's not a caracal?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** I really don't like caracals.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** They look f***ing creepy, dude.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** They look kind of like Thaddeus.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Shut up!

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** He's not that kind of cat.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:45]** shut up oh they're called servals i think servals dude they're extremely cute like but they're very very like uh hard to own apparently they're dope though look at them so cute i don't know how to smell it they look like a rabbit um oh they're oh look at them let me i'll share it real quick yeah they have uh they're very cute they look fake they're like a mini cheetah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:51]** They look like a kitten whose body kept growing, but their face stopped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** The ears kept growing for some reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** For an audio podcast going on about the images we see on the internet, it's great.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** They look so ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** I really like them.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:06]** If only we had a video feed that we could share.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Whoa.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** What a crazy concept.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** What do you mean, Vinny?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Keep going.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** I don't know.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Maybe we'll find out more about that soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** What is this video that you speak of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Who knows?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** Maybe there's going to be some chat about that in our Discord.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** Maybe if somebody wanted to learn more, they should join us there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** Yeah, for real.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Y'all need to be joining the Discord.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Like, it's good.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:43]** Also, we've shouted out the rules paralegals a lot, but I want to thank one of our newest, most contributing rules paralegal as of late, who's Adam from STF, otherwise known as Strange Table Fellows, formerly known as Southern Tomfoolery.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Oh, right, right.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:50]** But you've been giving us a lot of extremely useful feedback, and we do appreciate your show.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** Yeah, when you're done listening to this show, hop on over to theirs.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** APA and Living on the Fly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** It's so good.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Classics.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Amazing work.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Shaking his head at us the whole time.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** But he likes it too, so it's a good combo.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** He loves us, but he recognizes that, well...

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** I don't know.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Where are we going?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** We just take too long sometimes.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** And our rules knowledge is bad.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** But at least hopefully you find us entertaining, which I'm sure you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** I'll take the blunt of that.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:32]** Again, I thought this was going to only take 13 episodes, and here we are on 53.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** But I think we should get into the game.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:43]** All right, you got to just go, you know, breathe with me on this one.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** It's going to be a long one because... Here we go!

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** There it is.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:53]** All right, so last time, Dotrulu entered the arena, and the true warriors finally gained the advantage.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** Tremei managed to hurt Tez Tronin enough to make her pull a Thaddeus.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** She ran away tactically.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** But Rolu, Rolu went down.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** And when that happened, Dotrulu offered a simple solution.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** One-on-one.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Winner takes all.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** And it was Terme who stepped up to that challenge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Oh, that was badass, by the way.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:14]** Yeah, it was.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Yeah, Terme, that was incredible.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** Man, still very lightheaded from this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:26]** So after about 10 minutes, Dotrulu and Terme met in the middle of the abandoned Stellar Flare.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** It was actually a half of a Stellar Flare.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** It's just a lab.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** And you guys, the duel commenced.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:39]** But it wasn't long until everyone else joined in, because what would you expect from a bunch of pirates and gangsters?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** The four of you made quick work of the ads.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** There was a Yosuke on each side, took them out fast.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:50]** And then Termei drew back into the lab to the north to try to trap Dotrulu.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** But he was right on his tail.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** With Termei cornered, the rest of you closed in on Dotrulu from behind.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:02]** It was Rolu, though, who learned that Tez had dragged in the bound and gagged Vari-13 into combat.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:09]** But he let Tez slip away with Fari 13, and Rolu joined in on the assault on Do-Trulu.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** Tremei encircled Do-Trulu with a wall of steam.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:18]** Every one of you fired into the steam, hoping to take Do-Trulu out.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:25]** But he burst from that steam into the lab and slashed down Tremei before collapsing himself.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:30]** And as that steam faded away, it revealed the two bodies to the rest of the crew.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Just again and again and again and again.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:37]** Thank you so much to Jason Keeley for joining us.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** He played an awesome Dojo Lulu.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:43]** He breathed so much life into that character.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** It was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** He really did.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** I expect it's a totally different Dojo Lulu, but he ended up doing way, way beyond my expectations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** He was so colorful and amazing.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** He was a true mob boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** He was a true mob boss.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Which makes sense.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** It was perfect.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** It was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** But on top of that, he's just an awesome guest.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** He's an awesome person.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** He was great to have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** You're a good one, Jason.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** You're a real one.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** I really loved having Dotrulu on the show.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Also, Jason, great guy.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** But Dotrulu, great time on the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** Yeah, he was the real good guest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:19]** I think it's just also, we've got to point out, too, that he also wrote Junker's Delight, which is the game we're playing now.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:25]** And he wrote the first book of Threefold Conspiracy, which we loved so much.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** And I hear among our fans, like, it's one of the best books out there for Starfinder.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** So thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:33]** And if you haven't listened, go listen to that.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Yeah.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Yeah, you really should.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** That's our flagship show, so.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** Cool.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** All right, so here's the situation.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Let me take you guys back over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** This is important.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Give us the sitch, Kev.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Yeah, spill some tea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Okay, can you guys see?

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** So on the map here, we have the insides of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** Everybody is up into that...

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:06]** airlock that leads from the rest of the corridors into the main lab where the drift drive and the gray was.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** The gray is actually dead in the middle of that broken drift drive.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:17]** We have Dotrulu, his body taking up four squares, just laying there on the ground, and Torme just next to him.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** And then in the corridors... Torme is down.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Torme is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Torme is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:32]** We have Thaddeus just outside that door, and then a little further down, about 10 feet more, we have Rolu with Chak on his shoulder.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** So, Dotrulu is dead.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** The mission is accomplished.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** And you have what Vahri 13 is looking for, Vahri 8's notes.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:48]** But Vahri 8 is currently being held hostage outside the Stellar Flare by Tez Tronin.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** And I have a question for you guys.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Is Tez now the leader of the True Warriors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** I would imagine so.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** I would imagine.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Can I roll a counter check?

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** I can't imagine because I'm unconscious.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** All you can do is imagine.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** I'm dreaming of spicy Kefauk dogs.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** What did you want to roll?

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Well, I'm like, you asked the question.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:17]** I would want to roll a culture check on the knowledge of internal politics within the true world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** It's just like a random Yosuke.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** He's like, all right, here we go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** I do have a question for Chuck.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** You still have the puck stone object.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** And just for clarification, that is the same thing.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:36]** I know we've used multiple words to describe it, but the puck, the stone, the object, they're all one and the same.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** So I'm sorry for the confusion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Still using it as a codpiece, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Got it.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Okay.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** And I'd have to reiterate, Termay is dying.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** He is still unstable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** Yeah, we have to protect the...

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Someone heal to me, for God's sake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Does somebody want to stabilize me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Can.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Let me just double check where we are in turn order.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** Technically, we're out of initiative.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Are we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:03]** I think the only person who can stabilize is Chuck, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** So there's stabilize as a spell, I believe, or a skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** No, it's a medicine check.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Oh, you can also do a medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Right.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Or you can burn a resolve point to stabilize yourself.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** There is a magic thing for it, but I don't know if anyone has it or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** I mean, treat deadly wound.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** Ralu does not have a medicine skill.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Don't you have resolve?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Are you out of resolve?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Yeah, I got resolve.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** I can do, I can burn a resolve point.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** I didn't just burn a resolve point because there's no danger.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:32]** No one has to attack anyone, but you're saying I got burn resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Definitely not a finite resource.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Um, yeah, I mean, I've got medicine trained.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** We could probably make that happen.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** So does somebody want to, I mean, we're coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:44]** Well, I mean, Ralu starts to walk forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:47]** I'll just walk in and check on the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Sure.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Sure.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:55]** As Rolu starts walking slowly, and as we're walking in... I'm dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** You're going to be fine.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** You're going to be fine.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** To me?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Rolu's on his way.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Just take it easy, man.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** You'll be all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** So Thaddeus steps into the lab and is standing over to me.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:13]** He's kind of actually working his way around the giant body of Dotrulu.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** And Rolu stops at the door with chalk on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** He's just walking slowly.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** Chuck, you're going to need to go save Treme.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** But Chuck, Treme will be fine.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:32]** But Rolo looks at his arm, and as he's walking, the tattoo on his arm of some coordinates, it begins to change and shift.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** And he considers his options.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** This is a critical moment.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** And as he's walking, he's like, Treme, we're coming.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Thaddeus, keep him stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:50]** And he's just walking purposefully, and he says... Can I roll perception to see if I notice the coordinates changing?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Absolutely.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:57]** Well, that was a Kev call, but... That's a Kevin question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** Kev?

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Pretend like I'm not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** Cool.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** I'm already checked out.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** This is not what I signed up for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** There's the GM senioritis we were looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:31]** yeah yeah um that's a one on the die for eight with an eight perception what i noticed i mean i i think you yeah you might see something happening like tattoos that move is not new yeah but you might not know what it is right so like i would see the tattoo changing but i wouldn't recognize it as coordinates

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:52]** yeah or as like anything like you you're not quite sure what that is there's no significance to you to you exactly cool and i'm still dying uh yes this is happening very slowly it's okay because i'm just trying to get there to me sounds fine he's he's talking dc 15 message i mean

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** We're getting there.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** This is all happening in real time.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** You don't even know this is happening.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** He's like, Chuck, you need to go save Timmy.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** This is very important.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** But here's the thing.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** I'm not going back to the Caduceus.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** And you know this.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** I'm going to leave once we save Vahri.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** So consider this.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** And he's just starting to get to the door.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:16]** That's right into the vestibule when he steps over the threshold as he says, come with me.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** Come speak with the veil.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Come help save the future of this packed world.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** We'll bring the puck to them.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** We'll discover the meaning, its purpose.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:34]** We'll find out what we can do to save others and perhaps even a friend as well.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** We can do good with this.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:47]** consider this and he's walking through the vestibule as he walks into the final room with the drift engine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:09]** As you're walking in, if anyone is watching Rolu and Chak walk in, you notice the vines across above where Chak's eyes are are furrowed and concerned and a bit confused and conflicted, quite honestly.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:15]** Whether or not this is...

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:33]** and another quite honestly, very juicy adventure for Chuck to, to embark on, or if this is yet another betrayal from his, uh, his XO from his cop, excuse me, another betrayal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** So you could roll us.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** So I could roll it.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** You know what?

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** I'm going to roll a sense motive before I'm just going to let too many die.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** We'll do that.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** Um,

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** That's an 18 on the die plus 4 for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** He seems genuine.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:57]** it seems like his comment of like, we're going to go help a friend.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:05]** You're like, okay, I don't know what that is, but you can, he's now had three little like moments with you.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:09]** The first one was trying to show you that the free captains are not good people.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:17]** The second one was telling you that the veil of the seer are good people because they Rolu knows how he is going to die.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:20]** And the veil of the seer has like, it's like helped him.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** You're not quite sure like they're involved in avoiding that.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:34]** And then now he is saying like this, the free captains, what's going on here doesn't do any good.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:38]** And if you want to do some good, there's an opportunity here for you.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** And he trusts you.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:46]** You feel like he's choosing to bring you in and he has not chosen to bring Thaddeus Intermediate in.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Well, yeah, to step away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** He's bringing you into the veil, quite literally.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Very, very.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Jack is intrigued.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** But all right.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** All right.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** First things first.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Let's get to me breathing again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:06]** Thaddeus is pushing down on the blood spewing.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** He's trying to press down pressure.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Hurry up.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Good God.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Someone help him.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** We're here.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** This is not my forte.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Roll a medicine check.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** That is a nine.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Fail.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** I fail.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** So you have to burn a resolve point to stabilize yourself.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Can you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** I can't.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** I can't.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** This is too big.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** There's just too much damage here.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** I can't do this myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** So I spent... I think that's fair.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:39]** You took a giant Dashko to the chest.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** That was a big swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** You can administer first aid.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** You don't have to be trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** So you can all try to roll it.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Yeah.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** So we should all try and roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** Is this like a raw 20 or something?


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Just roll.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Well, yeah, if you don't have anything in your first aid, then you just roll with a zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** Thaddeus is like trying to, but he only rolls a 10.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:08]** So he's just like fumbling around, like trying to like, I don't know, use gauze or something.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** It's just all bloody and gross.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** I don't know if it's enough.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** What's the DC?

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Just roll it, John.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Just roll it.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** Just roll it.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Rolu bends down, sees Thaddeus.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Thaddeus, let me help.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:29]** Starts to try to stop your bleeding and rolled a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** That's enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** So for a second, he's like, I don't know if it worked.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** And then like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** So wait, I'm stable, I'm still not conscious.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** You're just not dying any longer.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:52]** So mechanically, rather than spending an RP to stabilize and another to stay in the fight to get one HP, you only have to spend one to stay in the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** Or one of you can heal him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Or one of us can heal him.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** But he needs HP to get up.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** Can anybody cure HP or have a healing serum?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** I, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** You see on Treme's body.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** He has like 15.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** He's got a Mark I healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** He's got a bandolier of just healing serums going down his chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Well, well, well to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** I just had two.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** I got two total.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:26]** He just like takes one and then Thaddeus takes one and shoves it into him.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** But I need the, I need the both.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Uh-huh, uh-huh, for sure.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** All right, I'm putting one inside of your body.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Can you roll, please?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** It's a 1d8.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Really earning that Achilles attack today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** I'm sorry.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** It's all right.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** I didn't say where.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** You have to take the top off of it.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** You can't just put the vinyl in.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Am I rolling?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Who's rolling?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** I guess I could roll.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** I think the administer-er rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Whoever administers rolls, right?

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** Yeah.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** Yeah.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Good lord.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** Sorry, one second.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Roll 1d8.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Nine.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Four.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** I'll take four.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Nice.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** And I'm going to hop back over a little short.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Get out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Hey, guys.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** How's it going?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** What's your HP at, man?

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Roughly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Four.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** My HP's at four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** What's your stamina, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** I'm pretty wiped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** From zero to 26, how are you feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:25]** Yeah, right.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** So Treme is up again.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** But you guys are still in the Stellar Flare.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:36]** Just to remind you, you didn't pick up the watch that Vari8 used and left.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** We should maybe do that.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:45]** The watch that was on Vari8 was soldered into the computer and being used by the Grey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Gotcha.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** I thought I grabbed that one.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Yeah, I thought you did too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** I don't believe you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** For story purposes, I'm going to hop off of Rolu's shoulder and go grab the watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** You have the watch.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** Look, we're in a bit of a pickle.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** A kefak dog.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** A bad one, if you will.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** We are here and we need to leave.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:14]** But Vahri... Well, Vahri is being held hostage by Tez Cronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** We'll take care of the android.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** At least we have the technology.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:22]** Thaddeus is, like, putting his, like, foot on, like, the face of Deltrulu.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** He's like, you were all bluster, weren't you?

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:30]** And, uh, to me... And he's gonna check the body for some stuff.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** Oh, great words.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** No, no.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** I don't have Jason Keeley here to say anything, so... Do your best impression.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** You've done bad against Enrolloo impressions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** It's not fair.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** It's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** Enrolloo's going to step into the vestibule to watch this spectacle.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Roll your d100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** One.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Six.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Goddamn.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** Yeah, Jason Keeley should have been here to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** I know, right?

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Thank you for your f***ing grave words.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** So rude.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** I hate grave words so much.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** It's the reason I'm quitting GMing.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** It's so great.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** JK, it was good.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** Thaddeus is going to look onto his body real quick.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** There might be like syrups or something.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Wink, wink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** I don't know.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Yeah.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Can we search his body now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** I'm working on it.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** Yes, you can just roll out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Do you want this dashko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** That is... He has two dashkos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:36]** I literally have so many weapons on me, but thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** I'll take one.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** I don't know if I can use it.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** But it might fetch a price.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Dude, okay.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:49]** I can't get the mental image of, like, check the tiny Raxalite holding a medium dashko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** LAUGHTER


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** Just like Kirby with the super hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** And the crossbow's cool.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** I want the crossbow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** Right, so he has a squad defense series.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** I believe that's his armor.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** And then he has Ember Dashko with two batteries.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:11]** And then he has a tactical cross bolter with 20 arrows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** And he used like 10 of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Just assume there's 20 arrows there.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Or round up.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Cross bower is what it's called?

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Cross bolter.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Oh, okay.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** I'm just going to look it up real quick.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** What kind of armor do you have?

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** I believe it's a squad defense series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** I'm assuming that's the armor.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:31]** I'll take the cross bolter.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** I'll roll for it.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** If you want to roll for it, that's fine.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** I rolled an eight.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** I win the roll, sir.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Okay.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Twelve.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** But you could take this armor, man.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** You've been a little bit.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** I don't know if I could wear it.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** I'm going to look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:51]** I think you would have to do an engineering check because he's definitely a large creature, so you'd have to resize it to yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** I'll do an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:58]** I think there's something where it takes some time or it takes like an hour or something.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Like we don't have to spend time on it.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** We can look up and see what it is.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:13]** While you all are doing that, Chalk, I think, you know, came back to Rulu's shoulder and they're just, Rulu's like leaning against the open vestibule, looking at them go through and trying to figure out.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:19]** And he just says to Chalk very quietly, he says, what's your answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** You see, just as much as you see, you feel.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Chalk, take a deep sigh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** It's okay if you don't have one, but we don't have much time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** I can feel the urgency.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** I know you're sincere.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:47]** If you believe this stone is going to save the universe somehow...

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** I mean, it seems like we're almost done here.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:54]** I was getting pretty bored on the Caduceus anyway.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Let's go save the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** Is there going to be like a shock and Rolu in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** What's going on here, guys?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** Hey, what y'all talking about over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** Just watching you work on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:18]** You beautiful, beautiful cat man, you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** What?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Well, we have to save someone.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Be cool.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Time is of the essence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** Everything you touch like turns to suspiciousness.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** That's all I got to say, man.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** We have to spend less time with shock.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** I got to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** We need to save Vahri.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** This is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** All right, dude.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** To me, you want this armor?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** I feel like it could be good for you, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Is it the hard light series squad armor?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** My previews decided to crash real hard.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** I'll take it.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** Why don't we give the lowest level?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** Termei had legit inspiration for what he did last time.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** He could maybe shorten the time that it takes to get this f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Is it the hard light series armor, though?

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** I'm going to look it up.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Because that's the only thing that I could see for squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** It's a squad.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** I have it up.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** There it goes.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** Okay.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:21]** So it's a defense series is the armor, and it's the squad version.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** So there's defense series elite, defense series specialist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:37]** It is a bonus EAC plus 5, KAC plus 8, max dex of plus 1, armor penalty minus 4, speed adjustment is minus 10, I believe so.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** You know, it doesn't say.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** It is heavy armor.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** No, it definitely does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** It says adjusting armor.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:52]** If you get secondhand armor that wasn't tailored for you, you can have it adjusted, which requires a successful engineering check.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** 10 plus 2 times the armor's level.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** It doesn't say anything about how long it takes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:12]** right so we'll we'll just assume it's the time it takes to put it on so if you want to use that it is a minus 10 to your your speed is all i'm going to point out but yes so you'll give me a uh i'm not proficient in heavy armor is a problem


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:33]** oh okay so is anybody i mean i am but i i don't want to take all of this it just seems kind of weird because unlike rolu thaddeus cares about you know the whole crew so you can just like spread around for sure yeah for sure for sure yeah totally let's see so while you guys are debating over this armor we have thaddeus and rolu are still inside the lab


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** And we're overhearing this, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Well, I'm going to say that Rolo stepped back.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:43]** He's actually inside the airlock behind that door, the door frame.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** So the door is open, but he stepped back into that airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** Where are you going, Rolo?

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** And he's got chalk on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** I'm literally standing here.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I'm not going anywhere.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** I'm just watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** I think he's far enough away that he wouldn't hear that conversation they had, unless you roll a really high perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:07]** On our way out, Thaddeus is actually, like, you know, being a weapons officer and being very good at that, he's just like, ah, you know what?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:15]** Actually, the crossbow, the tactical, the crossbow to tactical, I think it's only, like, about 10 damage, roughly.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:20]** Come to think of it, that is less than my 40 of Venocaster.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** You know, to me, why don't you take this after all?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** Can you handle a heavy unwieldy weapon?

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** Probably not.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Well, it's not heavy.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Unwieldy.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** We'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** Unwieldy just means that you can't do a full attack with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** All right, thanks.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** I knew that being the weapons officer.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Here you are, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** What's the cross bolter?

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** What's it called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Cross bolter tactical.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** It suits you.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** Thaddeus, I thought you cared about the crew.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Time is of the essence.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** You're just talking about equipment.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Yeah, crossbow is protectable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** It's a 1d10 damage, range of 70.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Yes.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Requires long arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** 70 is a pretty nice range.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** It's pretty good.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** Then he... What was the name of the armor again, bro?

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Kevo?

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** Starfinder Squad Defiance Series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** I think we're spending too much time on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Yeah, I know, I know.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Here we go.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:10]** For someone who cares about their crew, you're really just dialoguing a lot.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** You know what?

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** My God.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** I...

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** I'm getting angry on behalf of Thaddeus.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** I'm trying to control my rage right now.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** Yeah, he's going to put on the Defiant Series armor, okay?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** All right, cool.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Rolu, we're getting tied up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Okay, all right, all right.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:37]** Rolu says to Chak, Chak, do you think that we can trust that we can get away from them safely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** Why would we want to get away from them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** They're not going to let us go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:45]** I can't use the cross bolter either because I'm not proficient in long arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:14]** alright well Shaq the crossbow I guess I can't do nothing this like tiny body being like actually let's see crossbow tactical 1d10 piercing does it have any arrows with it dope yeah why not Shaq takes it does more damage than his anything else actually drops it leaves his hunting rifle behind and takes the crossbow to

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** You can wheel it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Does it need to be mini or anything?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** No.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:23]** Because of my elephant, I can wield medium weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Nice.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:33]** Alright, so just looking at the list, Dotrulu is dead, Torme is alive, Testronen has Vahri 13.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** What is the plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** You want to save that android, right?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** Yes.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** I care about our crew.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Vahri.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** She's not really our crew.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** I do too.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** They're not our crew, but...

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** We do have the technology that they talked about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:56]** I don't want to be sent down here again to take out another warlord, so let's just do it all at once.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** Let's not commit the sins of that ancient World War II.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** We'll help you.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:10]** Well, it's a good thing that you decided to be a good person for once and help someone in need.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Thank you, Thaddeus.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** I take exception to that.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** I knew that you would, Jermaine.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** It's more Thaddeus, you know.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Cry me a river, Roldu.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Let's just get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** We're all pushing in the same direction.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** Let's rescue Ferry 13.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** We can get back to the ship and settle our differences there.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:37]** I think we might have some next steps to, you know, maybe have some more altruistic goals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Correct.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** And don't forget, we'll do to the brig with you when we're back to the ship.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** All right, let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Very casual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Sure, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:49]** All right, so you guys are together and leaving the Stellar Flare.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** You guys are walking through the halls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** He grabs the bracelet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:53 - 00:35:01]** Yeah, actually, I put an orange dot over chalk to show that he has... I should also put a blue one because he also has the... The stone.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** The stone.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** That way I can keep track of who has the stone.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:09]** Or the object or the puck, just to clarify.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** So you guys are making your way through.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:19]** As you come around that corner, one of you thinks that you glanced and saw possibly one of the ghosts from earlier.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Possibly.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** But you're not sure.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** It was a blur.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** You guys are all tired, fatigued.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** It's been a long day.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:33]** And as you guys start to come around that corner and down that main corridor to the front...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Hang on.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** Guys, should we take a few minutes to rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Do we have ten minutes to rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Do we?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** Do we have ten minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** I don't know.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** I want to save Vahri.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** I don't know that they're in a situation to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:54]** I want to see what this red brand wants to say, but I don't want to piss off the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Kev, can we take a 10-minute rest?

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** You guys do what you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:04]** Okay, but does it feel like... It's a little like, hey, so outside somebody's like... You're the precog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** You tell me, man.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** I'm going to shoot this person, and you're like, we'll be right there.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** It's fine.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Hold on.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Hold on 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** No, we're on our way, and we're actually getting in the shower.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** So all you guys know is that

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:25]** Tez Tronin took Varya 13 out of the Starflare.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** That's all you know.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** To, like, dinner?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** They could be long gone for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** I'm going to check.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** If you need to wait, wait.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** I'm going to check.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:42]** I can't just see the future easily, even mechanically, like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** I love that Rolu's talking to the GM right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** This is great.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** It's just Rolu shouting him off.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** I can't just see the future.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** It doesn't work like that.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** I have all these tools.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** He points to his tattoos to help me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** So, okay.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:02]** So we have Thaddeus and Torme are going to kind of stay back and you have Rolu moving down.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Chalk, you're staying on his shoulder.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** Yep.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Can I do this dude's body real quick?

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Which dudes?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Just like the people as they walk.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Sure.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** He's got a pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Africa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** Not worth it.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** We picked up some ammo.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Cool.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:27]** So as you get to that scanner at the front, the disabled scanner, you look out, and there's the doorway in front of you that exits the stellar flare, and you see the setting sun.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:33]** And then there's a large silhouette that eclipses it.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** And on your map, you can probably see it.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** Why don't you roll me a perception check?


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** Who is rolling, Kevin?

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** TremÃ© and Thaddeus can't roll because they're too far back.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** It would be Rolu or Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** TremÃ© and Thaddeus resting?

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Oh, you guys are moving up too?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Oh, you're all moving.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** Okay, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** I rolled a 22, y'all.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** I rolled a 24, naturally, better than Thaddeus.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** I rolled a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:13]** Standing in the doorway, you see a tough true warrior.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:18]** But he's in power armor, fashioned together from metal scrap.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** There's a large tank on his back and pipes billowing steam and smoke over each of his shoulders.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:27]** There's spikes that jut out from every plate of armor.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:32]** His hands are clad in steel, and you can see electricity arcing from one fist to the other.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** While it is junk, this armor does have a handsome aesthetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** Handsome Jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** That's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Glad it's fashionable.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Can I make a guess?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** I want to make the guess, but I don't want to spoil the reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** Make the guess.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** What are you guessing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Is this Michael?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** I don't want to... That's close.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** It's very close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Any other guesses?

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Riddle.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Anyone?

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** If it's Michael, that is going to be pissed off, dude.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** This guy not only did not help us, now he's working against us.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Do you guys remember any other tough true warriors?

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** The one that ran off.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:15]** Oh, the guy with the dead S.O.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** The one whose S.O.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** was killed by... Oh, no.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** By Tinkerton.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Now we're going to have to kill him, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** Kevin, I was expecting one more battle.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Why don't we have two more?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** All right, I figured out.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Look, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Ready?

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Oh, bad ass.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:38]** Yeah, it is pretty.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** It's like a junk.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Junk armor.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Who?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Who is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** Who are you?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Identify yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:53]** Oh, dude, I'm so sorry that we killed your girlfriend.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** I'm really sorry about that, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Wait, is it that?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Oh, he's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** I don't think we did kill his girlfriend.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** We didn't.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** It was Tinker.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** She just died.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Oh, yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** Don't just take responsibility for killing people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** And so he's going to stomp forward, I guess.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** You all are standing just on the other side of that scanner.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** And he steps forward just one square.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** He's in the middle of that front airlock.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** What are you guys doing?

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Should I roll initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Who are you?

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Identify yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** He doesn't respond, and he steps closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Is the door in front of the scanner gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** Yeah, that door is open and gone.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** Okay.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** So it's just the scanner there.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:39]** And even that glass, I think, was broken through when Del Trullo came plowing through.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** So you guys are about 15 feet away from this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** Do a quick engineering check on this turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** I believe it was completely shattered by the trailer.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** We're going to fire if you don't identify yourself.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** You are a threat until proven otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** That's some pretty menacing armor you got there, pal.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** You want to talk about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** You guys are ready action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** It'd be a nice, it'd be a terrible tomb for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** I'm just going to ready.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:16]** That is going to ready an action just to like shoot the moment that it does literally anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:21]** I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to ready a guarded step for if it attacks me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Yeah.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Good idea.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** I guess I'll ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** Oh, thanks.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Thanks.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** So he's going to take one step closer.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** He starts to like squeeze through that broken doorway.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** And as he does, you hear...

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Oh, thanks you all my day.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** It's you.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** I can't see this thing.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** And he, he kind of like tries to lift his helmet and it comes up just a little bit.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:55]** And it is in fact, Michael, that was a great guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** Oh my God.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** Michael, where are you doing pal?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** Michael, you gave us a bit of a fright there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:09]** And Yosuke kind of peeks around from behind the behemoth and it's Riddle.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Oh, Riddle.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** You guys are alive.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:16]** I mean, like, I knew you would be, but like, hey, you were supposed to be protecting Vahri 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** Yeah, we came out here to protect Vahri.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Where are they?

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Are they okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** They're fine.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** And they start stepping back.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Oh.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Oh.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** As you guys walk out of the Stellar Flare, let me move maps.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** This is so pleasant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** I'm very happy.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** I thought we were going to fight someone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** I thought we had to save Ari as well.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** I know.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** This is nice.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** You guys remember when Deb let us take a 10-minute rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Yeah.

**[00:42:43 - 00:43:05]** and pick up armor and debate weapons uh so as you all exit the stellar flare you do see some true warriors they're actually tied up including the unconscious tez tronin well it turns out we don't have to do absolutely everything in this story wow amazing yeah wow very crazy

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:10]** Around all those tied up true warriors, there are goblins that Keshi's pointing knives and dog slicers at them.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** Bomb Gozzle is actually standing over Tez Tronin very menacingly.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:23]** And over to the side, you see Keshi tending to the very damaged and broken Vary 13 as they sit against a rock.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Merc kind of scurries over to where you guys are too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:31]** Chokhov's down next to Vary 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:35]** Hey, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** I'm fine.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:42]** Did you find what we thought was in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** Oh, you mean this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** And he pulls out the watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** What does he pull out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:52]** He pulls out the watch and he shows it to Vahri 13.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** You've done it.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:59]** I have no idea if the theories presented here are viable.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** After all, Vahri 8 was the scientist.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:09]** But if they are, this could bring safe and reliable and cheap energy to the entire galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** How spectacular.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Is this what you need?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:19]** I mean, based on what that gray said in there, I think this is what you're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** What?

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** A gray?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:26]** And before we go any further with that, Vahri talking to the rest of you.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** I mean, sorry, Riddle talking to the rest of you.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Vahri was sending me these updates.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:37]** I knew you all made it inside, but when Vahri stopped responding, that's when I armored up Michael and got it.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** And we both headed out here.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:42]** We found all these Akashis and goblins hiding in the rocks as we arrived.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** And that's when Merc speaks up.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** Yeah, that's when I told her what happened.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** We lost Pac-Pac and Susan.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** And she does a little symbol of rest in peace.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** And the true warriors, they caught Kesha.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Oh, I'm so scared.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** I didn't want to lose you.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** And Merc turns back and buries her head into Kesha's chest.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** And he blushes and puts an arm around her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Wait, did they officially get together because I shipped them?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Same.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Are they a thing now, Kevin?

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Merc and Kesha?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:17]** You do what to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I ship them.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** It means I want them to be a couple.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:23]** They're officially a couple in my head canon.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** Whatever goes on in your own head is your own thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:34]** I'm asking the official thing because otherwise I'll have to write a fan fiction for it or something.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** You guys together now.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** You guys seem, I guess, good as roleplay.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Hey, is something going on with y'all?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:46]** After all the violent death and destruction, it would be kind of nice if some love would blossom.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:49]** You know, it's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:55]** It's like a violent encounter to make you think about what's important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:03]** I don't want to think about what... I'm just happy he's alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** I'm glad you're okay, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** That's very sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** And they both blush.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** Jack looks on wistfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** You two, you two have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** And he hops on Rolly's shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Crazy kids.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** Is Quirrell around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:28]** Oh, yeah, Rolly's love interest.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:31]** You and Rolly deserve some love every now and then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Quirrell didn't make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** Oh, really?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:42]** It's one of those moments where like the crowd's moving and Rilla's like, oh, and then suddenly.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Yeah.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:49]** You can actually see it's like the true, one of the true warriors falls over and on the other side is Cordal.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:55]** Back when we recorded that episode, I did not play Quirtle, and now I play it daily.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Thank you, John, for informing me.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** I just made that name up altogether.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** It was great.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:05]** All right, so back to what Chalk was telling Vary13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** What do you mean there was a gray?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** Chalk turns to Rolu and the rest of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** They're called grays, right?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** That is what we found?

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** Yeah, gray?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:37]** yeah that's what i think yeah little little round-headed gray rubbery looking dude yeah you know a whole lot about the the drift and what we were trying to get some really far-fetched ideas about uh killing us and doing things you know kind of think of it they didn't seem too far-fetched everyone's trying to kill us since we've got here do you have any experience with them laurie


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:42]** No, everything that I have heard about them is strictly myth and legend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:50]** Well, there's a legend in the chamber of this laboratory inside the Stellar Flare, if anyone's interested.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** This is huge.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** What were they doing in there?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Trying to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:14]** They wanted to access the drift with technology that I'm no expert, but it seems like they wanted to access the drift and were able to conjure some sort of extra-dimensional being.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** It was very strange.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:21]** You would need time to go in there, but it's still not the best place to go, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** They did that, too.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** They made some zombies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:29]** Yeah, there's ghosts in there, too, apparently, but I don't know how they fit into the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Don't follow the ghosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Yeah, don't follow the ghosts.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:37]** It might be good if we can get this door back up and seal this up.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** It's probably best that no one else goes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** It's best a tomb.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** As religious shrines go, it's not super ideal, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** I have heard of spirits related to the drift.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:55]** If the Grey was trying to use Varya 8's information to open the drift in any way, it could cause such anomalies.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** Drift dead are a very common feature of drift travels.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** Would have been good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Yeah, I wish you told us before they almost killed us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:10]** I... It's cool.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** I don't think I could have made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** No, yeah.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Nah, that's true.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** You probably would have died from the turret, right?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Right, y'all?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Yeah, most likely, for once, Fari.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** It's okay.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** We are glad that you're safe.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** We're glad you're safe, Fari.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Oh, yeah, man.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** If you guys would have invited her in.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Jesus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** Jack is still pissed she didn't say anything about the drift dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:36]** So, uh, like, the true warriors, they, and that big ugly Shabbat, they're out of the way.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Like, Junker's Delight can open back up again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** I'll need to find some guides, though.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Any of you interested?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:50]** And as she says that, Michael's power armor hisses and creaks, and you see his big metal hand raise up.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Looks like Michael's in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** I kind of want to get off this s*** planet.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Sorry, no offense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:00]** I mean, I love the food here, but I got places to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:06]** Yeah, I think Roman and I might have another place to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:10]** And he winks really obviously at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:16]** Treme, though you can't see because he's masked, is going to give you a shifty eye.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:20]** What do you... We're all going back to the ship, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Do you ask this in your mind, Link?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:51]** to Chuck yes what's going on here Chuck so like this is all via mind link Chuck says there's more to this rock than we originally knew Rolo's telling the truth this rock is the key to saving the universe we could really use your help will you join us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:51 - 00:51:17]** don't know about that i this is news to me you gotta understand i know and i i i know that you and thaddeus don't trust ro at all but as much as you trust me is as far as i would ask you to go with us man that's quite a plea uh i don't know think about it i won't ask for an answer right now we will need to know soon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:23]** So you're kind of interrupted as Merc pulls away from Kesha's arms.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Sir, did you bring me anything?

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:31]** She's got big eyes and her hands are kind of low and out and open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** Someone to think of something quick.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** Someone to get something.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** From a metagaming perspective, did we bring her anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** Guys, Mark was looking for something shiny, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** I love shiny stuff.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** I love anything that tinkles and winkles and blinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** You know who picks up a lot of things?

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Termay.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** Just always the most thoughtful for picking up equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** I didn't pick up anything shiny, though.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** I just barely got out of here alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** Termay, you've got to give... There has to be something that you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** I've got...

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** I've got good news and I've got bad news.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** The bad news is we didn't bring anything.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** The good news is we cleared out all of the ads in there.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** So go forage to your heart's content.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** We don't want them.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** It's not safe, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** What's an ad?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** What's that shiny thing on your chest?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Is that a badge?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Where'd you get badges from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** There's a badge printer in there?

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Give him the badge, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:45]** she becomes so ecstatic she dances with glee hopping on one foot and cash starts to apologize for her enthusiasm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** It's quite all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:53]** I just want to thank you guys for everything he says to you.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** It's a place of peace now.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** And we only have you to thank for that, junk loads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Well, you know what they say.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** Free captains always bring peace wherever they go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Is that what they say?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:12]** That is what they say, although I sort of feel like we didn't believe it while he was saying it.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** But yeah, that is true.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** No, I did.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** We bring no order, if nothing else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Did any of us believe that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** That's a little... I don't know that everyone feels that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** But peace.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** Yeah, peace.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** Voluntary association.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Oh, Termay, always the philosopher.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** If you ever need anything, call us.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** Can I have your number?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:39]** I thought I... I've got a digital business card.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** They're new from the Free Captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Oh, nice.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** It's got a QR code?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** Or is it like a ZR now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** You could go on my Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** All right.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** So you guys are all just kind of like, it's settling, right?

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Chaos ensued.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** Things are calm now for the first time in who knows how long.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** And that's when you guys are kind of separated a little bit.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** And as things settle, two goblins actually walk up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** To who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** To all of you.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** They probably direct it mostly at TremÃ©.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** Well, glad you guys came.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** No way we could have gotten those desert goblins to fight back against the true warriors.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:31]** And that Rivna, now that it's gone, I think it'd be a lot easier to control this area.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Thank you, guys.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Just be against a dozen stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** And they wink at you.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** And as they turn away, they start to get... Their demeanor changes immediately.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:46]** They get more obnoxious and start laughing and giggling and shouting and gobbling as they walk away and rejoin the others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:53]** Well, looks like we've brought this small town to a good place.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** We did some good here.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Let's get off this rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Agreed.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:06]** Brolu's going to quietly say to Chuck, Chuck, we need to not go back to the Caduceus.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** We need to form a plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** So what are you guys doing?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:18]** I know you guys head back and do all your piratey nonsense and everything, but if you guys want to come back to Junkers for the night, you guys are welcome to stay there until you wait for your shuttle.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** I know the next shuttle's probably not until tomorrow, and the sun is setting.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** It's getting late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** Guys, we've completed our mission, right?

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** Let's go out and celebrate like pirates do over rum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** To me, you could use the rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Yeah, I could use some rest.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:38]** I don't know if I'm really up to going out and hitting the bars, but... That's fine.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:42]** I do want some spicy food from Junkers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** That's... Let's celebrate with some Kefak dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Let's get back to town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** All right, so is that what you guys are doing?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** You're heading back to town?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** We all head back to town.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Yeah, I mean, well, we're not going to stay here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** What are you guys doing with the True Warriors?

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Are you guys all heading back as like a caravan?

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** You're guiding them back?

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** And shackles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:04]** What will become of these true warriors, Mark Cash?

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Riddle, what do you think?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Riddle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** I mean, if it's up to me, I'd turn them in.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** I could call my cousin Cecil.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** He works for Avidocor.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:15]** You know, they got their security teams that could come out and round these guys up, put them where they belong.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** You know, prison or whatever they do to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Rehabilitation program.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** That's what I was thinking, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Rehabilitations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** I didn't like that you made the quotes there.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** What do you mean by quotes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** I mean, like, can you really rehabilitate a bunch of gangsters?

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Maybe.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** You either die the hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Are you saying I'm a villain?

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** I'm saying you might be eventually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** Everyone needs a redemption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** I'm taking notes on that.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Riddle is the villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:57]** I think they deserve a chance at rehabilitation, so if this Cecil... Listen, there was this experiment at Stanford.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** God, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** What's Stanford?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:02]** Is that some big fancy place on Avalon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:27]** never mind it's fine it's fine look just make sure that they are sent and given opportunity to come back into society in a productive perhaps if they're not thrown into a role of a red brand they might discover they have passions for new things exactly if i might because i've got a little bit of experience in politics maybe we appoint michael as an ambassador to the true warriors to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:32]** To bring them into the fold rather than just mercilessly killing them all off at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** To reintegrate them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Yes.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:41]** And then perhaps if they don't want to and they still, well, he's got that power armor.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** I mean, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** Right.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:49]** And as you say that, he's actually like trying to take his helmet off and he trips over a rock, falls backwards.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** The helmet rolls.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** He's like, help.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Help.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Someone.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I can't get up.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** My God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:08]** We'll figure out the process for the director of this reintegration from the true warriors back into society.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:15]** It would be good if they served in some capacity under Goldhorn with his newly established presence here.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** Re-established presence, I should say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Did you say re-established?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Re-established.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** Instead of re-established, it's re-established?

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Re-established.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Re-established.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:52]** we'll be in touch therefore with you michael most likely because uh you know this is now gold world's land again yep look out for a very terse and short email that will tell you what to do probably not from gold horn but it'll be very vague yes and one of those two goblins is like watching you guys nodding have you ever been a director of anything goblin your name


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:57]** I'm just one of the trash hunters, man.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** I just hang out.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Baumgasel's the leader.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** What are you looking at me for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** You seemed interested, I just thought.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Don't limit your potential.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** I'll think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** What was your name again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** I didn't catch it.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** Um, Piktar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Piktar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** It's like Pixar, but with a T. What's a Pixar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Yeah, what's a Pixar?

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** None of your business.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:23]** It's this thing I'm working on on the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Some Trash Hunters thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** Tell good stories, I bet.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** It sounds like it won't, you know, turn into anything.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Definitely not.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Really substantial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** No.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** The Trash Hunters don't have that kind of platform.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Don't tell that to them, though.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** We've walked away from now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Definitely.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:44]** It's important to, like, keep your dreams alive when you live in, like, a, you know, desert wasteland and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Right, exactly.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** That's the only way.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** Hope, really, is what it's all about.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** That's all they have here.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Moisture farms.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** I'm glad that you and I see eye to eye on something that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** Thaddeus casually on Kefauk Depot.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** It's so funny.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** He's so tired of this place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** He's trying not to spit a beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** Okay, so you guys are basically leaving the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:23]** You're convincing the others to work with... We are empowering the goblins and the Ikeshti to do what they will with the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:31]** It's up to you to secure your own future, but just know that Goldhorn will be back anytime that there is disruption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:42]** This is a new structure, but there is a chance and an opportunity for everybody to thrive when they use their skills for the good of Kefauk Depot.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Yeah, what he said, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:48]** I think you get kind of a large, like everyone now is nodding.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** They're like, they don't quite understand what you're implying, but they're like, all right, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** Don't worry, I won't kick anybody over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** Baumgalsen gives you a hard side eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** He looks at Ralu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** Too soon, Ralu, too soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Sorry, sorry.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** I was just trying to make light of it, you know, like you do.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** All right, let's go drink.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** That helps everything be easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:18]** So are you saying that they should bring back the true warriors with you or the four of you are going to take off separately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** I think the four of us are heading back to town.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Yep.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** They're going to do with the true warriors what they're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** Sounds like Riddle had a connection.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:30]** And Tez Tronin, I mean, what's her deal?

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** She's unconscious.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** She's unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:49]** Is she going to... I'm not trying to play too hard into it, but like a famous film, I picture Tez Tronin was hanging up Vare 13 and what you thought was the bad guy came along and knocked out Tez Tronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Okay.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Almost like Chuck described it.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:52]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:58]** Do you think that, like, Tez Tronin would be a threat if she were to awaken?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:03]** I think... So Bomb Guzzle is, like, the one of all the goblins.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** Bomb Guzzle is the one overlooking Tez Tronin.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** And I guess Michael would probably assist in that.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:13]** So if you're worried about her escaping, I don't think you need to be concerned about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:18]** Yeah, I think, you know, I don't want to...

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:28]** I'm not, like Dotrolu, I'm not here to wet my dashko on the blood of my enemies, as long as they've disbanded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:36]** It's honestly not our responsibility, but as long as they don't get in the way of Goldhorn's activities, we're good.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:41]** And I can trust that, look, there's enough of these guys, and they're going to handle it all right.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:46]** I think they want to secure their own future, which is just... Let's go back...

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** Relax.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Get ready to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Exactly.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]** Check turns to Merc and Cash and Riddle and Michael and says, all right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** You guys got it from here?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** I mean, we'll take care of this area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** I think we can handle that.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:09]** And so I think the plan now for kind of just giving you all the NPC planning is Kesh and Merc, they live in this region.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:13]** This is their, not territory, but this is their home.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** And so Merc and Kesh are definitely going to stay behind.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:26]** Riddle and Michael are going to lead the pack and almost caravan it with as many goblins and Akeshis are willing to come.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:35]** So you guys can either lead the way or take the back, but they're going to be trailing along and heading back to town.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:45]** And the idea was that Riddle is going to call her cousin Cecil, who works for the Abaddon Corps security forces, and see if they can round up these true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:48]** It sounds like a plan to be, let's head out.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** Yes.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:54]** Thaddeus looks at Merc and Cash and he's like, good luck with whatever the two of you have going on.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** And he kind of like winks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Oh, thanks.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]** And you actually see, as you guys walk away, they clasp hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:04]** Yes, yes, the shipping.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** Oh, good.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** It's official.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** It's canon.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** It's canon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** You do love to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** I don't care what Jason Keeley says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** It's a junk canon.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** It's a junk canon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:18]** It's a junk canon.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]** Alright, so you guys are heading out.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** I don't have a map for this.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Let me hold on.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** I'm just going to throw us up on the... I don't think we need one.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** Yeah.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** Okay, moving us to another map.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** It's imaginary maps.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:28]** Good.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:29]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:32]** Well, you can still put up the Junkers Delight city, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** Oh, I was gonna... Yeah, oh, like... Or the outer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Do you, Kev?

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Yeah, you do you, buddy.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** Take a victory lap, Kev.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** You did it.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:41]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** Yeah, we're not done here.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:44]** Oh, look, we're back.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:47]** It's been so long since I've seen this map.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** What are all these reds of?

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** Are these red brands?

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:53]** Do we pass by Snakeboy on the way back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** Stop it.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Ignore everything that's on the map.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:57]** Okay, so you guys are making your way back.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** You guys are far enough ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** I've dropped you on a map, but I want you to ignore everything you see.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** Because I didn't prep this map.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** Dude, we never saw a frog.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** We never saw a frog battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** I hate GMing.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** What do you want us to do?

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:22]** As you guys are making your way back to Kefauk Depot, I'm assuming you're going to stay the night at Junkers Delight.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** What about Goldhorn?

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Are you guys going to tell him anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:30]** I don't know that Chuck would stay at Junkers tonight, first.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:37]** Second, to answer your second question, I think Chuck would send a text message to the captain.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:56]** uh on the way back to junkers just to to you know basically bang out i guess i'll do it in character mission accomplished dotrulu has been killed stellar flare has been explored we rescued the android all is well in junkers delight


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:21]** i think the horn doesn't have any context for the cellar flare or anything right i think the the moment he receives that message you guys are still walking along like chuck you send that off like it's no big deal hey captain we're done click and and within it's almost like a minute like by the time he reads it he is calling uh chuck says it's voicemail


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:33]** Let me retcon that a little bit.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Chuck doesn't hit the FU button.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** He lets it go to voicemail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** He lets it go to voicemail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** He just ignores it.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** That's a very different experience.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** He lets it go to voicemail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:48]** Chuck, you notice the pulsing stop as you just ignore it.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** And then Termay's phone rings next.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:54]** I pick it up.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:59]** And the hologram of Goldhorn comes booming to life.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** He is there and in presence.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** He's a large noir.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:08]** Even though he's holographic, he is intimidating as all can be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:11]** So, TremÃ© picks up the phone.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** Coldhorn comes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:18]** Oh, why won't Chalk pick up his phone, TremÃ©?

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:21]** Give me a status report.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:28]** Uh, I'm sorry, I don't... Maybe he's got a bad connection on his communicator.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:31]** We just got out of a huge fight with this giant f***ing...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:40]** Hearing his name and seeing Goldhorn's gigantic visage, Shaq turns pale.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** Oh, I didn't expect him to call Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:49]** Well, what's your status?

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** Yeah, what's your status?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:56]** Is Thaddeus and Rolu also close enough to hear this?

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:02]** I feel like he's got his wrist up and the projection is actually almost to his top of his head.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]** And I think Torme is probably one of the taller ones of the group, right?

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** I think Rolu is the only one that is taller than him.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:18]** So this hologram of Goldhorn is booming over the four of you as you walk ahead of all the goblins and the Kestis with the true warriors behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:21]** Jack is like, well, I guess the jig is up.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:23]** He hops from Rolu's shoulder to Tremay's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Hey, hey there, Captain.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Hey, how you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:31]** Oh, why didn't you answer my communication?

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:36]** You left some vague detail about some blasted ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:41]** I think my communicator might have got damaged in the battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:44]** And he very obviously throws it over his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** I don't know what's wrong.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:53]** Yeah, what ambiguous thing are you asking answers for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** What's your status?

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:58]** Where are we with this mission?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:58]** We're done.

**[01:08:59 - 01:08:59]** We're good.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Well, you know, we're great here.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:03]** How are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:15]** Well, it took 52, 53 hours longer than I expected, but I'm excited to have you all back on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** Oh, yeah, the ship, right, the Caduceus.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:19]** That's definitely where we're going.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:22]** Um, so we're, uh... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** Great.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** When can I expect you?

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** Thaddeus is just, like, waving dramatically.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:30]** Oh, by the way, Captain, Captain, Rulu's a filthy traitor.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** He's a filthy traitor.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:37]** I have so many things to tell you, and when he's back, we're going to put him in the brig, and you're going to interview him, and oh, my God, there's so much you've got to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:39]** Just, just, just, hold on, but, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:48]** I think you can tell that the excitement of the adventure, Captain, and the heat has gotten to Thaddeus' perception.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** I believe that Torme and Shaq are going to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** Get back here now, both of you, all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:56]** Well, the thing is, Captain, we can't get back there until the next morning.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** All right, Captain.

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:01]** But be sure that I'm going to keep Rulu unlocked out until then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:04]** Torme, make sure they keep in line.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:06]** I don't want any more.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** More disruption or delay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]** That's a wise choice, Captain.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** It's a wise choice.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** Good call.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Thank you for the call, Captain.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** It's good seeing you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:17]** Yes, of course, Captain.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** Yes, Captain.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]** No problem.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:22]** I will make sure that we get out of here as soon as possible.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:23]** We've got to get back.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** I've got to rest.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:29]** I'm pretty worse for wear here.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:33]** And we've got to get transported back to the Caduceus, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:40]** Captain, just to be clear, there are some details that you'll need to follow for the structure underneath your rule.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Take a look at it.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:42]** We'll keep it very brief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** I don't even know why you're talking, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:50]** But suffice to say, your reign has been restored over Kefaktipo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** Very well, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:53]** And we're all done with the tomfoolery.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** You can count on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:56]** I don't know.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]** You didn't pick up my phone call earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Chalk lost.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:03]** Their communicator was damaged in the battle.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** Yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Very well, then.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** Make sure you get that fixed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** We'll find a burner.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Thank you, Captain.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:15]** Roller reaches over and hangs up the call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** No drip beacons and distant stars and nothing?

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:23]** You have to understand, Thaddeus, that the Captain doesn't have time for things, and...

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:27]** It's really, truly a mistake.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]** I cannot wait until tomorrow, Rulu.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** I cannot wait.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:36]** I can't wait till tomorrow either, that is.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:38]** I can't wait either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:40]** I got no idea what to do, y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** I wonder what tomorrow brings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:45]** You keep us in line, isn't that right, Tormain?

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:50]** I don't know about that, but... Well, let's all go get a drink, and Rulu just slaps you on the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]** Yeah, Tormain's gonna take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:11:54 - 01:12:01]** Well, Rulu, since it's your last night of freedom, I'll toast once with you, just to the success of the mission, eh?

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Sure, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** You pick the bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:06]** You guys make it back to Kefak Depot.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:10]** I forget the name of the area.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Oh, what was it called?

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:12]** It's such a clever name.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** The, like, circus area.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:16]** I'd have to look it up.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:23]** Anyways, so you guys make it back to Kefak Depot, you make it back into town, and you kind of come around that corner where Jugger's Delight is.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:27]** There's a... You've got a line of true warriors there.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:31]** And you see Riddle on the phone.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:40]** That they're actually calling... They're calling their cousin and saying, Hey, man, I got this big thing for you.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:45]** I don't know how to handle it, but it's... Probably get you a big promotion if you guys...

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** Come pick these ones up.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:48]** I'm thinking you should be the lead on this.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:53]** And, you know, she hangs up and she's got them pinned against the wall.

**[01:12:54 - 01:13:00]** Everybody in town is kind of watching kind of awkwardly because there's goblins and Keshtis in town.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** But they're not being rowdy and ridiculous.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:06]** They're almost like orderly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:10]** Cats and dogs living together harmoniously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:12]** And the town knows the true warriors at this point.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** They recognize them.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:16]** That's what all those red blotches on the map that I threw up is.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:23]** So these town people see that the goblins are the ones that handled the true warriors.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** So take that what it is.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:27]** What are you four doing?

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** You said you're not staying the Night of the Junkers.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** Are you heading to a bar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:34]** Well, I believe, to me, you said you wanted to get some rest, right?

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:37]** Perhaps you might want to stay at Trunkers or at the...

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:39]** What was that hotel that we stayed at?

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:39]** The hotel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:45]** Listen, I just gotta make sure that you aren't taken off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:48]** Yeah, that is very well said to me.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:52]** And no, everyone needs to keep a close eye on Rolu for the night.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:53]** You're sneaky, Rolu.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:56]** We gotta keep an eye on you, alright?

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:58]** So everyone, I think, should rotate watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:01]** I've been feeling pretty lucky.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:04]** We should probably hit up and maybe even stay at the casino tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:07]** I hear they got a nice buffet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:11]** Get some kefaktel, some broiled kefaktel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** That does sound good.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:19]** You did order a lot of those for the table there, Thaddeus, at some point.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:24]** So, you know, we all knew it was just you eating it for the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:31]** Somehow implying that Thaddeus is selfish.


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:32]** Well,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]** Alright, so to the casino.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:36]** John wins.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:40]** I don't know what game we were playing.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:44]** John just won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:45]** You might like a plate.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:46]** I'll share in a plate.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:48]** Will you have that, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:49]** Let's go.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:49]** Let's go.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** Let's go.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:59]** So, like, as we're walking over, Chuck hops to Thaddeus' shoulder and, like, shoves him in the, I guess, neck.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** What's up, bud?

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:03]** To, like, sorry, Termadon's, Termadon's shoulder.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:04]** Not Thaddeus' shoulder.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** Termadon's shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:06]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** What's up, Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** Can we do that mind link thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:10]** Mind link?

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** Mind link?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** Hey, mind link me.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:14]** Mind link me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:36]** sure sure sure i just get some rest first or no i sent you a text check your phone what do you want to talk about you don't have your communicator shock so it makes sense that you're like hey can you mind like you threw it i did i yeeted that yeah um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:43]** Hey, Jermaine, we're, uh, just so you know, I think come tomorrow morning, you're not going to find me or Rolu.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:45]** Are you in or are you out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:47]** Well, what is it?

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** What's your plan anyhow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:52]** Oh, time out.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:53]** John, what's that organ?

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:54]** Is it the veil?

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:56]** Is it the veil of this year?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:03]** We're taking this stone to the Veil of the Seer to try to prevent the decimation of the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:07]** Okay, could I roll a culture check to see if I know anything about the Veil of the Seer?

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:12]** Because this is the first time I think I'm hearing this word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** No, it's not.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:17]** Rolo said it, but did you say it within earshot of Tremay, though?

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:20]** Oh, because it was what you guys were asking him in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:23]** He said, look, the stone is for the... You've heard it before.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** You've definitely heard it before.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:25]** Roll a culture check.

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:26]** You, player, don't look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:29]** Roll a culture check.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:32]** So I rolled a... 23.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:34]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:35]** I think that's enough to know something, John.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:36]** Give us something.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:38]** Because I don't know anything.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:39]** Can I roll my own culture check on this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:43]** Well, I'm just going to tell you the same thing that you knew before, which is about all that you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:44]** Right.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:48]** So if I might, because I think you technically rolled it against me.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:58]** The Veil of Assyria is basically a legit fortune teller, but would be invested in reading...

**[01:16:58 - 01:17:01]** Not necessarily at the micro scale, but the macro scale.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:09]** So they would see individual lives that are nexus points, but are trying to read the future of society as a whole.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:10]** Go ahead, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:23]** And I just might add that they are the external PR arm of Nekral, who is the entity that is the clairvoyant one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:37]** So that I guess what the culture check might impress upon you, and this is open to your interpretation, is that what is happening is of importance to society as a whole in the fact worlds, right?

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:47]** But that Rolu's path in this future is going to create a nexus point for the rest of society as we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:48]** Wow.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:49]** Well then.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:51]** Would I...

**[01:17:53 - 01:18:04]** see or view this as antithetical to the Free Captains or in greater... I think in context of the Free Captains, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:14]** This is not in line with what the Free Captains... Well, like, I'm effectively inviting you to commit treason against the Free Captains to save Rolu's life and the life of this universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** But, okay, is that your opinion?

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:20]** Or is that, like, just... Yeah, no, that's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:22]** It's just your opinion, dude.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** Like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:38]** Would I respect enough of what I know about Nacral and like, would I see this as sort of like an apostate belief or would I see this as genuine?

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:40]** Like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** You got to dive into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:43]** That's a question.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:46]** If I might, if I might clarify the question.

**[01:18:46 - 01:19:10]** is this a like a creation myth or is this a proven like they have a long track record yeah they're like they're actual gods they have a long track record of accurately predicting the future they are not gods you just know that necrol accurately has predicted like the invasion of the swarm the stardust plague


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:13]** They've predicted a lot of stuff, and they've been right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:15]** So, like, it's not creation myth.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:18]** It's actual things that have happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:23]** For instance, they will often say, like, hey, Starfinders.

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:25]** Are they neutral, or are they, like, evil?

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:27]** I... There's...

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:28]** What do I know?

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:33]** They're an entity that the Starfinders will be like, hey, we found this thing.

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:38]** And then the Vale will be like, it is important that we have that for this.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:40]** And again, they have a track record.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:43]** So it's a, it's a question for Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:46]** Like they're, when they make a claim, they make a claim.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:59]** The question you, if you're doubtful, the question you should be asking is like, is shock like telling the truth, but more accurately is Rolu telling the truth and then passing it down to shock and then you getting it.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:04]** So like you might trust the veil, but do you trust Rolu and, and shock for that matter?


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:05]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:07]** He might be f***ing lying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:12]** I really believe in Thaddeus and Kelly's campaign against Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:14]** Smear campaign.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:16]** It's a super reasonable thing.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:20]** You're going to give up your entire life, your entire job that you take immense pride in.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:23]** To save the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:27]** As someone who was in the military and the Navy... For something that Rolu passed along.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:33]** I'm just going to say, people who argue that the Navy is life versus a job is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:35]** That's a big thing.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:36]** Just saying.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:36]** Just saying.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:37]** But it's a job.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:38]** It's a job.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:42]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:42]** That might hurt some feelings.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:43]** I'm sorry.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** That was my opinion.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:45]** What is your opinion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:48]** Paperclips or not paperclips or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:50]** I have a paperclip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:51]** Anyway.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:55]** So what is your opinion on the military code?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:56]** That's another.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:57]** We're getting away from it.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:58]** Torme, what are you doing?

**[01:20:58 - 01:20:59]** Yes or no, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:02]** Are you in or out?

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:07]** I want to know more about this Vale you speak of.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:13]** I've heard of their predictions, but I do not wish to betray my crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:16]** This is definitely like a red pill, blue pill thing.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:19]** Like you either jump in fully or don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:22]** Now you're romanticizing the blue perspective right now.

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:25]** So I'm not going to like, yeah.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:26]** This is not compared to the matrix.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** Let's be more practical here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:31]** I think it's absolutely a red pill, blue pill moment.

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:34]** You get a shit or get off the pot, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:55]** that's it you gotta get off the pot but like do you trust also this is definitely a moment deserving of some johnny walker blue yeah absolutely well i'm all out i ran dry of all my beers i am on the last of my lefroy 10 you're you're pouring blue but you want to take the red label


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:21:55 - 01:22:00]** Blue label is more delicious.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:02]** Kelly would appreciate this one.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:05]** This is the Tiger special edition.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:06]** I love it.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:07]** The Tiger special edition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:10]** That's cool.

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:15]** In that case, they are pouring blue label.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:16]** Yeah, this is at the bar.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:17]** Over at the Vale.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:18]** This is at the bar.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:19]** He gets a share of drinks.

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:23]** Chuck's just like casually, hey man, you coming or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:26]** This is the VIP table and everything.

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:27]** It's all the things I want.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:35]** It's actually even more awkward than that because we're just like making faces at each other, sipping stupid expensive scotch.

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:37]** At a loud casino.

**[01:22:37 - 01:22:38]** At a loud casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:41]** Yeah, this is happening as we're walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** This is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:43]** Okay, I'm in.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:51]** I think Rolu and Thaddeus are both eating some of the broiled kefat.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:52]** Let's f***ing go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:55]** For the listener, I'm shocked.

**[01:22:55 - 01:22:56]** I have no idea where this is going.

**[01:22:57 - 01:22:58]** Like, what?

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:05]** So now, just to reiterate, we have Rolu, Chak, and Treme.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:11]** The three of you have now decided to step away from the Caduceus, which is in...

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:12]** The free captain's tenant.

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:17]** It says if you were on shore, you could leave at any time you want without any punishment.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:19]** If you were on the ship, it's different.

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]** But you're not on the ship.

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:28]** So the three of you are choosing to depart from the Caduceus and follow this path that Rolu has laid out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:32]** And we haven't derelicted... I haven't derelicted my duties at all.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:34]** I've completed my mission.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:38]** I'm free to explore where this may lead.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:41]** To another extra galactic adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:45]** Frolu, at some point, walks over to Chalk getting a drink.

**[01:23:45 - 01:23:46]** Chalk, are you ready to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:23:47 - 01:23:48]** Yeah, I've got a plan.

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:51]** Just sit tight.

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:52]** I'll get you out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:55]** Well, I've got a plan, too, but, oh, okay.

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:58]** Don't forget I have those spell gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:01]** Okay.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:03]** Oh, yeah, no, I did forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:06]** Yeah, no, yeah, don't forget, yeah.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:08]** I can phase us through a door or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:10]** Oh, how many of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:11]** Oh, hey, Terme.

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:13]** Hey, Terme, how's it going?

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:14]** Are you enjoying your drink?

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:16]** Did you tell him what we talked about?

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:17]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:20]** Yeah, I don't know if you do.

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:21]** They have blue here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:22]** Mind link, mind link.

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:25]** Oh, hey, Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:32]** I just looks over and sees them all just like staring at each other without saying anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:34]** Rolu is not mind linking.

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:39]** Rolu is like, Rolu doesn't know that Torme is in.

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:41]** So Rolu is like, hey, it's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:42]** No, for sure.

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:43]** Yeah.

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:44]** Just drinking.

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:45]** All right there, man.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:49]** It seems like you're PTSD from the last adventure or something.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:51]** awfully quiet, all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:58]** I'm just very, very tired from getting wrecked by a freaking Shabbat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:04]** And then at some point, Velo's like, Shock, we can't.

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:05]** You have to be more careful.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:08]** We can't let Tomei know.

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:09]** That was very risky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:12]** Are you whispering this to me?

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:15]** Yeah, because you're eating hard-boiled kevac.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:17]** You're going to have to make rolls if you're doing this.

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:18]** You realize, right?

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** Be careful what you say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:19 - 01:25:21]** Have you been to a casino before?

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:22]** Do you know how loud it is in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:27]** This is still an assumption that it still would require rolling, so just be mindful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:28]** I...

**[01:25:28 - 01:25:31]** I will let Kev decide as his final GM victory lap.

**[01:25:32 - 01:25:34]** This is all theater of the mind for all of our listeners.

**[01:25:34 - 01:25:35]** We're all just going.

**[01:25:36 - 01:25:44]** So, Kev, you weigh in and say, you know, unless you say, oh, I'm going to talk to somebody by themselves, then you need to make a check or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:51]** I'm going to say, Thaddeus, you interject at whatever point you think you need to.

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:56]** And at that point, you will roll a perception check on whether or not you heard the last sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:56 - 01:26:00]** So what I think Chuck really wants to do is to pull Thaddeus aside.

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:02]** Stab him in the throat.

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:08]** And just slice him in half with his pincered outfit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:09]** Shoot him in the heart with a crossbow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:18]** Pull him aside to the... Because if I'm in a loud area, we'll get ear fatigue and have to step outside for a minute.

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:22]** So Jack is going to grab Thaddeus and say, Hey, let's step outside for a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:24]** I need a break from all this noise.

**[01:26:25 - 01:26:26]** Can you come with me?

**[01:26:27 - 01:26:29]** We'll have a smoke-a-fuck-dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:43]** Thaddeus takes, like, you know, the stick of, like, whatever, like, shish kebab-like thing he's eating with kefak on it, and just, like, you know, takes all the meat off of it into his mouth, swallows, looks at Rulu suspiciously, and follows Shaq out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:26:44 - 01:26:47]** Rulu just bought Treme a drink.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:50]** But Rulu still doesn't know, I think, that Treme's in.

**[01:26:50 - 01:26:51]** So I'm just gonna put that out there.

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:51]** What's up, man?

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:52]** See ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:26:54 - 01:27:00]** Oh, and I just, sorry, I just want to reiterate, Choc still has this puck in his crotch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:27:00 - 01:27:00]** Yeah.

**[01:27:01 - 01:27:04]** Yep, still this very obvious bulge.

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:07]** That's the sound of a bulge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:13]** He's just, like, walking around like a Lothal from Final Fantasy XIV, which probably no one here knows about, I don't know.

**[01:27:13 - 01:27:18]** And then, like, you know, everyone just, like, watching him, like, wobble out with this huge bulge out of the casino.

**[01:27:18 - 01:27:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:50]** all right what's up buddy so check is going to use every bit of his envoy charm uh-huh this is thaddeus i gotta tell you man you're giving rolu a real hard time look check he was involved in the heist on that ship of a very important free captain he is a traitor period


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:27:51 - 01:27:52]** evidence.

**[01:27:53 - 01:27:59]** How could I not do my duty and not be suspicious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:27:59 - 01:28:01]** Let me ask you a question, Thaddeus.

**[01:28:02 - 01:28:05]** Just, you know, free captain to free captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:28:05 - 01:28:06]** Well, no.

**[01:28:06 - 01:28:11]** What's the term for people who serve under the free captains?

**[01:28:11 - 01:28:12]** Because we are not free captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:14]** I don't know if we established that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:28:15 - 01:28:16]** Shipmate to shipmate.

**[01:28:17 - 01:28:18]** As members of the free captains.

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:19]** Thank you, thank you, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:28:20 - 01:28:25]** Crewmate to crewmate.

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:25]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:28]** Thaddeus, Rolu had his reasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:28:29 - 01:28:30]** And what were they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:28:32 - 01:28:34]** I'm going to speak in a hypothetical here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:28:35 - 01:28:35]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:28:35 - 01:28:36]** Maybe this will help you.

**[01:28:38 - 01:28:49]** If someone had to do something that was against the free captains to save the rest of the universe, would you support it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:28:57 - 01:29:05]** If I was sure that that was the only way to save the universe, or by not doing it, the universe would... Yeah.

**[01:29:06 - 01:29:06]** If I was certain.

**[01:29:07 - 01:29:17]** The problem is, is he's... If that's what you're saying he's doing, if that's why he did that, like raided another vessel, I don't see how it's related.

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:21]** I just can't trust him, Shock.

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:24]** He's not trustworthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:25 - 01:29:26]** What proof do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:29:27 - 01:29:29]** It would take so much more.

**[01:29:29 - 01:29:35]** What we would probably do is take him back to the ship and lock him up in the brig, and then he can explain it then.

**[01:29:35 - 01:29:36]** That's what I would do.

**[01:29:36 - 01:29:38]** There would be plenty of time to figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:45]** If you were to hear from the Vale how important this is, would you believe it then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:29:46 - 01:29:47]** Directly from the Vale?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:49 - 01:29:50]** I said what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:29:54 - 01:29:56]** I would listen to what the Vale has to say.

**[01:29:56 - 01:29:57]** That's all I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:58 - 01:29:59]** That's all I ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:30:00 - 01:30:02]** Am I going to listen to them right now?

**[01:30:02 - 01:30:07]** You somehow have a direct contact to the Veil that you're going to channel to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:07 - 01:30:08]** Just let me call them.

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:12]** Thaddeus, come with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:30:15 - 01:30:17]** I'm going to roll a sense mode of check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:17 - 01:30:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:30:18 - 01:30:18]** Roll it up.

**[01:30:21 - 01:30:23]** It's just a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:30:24 - 01:30:29]** I was going to say don't even roll it because Chak isn't hiding anything.

**[01:30:30 - 01:30:32]** Chak is sincere as the day is long.

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:41]** There is an existential threat that is somehow resolved by taking this stone to the Vale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:48]** Could you elaborate on that?

**[01:30:48 - 01:30:50]** You mean by taking it there...

**[01:30:52 - 01:30:53]** it's going to be like a problem.

**[01:30:53 - 01:30:54]** Like it's not going to take it there.

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:57]** That's how I've heard it, but I don't think it's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:30:57 - 01:30:57]** So right.

**[01:30:58 - 01:31:04]** Jack's impression is that not taking the stone there is going to result in a cataclysmic event.

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:05]** But I see John raising his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:31:08 - 01:31:11]** Just available to elaborate if needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:31:12 - 01:31:13]** Available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:13 - 01:31:35]** a veil yes termaine and rolu are having drinks and having a our conversation during this time and uh termaine just on the mind link goes talks to rollers like so when we leave it for the veil what sorry rolu out loud sorry uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:31:36 - 01:31:39]** Hey, we can talk like this, you know.

**[01:31:41 - 01:31:43]** Brolu said it out loud, like dropped his drink.

**[01:31:43 - 01:31:45]** Sorry, sorry, I'll clean it up.

**[01:31:46 - 01:31:46]** It's fine.

**[01:31:47 - 01:31:51]** And then in his head he's like, what are you talking?

**[01:31:51 - 01:31:54]** I have no idea what you're talking about.

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:55]** Choc gave me the skinny.

**[01:31:57 - 01:31:59]** Choc, Choc, Choc, Choc, Choc, Choc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:00 - 01:32:04]** Choc never told me that he... Unless you don't want me a part of your plans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:32:04 - 01:32:07]** It's not my plans that we're dealing with here.

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:09]** We're dealing with the Vale's plans.

**[01:32:09 - 01:32:13]** If you are... I'm just going to stop you right there.

**[01:32:13 - 01:32:20]** You are telling me that you don't want to take me in as Thaddeus is so opposed diametrically to me.

**[01:32:20 - 01:32:27]** And you don't want to take me into the bridge and you want to leave with me with the employers that I mentioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:28 - 01:32:35]** Listen, I'm not sure if I'm going to go all the way with you, but I'm willing to hear you out and see this through.

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:43]** So if we can cut back to outside with Thaddeus and Rolu.

**[01:32:44 - 01:32:46]** Thaddeus and Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:32:47 - 01:32:49]** I'm not going anywhere with you, though, Shaq.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:51]** I'm staying right here.

**[01:32:51 - 01:32:55]** If the Vale is going to talk to me, they can come here to talk to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:32:56 - 01:33:22]** i don't want to leave worlder by himself for too long you know fair enough i don't have a contact with the veil you were gonna take me to them i was just speaking in hypothetical i think at this point check can i can i roll a sense motive just to like see if there is a path to getting thaddeus on our side that is your thoughts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:33:24 - 01:33:29]** You could roll a sense motive, I guess, if you want to know his motivations for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:33:32 - 01:33:33]** I think Chuck knows nothing.

**[01:33:33 - 01:33:34]** He gets a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:33:37 - 01:33:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:33:41 - 01:33:46]** You know that Thaddeus is... I get the impression that Thaddeus is a stickler for the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:48]** It's...

**[01:33:52 - 01:34:15]** that i can't say too much really but like i'll just say like yeah thaddeus like has many reasons for sticking to what he's doing right now and like and for him to deviate from that it would have to be so like he would have to talk to the veil directly and hear it from them himself and then he would have to think about it yeah okay that's fair


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:34:17 - 01:34:21]** Thaddeus, the best that I can do is to point out two things.

**[01:34:22 - 01:34:28]** One, according to the free captain's code, we are on land and can leave the ship freely.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:33]** And two, if we want to talk to the Vale, we've got to go to Berthita.

**[01:34:36 - 01:34:43]** If you're willing to take this first step with me, I guarantee that once we get there, what you hear will be plenty enough to convince you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:34:48 - 01:34:53]** Man, look, Shaq, I really like you.

**[01:34:53 - 01:35:02]** And I'm guessing the way that you're putting it, it sort of sounds like maybe Treme, you've already convinced him to, like, go with you.

**[01:35:02 - 01:35:02]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:35:04 - 01:35:05]** This isn't about Treme.

**[01:35:05 - 01:35:06]** This is about you and me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:35:06 - 01:35:09]** Yeah, so maybe you convinced Treme to go with you, and...

**[01:35:12 - 01:35:13]** I care about you.

**[01:35:13 - 01:35:18]** I just, I just can't do it, man.

**[01:35:18 - 01:35:20]** I really wish that I could.

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:21]** I want to.

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:23]** But I just can't.

**[01:35:27 - 01:35:29]** I think you're being deceived.

**[01:35:31 - 01:35:37]** And if you go that way, I can't guarantee that

**[01:35:38 - 01:35:42]** If you want to get away, that's your prerogative, but I can't let Rollu get away.

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:54]** But if you help Rollu escape, I won't hesitate to do whatever I can to prevent that from happening.

**[01:35:56 - 01:35:57]** Even if that means you get in the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:36:00 - 01:36:00]** All right.

**[01:36:00 - 01:36:01]** Check looks up at Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:04]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:36:05 - 01:36:33]** I'm sorry man but whatever you do and he reaches out a paw he's like know that I always wish you the best he extends a pawed leaf hand this to the captain for me and he hands him a folded up sheet of paper a tear rolls out of Chuck's eye as he shakes Thaddeus' hand it's been a pleasure serving with you likewise likewise man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:36:34 - 01:36:36]** And they both go back into the casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:47]** Okay, so you guys all... You make your way back through the crowds because there's people at the... What are they called?

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:48]** The slot machines?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:49]** Tables?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:52]** Yeah, there's crap tables, whatever the equivalent of crap tables are.

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:53]** Slot machines!

**[01:36:53 - 01:36:56]** People along slot machines, there's pits, all that fun stuff.

**[01:36:56 - 01:36:58]** You make your way back to that little bar in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:36:58 - 01:37:01]** Chuck's singular mission is making eye contact with Tremada.

**[01:37:02 - 01:37:03]** Like, it's go time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:37:03 - 01:37:04]** Yeah.

**[01:37:03 - 01:37:16]** Thaddeus is just like, he takes a position not quite next to Rolu, but sort of like now kind of like not quite opposite of them, but to like the right so that you can see all three of them.

**[01:37:16 - 01:37:17]** He just studies them carefully.

**[01:37:18 - 01:37:21]** And he gets his comm ready to call the Caduceus.

**[01:37:24 - 01:37:24]** Okay.

**[01:37:24 - 01:37:25]** If needs be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:37:26 - 01:37:30]** So we're all standing there at... Is this a Mexican standoff?

**[01:37:31 - 01:37:31]** Yes, it is.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:35]** So, like, I'm looking for Termade, and do I need to make a roll to find him?

**[01:37:35 - 01:37:38]** Or is it just, like, I find you guys at the bar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:37:39 - 01:37:40]** I think you find him at the bar.

**[01:37:40 - 01:37:48]** Like, the four of you are now at the bar, but it's... It's, like, Termade and Rollu are standing right next to each other, because they were talking.

**[01:37:49 - 01:37:55]** But then, Chuck, you roll up, and Thaddeus is just behind you, and there's a clear gap between you and Thaddeus.

**[01:37:55 - 01:37:55]** Like...

**[01:37:57 - 01:38:00]** It's like a breakup, and it's sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:38:00 - 01:38:05]** Thaddeus, while this is happening, sends off a message to the Kadushas.

**[01:38:05 - 01:38:09]** It is requesting immediate backup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:38:10 - 01:38:16]** Chak does his best to disappear into the crowd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:38:16 - 01:38:17]** You're making a run for it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:38:17 - 01:38:23]** I am disappearing into the crowd so that I can make a distraction for Rolu and Termay to get away.

**[01:38:24 - 01:38:32]** Before I do that, because I want to find Termay, make eye contact, I want to somehow motion to him to create a mind link with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:38:33 - 01:38:36]** Tap your temples with your extra vines.

**[01:38:36 - 01:38:38]** Yes, Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:40]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:38:40 - 01:38:42]** Thaddeus is a no-go.

**[01:38:43 - 01:38:44]** I'm going to create a distraction.

**[01:38:45 - 01:38:48]** You get Rolu out of here.


## Speaker_0

**[01:38:48 - 01:38:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:48 - 01:38:50]** Let's see this distraction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:38:50 - 01:38:55]** Meet me 15 clicks outside of Junkers Delight at the junkyards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:38:57 - 01:38:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:38:58 - 01:38:59]** We'll secure transport from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:39:00 - 01:39:05]** Thaddeus takes his hornium venom caster into his left hand and readies a shot.

**[01:39:05 - 01:39:06]** In the casino?

**[01:39:07 - 01:39:07]** Underneath the table.

**[01:39:08 - 01:39:08]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:08 - 01:39:09]** It's on Kapok Depot.

**[01:39:09 - 01:39:10]** I think that's okay.

**[01:39:11 - 01:39:12]** I'm not going to allow it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:39:12 - 01:39:14]** This is like the tattooing of his world.

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:15]** And he just keeps looking.

**[01:39:16 - 01:39:19]** Well, you think we should head back to our rooms?

**[01:39:20 - 01:39:22]** He looks like dead into their eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:23 - 01:39:27]** As you do that, you're raising your formian caster and people around are starting to notice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:39:28 - 01:39:28]** It's under the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:29 - 01:39:30]** It's a big gun.

**[01:39:30 - 01:39:35]** There's at least a couple of people that see that happen and they start to step away.

**[01:39:35 - 01:39:37]** They turn and go ahead.

**[01:39:37 - 01:39:38]** Give me a perception check, Rolo.

**[01:39:41 - 01:40:09]** 10 you got a total of 10 oh that was your bonus you don't even notice you were you were focused on termay and you're just like having a good time and and but like the camera is like looking we got termay right in the foreground but blurry rolu is focused on rolu and then it's gonna it's gonna just tighten in as as thaddeus in the back starts to raise up his gun and people start to back away even the bartender kind of like backs up and starts to like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:40:10 - 01:40:13]** So, TremÃ©, we need to find out a plan.

**[01:40:13 - 01:40:15]** When Shock gets back, we need to find out a plan to get out of here.

**[01:40:15 - 01:40:18]** I guess Shock was talking to Thaddeus, but we need to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:19 - 01:40:20]** Yeah, he said to meet outside.

**[01:40:21 - 01:40:23]** Junkers, 15 clicks from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:40:24 - 01:40:24]** All right.

**[01:40:24 - 01:40:25]** I have my spell gem.

**[01:40:26 - 01:40:29]** We can phase out of the wall if we need to, or into another location.

**[01:40:30 - 01:40:34]** Or lock Thaddeus somewhere, I guess, if Thaddeus doesn't comply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:40:34 - 01:40:34]** Okay.

**[01:40:34 - 01:40:42]** Since I'm watching Thaddeus after our conversation, do I need to make a perception check to see him pull his... I think you just see it happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:40:42 - 01:40:43]** So I would see it happening as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:40:44 - 01:40:47]** I don't think Tormeia... Tormeia, you'd have to roll perception.

**[01:40:47 - 01:40:47]** 17.

**[01:40:47 - 01:40:59]** So you would see the people moving, I think, but you wouldn't necessarily see... There's enough between you that you wouldn't see the gun coming up, but there's enough for you to recognize that Thaddeus is up to something.

**[01:40:59 - 01:41:02]** And so slow-mo, he's drawn his gun up.

**[01:41:02 - 01:41:03]** He's pointing it at Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:41:04 - 01:41:08]** And I'm going to say to Thaddeus in the mind link, don't do this, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:41:09 - 01:41:11]** To me, are you going to leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:11 - 01:41:13]** I'm free to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:41:13 - 01:41:16]** Are you going to leave with Rulu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:41:21 - 01:41:27]** In that pause, Chak trips the waiter heading to Thaddeus' table.


## Speaker_0

**[01:41:27 - 01:41:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:41:29 - 01:41:47]** it's just it's just the like the next passing waiter just full plate go ahead give me a reflex save kelly okay all right here comes 21

**[01:41:49 - 01:41:57]** He sees it coming, and he's raising his gun up, and he sees you trip him, and at that point, he just takes a step back.

**[01:41:57 - 01:42:05]** The waiter smacks his face right into the side of the counter, and Thaddeus has his gun fully raised and pointed right at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:42:05 - 01:42:06]** Rolu runs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:07 - 01:42:11]** And TremÃ© is going to follow.

**[01:42:12 - 01:42:16]** And I don't know if I... As soon as I see the gun...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:42:17 - 01:42:40]** pointed at rolu i want to cast misfire thaddeus's i'm sorry about this thaddeus's scowl just like takes over his face and in slow motion you see his eyes narrow as he pulls the trigger


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:42:40 - 01:42:43]** So is that an attack roll?

**[01:42:44 - 01:42:45]** I think we need a roll for initiative here.

**[01:42:45 - 01:42:47]** I think we need to... Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:42:49 - 01:42:51]** PVP!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:51 - 01:42:54]** The attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:42:54 - 01:42:55]** What is misfire?

**[01:42:55 - 01:42:57]** Is it a will save or an attack roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:58 - 01:43:02]** It is a DC 13 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:43:03 - 01:43:04]** Reflex.

**[01:43:04 - 01:43:05]** Kelly, roll another reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:05 - 01:43:06]** Wait, no, no, not reflex.

**[01:43:06 - 01:43:07]** Hold on.

**[01:43:07 - 01:43:08]** I picked the wrong one.

**[01:43:08 - 01:43:08]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:43:08 - 01:43:09]** Will save negates.

**[01:43:10 - 01:43:11]** Okay.

**[01:43:11 - 01:43:12]** So it's a DC 13 will save.

**[01:43:13 - 01:43:15]** Kelly, roll me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:43:15 - 01:43:15]** Will save!

**[01:43:21 - 01:43:22]** What did you roll?

**[01:43:22 - 01:43:24]** What did you roll, Kelly Gilliam?

**[01:43:24 - 01:43:25]** It's a five.

**[01:43:26 - 01:43:30]** The shock careens off of a vodka tonic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:43:30 - 01:43:32]** No, it doesn't fire at all.

**[01:43:32 - 01:43:39]** You raise your rifle, and you actually go to pull that trigger, but it just goes clunk against the back of the gun, and it doesn't fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:43:39 - 01:43:42]** I love the imagery, because you've got Rolu in your sights.

**[01:43:44 - 01:43:45]** Dead to kill.

**[01:43:45 - 01:43:51]** This is on the nape of his neck, and you pull the trigger, and it goes thunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:43:52 - 01:43:53]** He starts, like, hitting the gun.

**[01:43:54 - 01:43:57]** Trying to, like, dislodge, like the dart.

**[01:43:57 - 01:43:58]** Jack is running away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:43:58 - 01:44:01]** And so the three of you are running.

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:08]** And as soon, I feel like when you look back to see Rolo, he turns and stops and looks at you, and you can just see the corner of his eyes as he smiles.

**[01:44:08 - 01:44:09]** F*** off, Rolo.

**[01:44:09 - 01:44:10]** Okay.

**[01:44:11 - 01:44:13]** All right, Kev, what are we doing?

**[01:44:13 - 01:44:14]** Are we in initiative?

**[01:44:14 - 01:44:15]** How are we doing this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:44:15 - 01:44:16]** I don't even think so.

**[01:44:16 - 01:44:18]** I think that... What is your guys' run speed?

**[01:44:19 - 01:44:20]** Yeah, we don't need... 30 feet.

**[01:44:21 - 01:44:21]** You each have 30 feet?

**[01:44:23 - 01:44:24]** Thaddeus is still wearing that heavy armor.

**[01:44:24 - 01:44:26]** There's no way he's going to catch you.

**[01:44:26 - 01:44:28]** Thaddeus is like, you just wait, Roldu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:44:28 - 01:44:29]** You're not going anywhere.

**[01:44:29 - 01:44:33]** And he pulls out his dash go and starts dashing as quickly as he can.

**[01:44:33 - 01:44:34]** Okay.

**[01:44:34 - 01:44:36]** But not quite being able to keep up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:44:36 - 01:44:43]** Yeah, I think Treme and Rolu run and then run towards a dead end.

**[01:44:44 - 01:44:46]** And Rolu's like, Treme, just hold on.

**[01:44:46 - 01:44:49]** And one hand pulls out the spell gem of Planar Phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:44:50 - 01:44:53]** Before we get to the dead end, you see Chek hop onto Rolu's shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:44:58 - 01:45:05]** And we're just running, and there's a light, and I just picture Thaddeus running and turning the corner because he saw us go around the corner.

**[01:45:05 - 01:45:08]** Just like light, just a round flash of light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:45:08 - 01:45:12]** Rollo just squeezes the gem in his hand as Choc jumps on his shoulder.

**[01:45:12 - 01:45:15]** The two of you jump through that portal.

**[01:45:15 - 01:45:17]** And appear on the other side of the wall.

**[01:45:17 - 01:45:17]** The three of you.

**[01:45:17 - 01:45:18]** Right.

**[01:45:18 - 01:45:18]** The three of you.

**[01:45:19 - 01:45:21]** Well, I meant the two of you and then Chakana's shoulder.

**[01:45:21 - 01:45:21]** Yeah.

**[01:45:21 - 01:45:22]** Anyways.

**[01:45:22 - 01:45:25]** So he grabs the gem, squeezes it tight.

**[01:45:25 - 01:45:26]** You guys are through the wall.

**[01:45:26 - 01:45:30]** Right as Thaddeus comes slidding up, slidding around that corner with his gun drawn.

**[01:45:31 - 01:45:32]** And it's just, there's nobody there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:45:33 - 01:45:35]** There's Dashko in his hand.

**[01:45:35 - 01:45:36]** Damn it.

**[01:45:38 - 01:45:39]** Some magic, I'm sure.

**[01:45:40 - 01:45:45]** He like looks for the entrance and where he was previously with shock and starts dashing towards it.

**[01:45:46 - 01:45:49]** Goes outside into the sand, looking frantically in every direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:45:50 - 01:45:50]** Where are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:45:51 - 01:45:52]** Where are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:45:52 - 01:45:53]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:45:54 - 01:45:56]** Just like people running around you trying to leave.

**[01:45:56 - 01:45:57]** Oh my God.

**[01:45:57 - 01:45:57]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:45:58 - 01:46:07]** With a 24, you make it outside just in time to see them sprinting off into the darkness.

**[01:46:07 - 01:46:07]** Yes.

**[01:46:10 - 01:46:15]** And so you know the direction they're going, but you know you will never catch them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:46:17 - 01:46:18]** I will find you!

**[01:46:18 - 01:46:22]** I will get you and you will pay for what you have done!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:46:29 - 01:46:33]** Thaddeus takes a moment to try to catch his breath.

**[01:46:38 - 01:46:39]** And then he takes out his comm unit.

**[01:46:42 - 01:46:43]** And he rings.

**[01:46:46 - 01:46:46]** He dials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:46:51 - 01:46:55]** And after a few seconds, a shadowy figure appears.

**[01:46:56 - 01:47:00]** It's a holographic form lighting Thaddeus' face in the darkness.

**[01:47:01 - 01:47:06]** The image is a human male in a three-piece suit.

**[01:47:07 - 01:47:13]** And on his lapel is a pin of a skull with two cross swords and a circle around it.

**[01:47:14 - 01:47:15]** It's the symbol of the Free Captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:47:17 - 01:47:18]** Ah, Thaddeus.

**[01:47:19 - 01:47:20]** Do you have an update for me?

**[01:47:21 - 01:47:23]** Commodore, you were right.

**[01:47:24 - 01:47:26]** Roldu was involved in the heist on your ship.

**[01:47:27 - 01:47:31]** I also discovered evidence of their first mate Shera Dawnbreaker's collusion.

**[01:47:32 - 01:47:35]** Ah, that confirms my suspicions.

**[01:47:36 - 01:47:39]** I'm glad I placed you on the Caduceus.

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:46]** But my lord Rulu, the rat, he got away.

**[01:47:47 - 01:47:49]** Also, I had to attack him.

**[01:47:49 - 01:47:56]** It wasn't sanctioned and I broke the code, but I promise you it was necessary.

**[01:47:56 - 01:47:58]** I will take care of that, Thaddeus.

**[01:47:59 - 01:48:00]** You'll be fine.

**[01:48:01 - 01:48:03]** But don't chase after Rolu just yet.

**[01:48:04 - 01:48:05]** Stick to Goldhorn.

**[01:48:06 - 01:48:08]** I will see that Rolu is taken care of.

**[01:48:08 - 01:48:11]** There's something else.

**[01:48:11 - 01:48:12]** He took something with him.

**[01:48:12 - 01:48:14]** A puck.

**[01:48:15 - 01:48:16]** It glows blue.

**[01:48:16 - 01:48:18]** There was a grey that wanted it.

**[01:48:19 - 01:48:20]** A grey?

**[01:48:20 - 01:48:25]** Well, this is an interesting development.

**[01:48:25 - 01:48:27]** Make sure you brief Goldhorn on that.

**[01:48:28 - 01:48:31]** That puck will likely have something to do with that meddling insect here.

**[01:48:32 - 01:48:38]** But Thaddeus, for the puck, beyond Goldhorn, try to keep the rest of that information contained.

**[01:48:39 - 01:48:41]** Keep this between us.

**[01:48:41 - 01:48:43]** I don't want the rest of the council to find out.

**[01:48:44 - 01:48:46]** But I can help Commodore.

**[01:48:46 - 01:48:48]** I can find Wooloo and bring him to justice.

**[01:48:50 - 01:48:51]** Not yet, Thaddeus.

**[01:48:51 - 01:48:52]** Not yet.

**[01:48:53 - 01:48:55]** I will let you know if I need you to move.

**[01:48:56 - 01:48:57]** Stay put.

**[01:48:59 - 01:49:00]** Aye, sir.

**[01:49:01 - 01:49:02]** You've done very well.

**[01:49:02 - 01:49:09]** We will get heirs, and when we do, he will beg for the death he has thus far averted.

**[01:49:10 - 01:49:16]** I will rain a vengeance upon the knave's revenge the likes of stars have never seen.

**[01:49:16 - 01:49:40]** And before Thaddeus can reply, the image disappears, and the line goes dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:49:41 - 01:49:48]** And Thaddeus lowers his gun, puts away his dashco, and starts to walk back towards the casino.

**[01:49:49 - 01:49:53]** And as he does, he hears a rumble in the distance.

**[01:49:53 - 01:49:55]** And then, a sharp whine.

**[01:49:57 - 01:50:02]** You, Thaddeus, recognize this to be the sound of a Thastron warp drive charging up.

**[01:50:03 - 01:50:08]** At first, Thaddeus has this look of confusion, because nothing can fly in Confoc Depot.

**[01:50:10 - 01:50:23]** But that confusion shifts to anger and there's a as a vessel shoots into the sky, leaving only a trail of dark purple smoke in the night sky.

**[01:50:25 - 01:50:28]** And now I want to take this in true cinematic style.

**[01:50:28 - 01:50:36]** That ship just pauses and starts to reverse and starts to gobble up that smoke bit by bit as time reverses.

**[01:50:36 - 01:50:39]** And we're going to cut back to Thaddeus.

**[01:50:39 - 01:50:43]** That anger on his face, it's going to rewind into just pure confusion.

**[01:50:45 - 01:50:46]** And then we cut to Rolu.

**[01:50:48 - 01:50:55]** He steps out from behind a wrecked A-Tech frigate, and he scans the area to make sure that he hasn't been followed.

**[01:50:57 - 01:51:02]** Termay and Chak follow him out.

**[01:51:02 - 01:51:03]** What happens next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:51:05 - 01:51:06]** Rolu

**[01:51:07 - 01:51:10]** Says... It's not much further.

**[01:51:15 - 01:51:21]** And you look before you... And you see... The wall of just a remote building.

**[01:51:22 - 01:51:26]** It's like this... The end of... It's the waste of Kefak Depot.

**[01:51:28 - 01:51:29]** And Rollo pulls out a communicator.

**[01:51:32 - 01:51:36]** And just sends a message that says... I'm here...

**[01:51:37 - 01:51:39]** I have two others.

**[01:51:42 - 01:51:44]** And he turns around to Terme.

**[01:51:48 - 01:51:51]** This is not expressly permitted.

**[01:51:52 - 01:51:55]** Just to be clear, I don't know what their reaction will be.

**[01:51:55 - 01:51:58]** We're a bit of a gray area.

**[01:51:59 - 01:52:01]** But thank you both for

**[01:52:03 - 01:52:27]** coming along i it means a lot and i think you made the right choice to move away from some of the players and the free captains who all their motivations what i know is not for the good of the packed worlds let's see what the veil has to say about this

**[01:52:28 - 01:52:28]** Let's see.

**[01:52:29 - 01:52:33]** That's some bold talk, but I'm here for it.

**[01:52:33 - 01:52:36]** I just think that there is something afoot.

**[01:52:37 - 01:52:43]** But we have this, and we are on the right side of history.

**[01:52:43 - 01:52:47]** And then there's a... And there's a message back, and Rolu looks.

**[01:52:48 - 01:52:51]** And Rolu had said, I'm here.

**[01:52:52 - 01:52:52]** I have two others.

**[01:52:53 - 01:52:55]** And the response is, we know.

**[01:52:56 - 01:53:10]** And then there's this and the door of the building opens and then begins to like unfold as if it were an illusory wall.

**[01:53:11 - 01:53:16]** And there's a ship big enough for three people sitting in there.

**[01:53:16 - 01:53:18]** The Thasteron ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:53:18 - 01:53:20]** Last one in is a rotten Rexalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:22 - 01:53:26]** Always a charmer, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:53:27 - 01:53:29]** You all get in.

**[01:53:29 - 01:53:34]** I just need to... I just need to take care of something and let them know.

**[01:53:35 - 01:53:41]** Walks up with you, helps you get in, start to fire up the ship.

**[01:53:42 - 01:53:50]** Rolu is somewhat aware of working a Thastron ship, but Tormain, Shank, have you used one of these before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:51 - 01:53:55]** Oh, yeah, I think I saw one on an auction one time.

**[01:53:56 - 01:53:59]** I almost bought one, but I never piloted one, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:54:00 - 01:54:06]** Yeah, I did some Googling after I got my blaster on how Thastron worked.

**[01:54:06 - 01:54:08]** You know, I've never flown one, but I know how.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:54:09 - 01:54:10]** All right.

**[01:54:11 - 01:54:11]** All right.

**[01:54:12 - 01:54:16]** Well, we three, this new crew, we will figure it out.

**[01:54:17 - 01:54:20]** You need to put in the coordinates to Brithita.

**[01:54:21 - 01:54:23]** while I send a message.

**[01:54:23 - 01:54:23]** Is that all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:54:24 - 01:54:24]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:54:25 - 01:54:25]** I'll punch it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:54:25 - 01:54:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:26 - 01:54:29]** Don't take too long, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:54:30 - 01:54:31]** No, I won't take too long.

**[01:54:31 - 01:54:32]** It's very quick.

**[01:54:32 - 01:54:32]** Sorry, sorry.

**[01:54:33 - 01:54:34]** One sec.

**[01:54:34 - 01:54:34]** R'lu walks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:35 - 01:54:38]** We got three captains about to bear down on us.

**[01:54:38 - 01:54:38]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:54:38 - 01:54:39]** You're right.

**[01:54:39 - 01:54:41]** You're right.

**[01:54:41 - 01:54:42]** Okay.

**[01:54:42 - 01:54:43]** All right.

**[01:54:44 - 01:54:50]** R'lu pulls up the message that he said, I'm ready to sell my paintings.

**[01:54:50 - 01:54:52]** And he sends in all caps.

**[01:54:53 - 01:54:54]** Sell them now.

**[01:54:55 - 01:54:56]** I have others.

**[01:54:59 - 01:55:05]** And then he pulls up a recording, an audio recording.

**[01:55:07 - 01:55:08]** And he

**[01:55:09 - 01:55:25]** Under the night sky of Kefak Tipo, with two crew members who decided to trust in Rolu and the Veil, and they're about to leave and fly away in a no-fly zone, he presses the record button.

**[01:55:28 - 01:55:33]** He says, Sir, you are not going to believe my luck.

**[01:55:34 - 01:55:34]** I...

**[01:55:35 - 01:55:41]** I might have just discovered something that would be of immense use to you.

**[01:55:43 - 01:55:45]** You're not getting these messages.

**[01:55:45 - 01:55:48]** I don't know where this is going.

**[01:55:48 - 01:55:52]** This is going to be the last time that I try and speak with you.

**[01:55:55 - 01:55:58]** It's been too long, and I don't even know where you are.

**[01:55:58 - 01:56:05]** If this finds its way to you, sir, if you hear this,

**[01:56:06 - 01:56:07]** Then you know where to meet me.

**[01:56:12 - 01:56:17]** And then he sends it to here's Fabricius.
