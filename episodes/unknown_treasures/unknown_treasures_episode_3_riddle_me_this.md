## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:02]** And welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** More importantly, welcome back to Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:09]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** Still hoping there's a treasure at the end of this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:13]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** I hope there are like Michael Bay explosions.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:22]** I feel like the way you said that was like just like dozens of explosions in the distance.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:23]** You said that.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** Yes, that's exactly what happened.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** That's how I pictured it.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Thank you.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** I'm going to add it in.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:32]** Before we go any further, my name is Kevin.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** I am your GM.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** And I just want to go around the room real quick.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:43]** And I want everybody to tell me your name, your character in this show, and what your favorite tree is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** And I'll start with the trees.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:51]** My favorite tree I currently fall in love with, a Japanese maple that resides in my backyard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Ooh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:57]** It kind of like canopies over our patio deck thing.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** It's lovely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** That's dope.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Blooms red.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Yeah.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Thanks, Kevin.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** That's what I wanted to choose, but it's fine.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** That sounds nice.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** There's no rules against choosing what you could say is same as Kevin?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** No, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** But then he doesn't want to come across as unoriginal, right?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Yeah.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Yeah.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** So you really forced his hand there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** We'll start with you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** No, I need to Google trees now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** Hold on.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Sorry.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** I'm going to Google just trees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** Trees.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Yep.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** That's fun.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** So I'm Vinny.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** I play Jack the Raxalite.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** He's a lot of fun.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]** And my favorite tree, my favorite like actual tree that I know.

**[00:02:38 - 00:03:07]** is I got three crepe myrtles in the front of my house and they're like super green right now and they're gonna bloom in like a month and I can't wait but I've really like I've been scheming for almost a year where to put a magnolia tree I really want a magnolia tree and they don't grow too big here in Florida but like the big white blooms are just gorgeous to me those stink do they


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** They have quite a smell to them.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** And I will leave that conversation for another time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:19]** Now that Kevin's crushed my dreams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Yeah.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** Yeah.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Man, Kev.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** He's dream crushing already at the beginning.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** He really is.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** He's like, I'm taking your tree.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** My dream's gone.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Your tree literally stinks.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Your tree stinks.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Next.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Next.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** I know why Kevin chose this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:40]** They had them around my neighborhood in LA and they smell like bodily fluids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** I'm going to have to go smell a magnolia tree now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** I think you need to.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** I appreciate magnolia trees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** Or plant it far enough away from the house where I don't actually smell it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** So it falls in your neighbor.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** I was just going to say you should plant it next to your neighbor's window.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** Yeah.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** Yeah.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Well, John, what's your favorite tree?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** My name's John.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:06]** I play Rolu on this show.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** And, you know, it's tough.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** I was going to say birch, kind of a birch guy.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:17]** I don't know if there are any birch fans listening in, but if so, hit me up.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** We can talk about birch.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:22]** And then I realized one thing that I do love that's not even particular to any tree.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** It's just Spanish moss.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:32]** You know, when you're just like driving down the road, there's some trees, there's some Spanish moss hanging down over the road.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** It's just a cool look, man.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** So in that way, I love all trees.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** As long as they can support Spanish moss.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Also, pine trees smell good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** What if they don't support Spanish moss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** That's okay.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It's okay, too.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** Also, like I said, pine trees smell really good.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** I like the smell of pine needles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Spanish moss does look really pretty.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** I'm looking at it right now.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:52]** Right?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Kelly's still investigating what his tree is.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** So let's move on to Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** Oh, man.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:06]** Well, my name's Will, and I play Treme Hermidex in this adventure.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:11]** And I have a, you know, it's hard for me to pick really one favorite tree.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:22]** And also, I mean, I don't know if this is technically a tree, the Yucca Breffalia, commonly known as the Joshua tree.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** You're saying it might be considered a bush or a cactus?

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:25]** Might be.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** It's a succulent.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** So it's a sort of cactus, but yes.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:41]** And of course, you know, being a native Californian, I am partial to the giant sequoia or sequoia dendron giganteum, the giant sequoia.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:50]** But I would say the coolest looking tree that I really like is the that I've never seen in person, but I kind of want to see it.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Is the boabab tree.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Boabab tree?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** And don't see me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** I think you're going to have to put that up on social media so we can all look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** Oh, but I can't put Spanish moss up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** People know what Spanish moss looks like.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** It's like the tree that Rafiki lives in, maybe.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Oh, that's so cool.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Cue the toto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I'm in the rain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:24]** I didn't really care about trees too much until I moved to Maryland, and I now own, what, five trees?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** Yeah, I own five trees now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** How many of you itemized your trees?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** You're in your full suburban dad status, dude.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** You really are, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:45]** My neighbors, we did a little block party over the weekend, and I was talking to one of my neighbors, and he was telling me about his yard, and we walked over, and we were talking about sod, and I was like, man, this is what my life's come to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** And your New Balance sneakers and jorts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** But, but Kelly, did you find one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Transformation complete to dad.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Yeah.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** So I was thinking like what I really, I really like willow trees.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** Those are good, easy choice.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:06]** I feel sometimes if you've ever been under a willow tree, that whole stereotype about there being like lightning bugs under it or fireflies, that's true.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** They do chill out under those.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:12]** Sometimes I've had that experience when I visited the East coast, which is where some of you are.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:18]** But another tree, Will mentioned the sequoia, another really cool one, by the way.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:23]** I don't know, it might be a sequoia or another type of redwood or whatever, but you can actually carve like homes inside of trees.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:32]** And if you go up to Northern California, there's a store carved inside of a big ass redwood that you could, there's like a spiral staircase inside the redwood and windows coming out of it.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** It's really awesome.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** And apparently people in the depression lived in redwoods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:57]** during that period of time i believe it wow it sounds wow fun facts on unknown treasures fun facts that is the treasure is the fun fact no no yeah we want speaking we want real treasure please the treasure speaking of treasures you find along the way no the real rations are the friends you make along the way


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:15]** i know we talked about how we don't want this to be another 90s movie where you find treasure and it's just some prize like that dude i already have the like sentimental acoustic guitar piano riff queued up ready to go for the very end this we are real pirates


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** We're pillaging for friendship.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Come on, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:29]** Speaking of those unknown treasures, those fun facts, let's play a little game of Two Truths and a Lie.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** What?

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Starring Kelly Gilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Oh, no.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** All right.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** You got to cut a little bit of dead air because I had to think about three things.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** So hold on.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Okay.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:46]** A fun tree drama fact while we're waiting.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:52]** So when I bought this place, I was researching crepe myrtles because I've never had any before.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:59]** So naturally, I go to Reddit for my source of information and find myself in r slash trees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** I need to join this apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** R slash trees is all about weed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** Yep.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:14]** And so like the Arbor enthusiasts were like, hey, we really want this sub name.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** And the weed enthusiasts were like, no, we're good.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** We're going to stay here.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:24]** So they started their own subreddit called R slash marijuana enthusiasts.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** That's all about trees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Yes.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** And the marijuana enthusiasts were like, yeah, I'm cool with that.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** It's amazing.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:40]** I guess since Kelly's taking so long, I own a silver maple that apparently grows like a red maple.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** And I have a red maple that it grows like a silver maple.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:48]** Because one's supposed to grow straight up, the other one's supposed to fan out, and mine, for whatever reason, do the opposite.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Interesting.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** And then I have three Japanese maples.

**[00:09:51 - 00:10:00]** The one Japanese maple that's right next to my porch is fairly large for Japanese maple and fans over the deck.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** where there's two other Japanese maples that are much smaller.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** And apparently they're all planted at the same time.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:11]** And so I've learned that Japanese maples actually like some shade.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:21]** So the one next to our deck is underneath the big maple, the big silver maple.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** And so it gets all the shade from that and is prospering because of it.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** That's really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:34]** It's pretty cool to just think about how trees have like, they almost, you know, they they're sentient.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** Oh no, trees are insane.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Yeah, they're awesome.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** It's wild when you go somewhere historic and they're like, this tree has been around for 500 years.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:47]** And it's like, you just think about the day-night cycles that it's seen.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** It's wild.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** It's seen everything, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** The trees in this neighborhood are older than the homes.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** California redwoods.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** The homes were built in 2010, Kev, so they're really old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** They are actually all one organism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Oh, I wouldn't believe that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:09]** No, they've actually done studies where the roots are all intertwined, and if one tree is dying, the other trees will send them nutrients.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** That's so rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Through mycelium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:15]** Yeah, it's the mycelial network.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** It's going to be big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** I'm surprised trees haven't killed us yet.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** It's a long game.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:23]** That's the horror story that I don't want to listen to.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** That's The Happening, right?

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Is that how Spoiler Alert The Happening was?

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** I haven't seen that.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** I haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I think you really did just spoil The Happening for at least three of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:40]** John's going to read the synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** All right, whatever.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** I had to come up with three things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** Sorry.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** Next, he's going to tell us how season four of Stranger Things ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:55]** Dude, I'm just saying the best way, if you don't like to get scared in theaters for jump scares, unless they're good jump scares, and then I do want to get scared.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:00]** But otherwise, it's good to read the synopsis of Horror Stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** How do you qualify a good jump scare from a bad one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** Let me tell you about that the next episode, because I have the perfect moment.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** That's great.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Anyway, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:13]** It's going to be during Two Truths and a Lie when I ask him to... And I'm not even going to play that game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** I'm just going to tell you about the best jumpscare I've ever seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** I read the synopsis instead of watching horror films.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** That's a truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** Because some of them just aren't worth watching because they're bad, but they're still fascinating to read.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** Kelly.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** That's accurate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** All right.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** All right, here we go.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** All right, so...

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** All right, so here we go.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Here's three things.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** I'm allergic to strawberries.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:42]** I've eaten a horse or I'm afraid of clowns.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Clowns?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** I don't think you're allergic to strawberries.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** Are there other clowns?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** I don't know.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** I'm so confused now.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** I just want to clarify I heard the right thing.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** Yeah, clowns.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** It could have been clouds for all I know.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** Puffy white things in the sky scare the crap out of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** I think I happen to know that Kelly hates clowns.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** But I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:28]** but you're not kelly don't let that influence anyone's decision kelly lived in japan and um in the short time that i have been in japan i have eaten horse uh horse horse sushi is actually or sashimi is very good so uh yeah i think you're not only strawberries oh you know what i just realized you gave us three truths i did two lies and a truth


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Oh my god.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** So the truth is that you've eaten the horse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** That's the only truth.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** He loves clowns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** So really, we're playing checkers and Kelly's playing chess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:49]** This was four-dimensional chess so that you can next time believe that I don't know how to play the rules of a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Is it standard chess actually three-dimensional?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** I'm so sorry for this experience.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** I don't know.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** I don't play this game ever.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:22]** yeah i'm the same way man it was good reasoning though i have had horse and it tastes like basically nothing you've had horse kevin how did you like it i have had horse but i liked it like tofu tastes like nothing or like it's the most flavorless meat i've ever had and i felt really bad that a horse had to die to do that it was really weird did you have it cooked or did you have it it was raw i had a cure okay mine we had like a dipping sauce with it and it was delicious

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** Well, you do have to dip it.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** That's what I found out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** The dipping sauce is probably horseradish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** You can dip it and still taste it like nothing.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** Let's get playing.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** Alright, let's play.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Is that enough of a segue?

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Let's play.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** After I said it already?

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Oh, no, it's my job to say that, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I am the GM.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:53]** I did not have horse recipes on my bingo card for today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:59]** That's what you get when you play with Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:04]** Alright, so let me just do a little rundown of what happened last week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Previously on Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Unknown Treasures, Treasures, Treasures.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** So last week, you all confronted these thugs that were beating up on a Yosuke woman in an alleyway.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:26]** While the yeoman chief, Torme, attempted to do a diplomatic resolution, one of the Hilki gang members noticed Rolu settling his hand, one of his forehands, on his gun.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:32]** And that was enough for these three thugs to divert their violence from the Yusuke onto you.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:36]** One thing you did notice before the fight, though, is there was a tattoo on one of their cheeks.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:43]** And you deduced that these guys are part of a street gang from Maro known as the True Warriors.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Now, this fight got out of hand pretty fast.

**[00:15:48 - 00:16:12]** the two hilkies which is a red skin native of um acuton human native of acuton uh they moved up and they cornered all four of you in this little alleyway and lucky for me you guys are all ranged fighters and so they got a lot of attacks of opportunities going on there but that doesn't mean you didn't do damage back thaddeus was even able to poison one of them with his super gun

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** which I do want to just, like, I want to talk about this elephant-sized gun in the room.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** Kelly, you had, what was it, an advanced venom caster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** I'd say it's more like a 50 pigeon-sized elephant-sized gun.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** But, yeah, it's an advanced venom caster.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** It was an advanced venom caster, no longer advanced, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** Yeah, we've actually, like, nerfed it down to a tactical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Which is fair, just fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:42]** It has the rules of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:42 - 00:17:04]** yes it is literally fair it is literally in the fairest sense of the word yes yes thank you two lies and a truth um yeah that was your third lie playing 5d chess and the reason we actually had to nerf it is that like your gun did 3d8 that's right plus poison yeah it was great plus yeah

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** And it's just way too powerful for this adventure.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:13]** And I just want to note just for our listeners, these guys are space pirates, career space pirates, and they are not to be trifled with.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:19]** But this adventure, this book is written for level one player characters.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:25]** And as a first time GM, I'm adhering to the rules of this book for simplicity and sanity.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** My sanity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** Yeah.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** So if you run into these characters anywhere else, they might not be level ones.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** They might be level 14s or something else, depending on the story.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** Hmm.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Yeah.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** All right.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Maybe.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Convince, you know.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** All right.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** So back to business.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Back to business?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Can I hit the business music?

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Hit the business music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** What is that?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Give it the business, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Leroy!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:52]** Is that it?

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:00]** So where we left off, the first Hilki took a swing at Thaddeus and hit.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Bam.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Smack him right in the side of the head.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** And that means that it's my turn to roll some damage.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Wait, before you do that, can you move us over on roll 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Oh, wait.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** I'll move you over to the map.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Sorry.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** That was my bad.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** I'm a new GM.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I'm new to this.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Dude, I still make that mistake.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** You're always going to make that mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:26]** This is my first fight, and this is your first fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** That's wild.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Yes, I'm very excited about this.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Kev, you're doing really well.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** You might murder us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** Might just be a TBK in the first battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:48]** All right, so where we left off is this Hilki smacks Thaddeus in the side of the head with his baton, and he's going to do 1d4 damage.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Wait, no, is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** It better be, because that's about how much damage we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** It's 1d4 plus three, so... Wow.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** You get four points of damage.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** I rolled real high on that one.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Okay.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Nicely done.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:10]** Okay, so now, going back to Kelly's gun, we get to talk about poison.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:14]** So, which kind of poison did this gun have, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:19]** So, at the moment, I have about six rounds of dex poison here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Okay.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** And the dex poison, what's it called?

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Turbocaridine?

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:27]** Turbocaridine or something like that, yeah.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Turbocaridine?

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Something like that.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:50]** um anyways so the first thing you're supposed to do when you get poisoned is to take uh the dc of the poison minus 10 damage yeah so my my second hilki um i has his name is grego you guys don't know his name yet his name is grego um he takes four points of damage right off the bat

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Right.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** He should have actually taken this at the time of the attack.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Oh, man.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** But I'm giving it to him now at the top of this round.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** And he's actually sluggish.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:16]** which Sluggish is a minus two penalty to reflex saves and dexterity-based abilities, attack rolls, skill checks, DCs for spells and special abilities, also decreased by two, and he is flat-footed.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:24]** He takes a minus two penalty to his AC, and you cannot take a reaction or make attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:53]** which is severely disappointing in this situation um dang so the one that is right so for all the listeners we again as a refresher uh we are cornered and we are up in the northwest corner of this alley and there are two of these hill cues right in front of us and you're saying it's the one who is immediately in front of all three of us yeah the one that's like closest to like actually adjacent to the whole group can't take aos is what you're saying yeah thankfully yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:57]** But it's his turn to attack, so he can still swing his weapon.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:06]** My question for you, John, I guess, is how do I know whether or not this NPC is dex-based versus strength-based?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:08]** Does it tell you in the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** What do you mean dex-based versus strength-based?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:16]** It says that dex-based... Oh, it's dex-based ability checks.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yes.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** But it wouldn't affect his to hit or anything, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:23]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** If it doesn't say attack roll, then it doesn't affect his attack roll.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** Okay.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** Because dex-based ability check is literally ability checks that are dex-based.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** Like, there's no... What if he makes an attack, like, a ranged attack that's based on dexterity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** I don't think it's an ability check.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** That's my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** Yeah, I'll agree with that then.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** It would say dex-based attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Also, I feel like all the conditions are pretty explicit.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** If it affects attack rolls, it will say it affects attack rolls.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** Although, to be fair, the sluggish might affect... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Well, I'm rolling with it.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** I'm going to roll my d20, and he's going to attack Thaddeus again.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Yes, of course.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** Secretly rollers like this.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Guys like hitting me with batons in the head.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** It sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** I'm rolling the dice I just got from Raven and Riddle.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Thank you.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** And I'm not exactly sure what this little symbol is.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** I think it's a raven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** So you crit Thaddeus is what you're saying.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** I just crit Thaddeus.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Yeah.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Thaddeus, you good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** No.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** Thaddeus is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Is he going to go down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** I don't know.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** He's already got three hits by these two dudes that are cornering him.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** It's not good at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:45 - 00:23:09]** um so i'm gonna roll but i roll twice and then you so you're gonna get six points of damage just for my my bonuses and i'm gonna roll d4 twice and uh dang that's a four what was and a one for a total of 11 points of damage guys do this much damage to us and we have like damage that we do in return


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:23]** but to be fair you're also doing d4s yeah right okay well thaddeus is lit is down so he's down yeah he's into his resolve or whatever happens at this point it's been so long since i've been here i can't recall


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:27]** Thaddeus is down from these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:39]** Oh my god He's not a tank for sure I wish how many result points do you have three you have three result points and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Okay.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** So you can burn one to stabilize, right?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** You can burn one to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Do we need to break open the rule book and see?

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** You need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** You should look this up.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** It was a crit.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Yeah, that's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** 11 would take almost any one of us down, though.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Yeah, easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** I would go down.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Why do you hate cats, Kevin?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** Why are you just beating up on poor Thad here?

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:18]** Well, maybe in Plot Armor I'll reveal more about what these guys' motivations are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** About why they're overpowered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** Uh-huh.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** And unlike John, I'll actually tell you.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** Hey, man.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** You'll know how it feels, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** If you listened to Plot Armor a few weeks ago, I did reveal a lot more than I usually do.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** I mean, I think we can move on if you want because you're down.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** Look up the rules.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** You're not dead, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** We know you're not dead.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** Score rule book, page 250.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** There you go.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** Thank you.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** And we'll come back to that.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:48]** So now it is Termay's turn.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Termay.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:56]** Actually, that was just one attack, and then my character is going to take a guarded step backwards.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Guarded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:14]** uh kind of kitty corner yeah get it kitty corner because you fool you took down our leader our weapons officer he's like a combat leader

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** I don't even know what that means, but all right.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** You tangled with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** I swear to God.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** I'm done with you fiends.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:36]** And he's going to draw all of the energy, the heat energy around from all the air conditioners, all the technology items.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** And he casts overheat.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Everyone feels really cold.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** So you need to make a DC 14 reflex there.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** DC 14 reflex.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Nice.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Let me just double check.

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:02]** So reflex, I get a plus three, but I get a minus two from the one that's poisoned.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** So he gets hit full on.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** And then the other one got a 20, 17 plus 3.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** So one passes.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** The one that's poison does not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:18]** I don't know if overheat, if it's like DC for half or something.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** It should tell you.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Yeah, it should say.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** It says you collect.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** It just does.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** It says.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:23]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Reflex for half.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Okay.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** For half.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** So still half.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Love it.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Okay.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** So four points.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** It's four and four.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** So eight points total.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** Fire damage to dealt.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:45]** So four points for your saving foe and eight for your other.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Oh, man.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Yes.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:48 - 00:27:05]** so nicely done four points sorry four points for the points total okay and if if you saved you get half yeah yeah so it's four plus fire damage what happens


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:12]** The fire brushes over the two of them, and the one kind of turns his head, and it washes over him, but it hurts.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:23]** The one that's poisoned, on the other hand, just stepped back, and before he even finishes putting his foot down, gets washed by this flame and just falls onto his back.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** And he is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Yes!

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Yes!

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Nice.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** We got the measure of these guys now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Good move to Waden.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Do you want to do anything else in your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Wait, so he's down down?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** He's down.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** Yeah.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** You got to mark him with that big red X on the right.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Sorry, I'm doing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Is he dead or just unconscious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:49]** That is... You'd have to roll a check for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** All right.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Is it the original recipe or extra crisp?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** If...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:20]** monsters don't have resolve points kev so that's that's not for you to decide john that's that's the game what are you talking about it's literally the game dude it's kev's world we're just living in it um so now moving on to termay are you done is that your turn uh yeah i think i don't really have any other move actions okay to uh

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:44]** i'm trying to think if there's like a guarded can i can i like it's a combat maneuver thing a guarded step would be no but not a guard because yeah because you only have a move action left right so yeah combat actions are all standard action i like what could you do as a move action yeah i'm just trying to think uh tactical rules


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:50]** You could take a step forward or take a guarded step forward.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** That's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Yeah.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** You could try and move through a space if you wanted to get to somebody else, right?

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** But I think that you would have to make an acrobatics check, which I think would be a move action.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** But that's probably up to Kev if you wanted to move through or past them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** I can manipulate an item.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** True.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** What would you want to do?

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Or move at speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** We talked about this, though.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** You can manipulate an item, but it's going to take a standard action to use the item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** Right, right, right, right.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** I'm not doing anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Okay, moving on then.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Chuck, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:28]** Seeing our feline friend fall.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Chew with your alliteration.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:35]** I thought you might appreciate that.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** Jack is going to take a two and a half foot step because he's very tiny.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** And...

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** Oh, no.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** Whips.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:56]** He reaches into one of his cavities with one of the tendrils, whips out a Mark one serum of healing and jabs it into Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Nice.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Wow.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Thank you.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** That's amazing.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Wait.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:06]** So you moved, you pulled an item and you used an item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** You know what?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Cool.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** I'm just going to stay where I was instead of moving two and a half feet and do that.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Because I have five feet of reach because I have tendrils.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** He's a Rexalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:32]** That's so cool to think about, like, all the tendrils coming in and, like, moving through your bag and pulling it out and then, like, pulling off the tip of the syringe and then... It's cool.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Right into the leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** Like a healing EpiPen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Right into the butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** The cat butt.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Hit him right in the butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** But that is your turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** That is my turn.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:49]** You get four hit points of healing.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:53]** But you accidentally heal my guy and he stands back.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** No.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Cool.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** That's your turn.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Then we're going to move on to Rolude.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** Move it, move it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Move it, move it.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Nicely done.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** So here's the thing.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:24]** I think Rolu, first thing, seeing Thaddeus go down, was about to make a move to help, but then saw Jack's tendrils come through, stab you in the butt.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:32]** And I think Rolu sees Tormeid and feels the heat wave move past his skin.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** And he just says, great work, team.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:42]** And then he fixes his eyes on the Helki.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Helki?

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Hilki?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Husky?

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** The Husky?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** What's the name?

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Hilki.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Hilki.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** He focuses his eyes on the Husky that is right in front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** There's no Husky, so it's a waste of a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** That's fine.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** Yeah, it's a super waste of a turn.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** The imaginary dog.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:14]** And his two upper arms move forward, and then his fingers point, and they make this rectangle shape.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:27]** And then he just pushes, and you see a little bit behind the husky, the shape of a door, as he casts Death's Door on this Hilti.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:30]** What the hell?

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** What?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** I don't believe this.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:40]** You are going to need to make a DC 14 fortitude saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Okay.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** This is on the...

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** Sorry, 14... Sorry, say it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Fortitude.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Fortitude.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Okay.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Come on!

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Yeah.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** I rolled eight.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** You rolled eight.

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Perfect.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:05]** I imagine that you maybe step back.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** Mechanically, you don't move, but you move back a little bit as the door moves through you.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:14]** And you will take one D10 damage.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** What the hell?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:20]** And you will also take two strength damage.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Okay.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:38]** So unfortunately, I only rolled a two so that is two points of damage to you But it is also two points of strength damage to your weekend Yeah, I need to see what that would be ability damage

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:43]** This is going against our rules of know your character because I didn't look up what strength damage will do.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** 1d10 plus 2 strength damage.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Wow.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** I think it's 1d10.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** So 4.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Sorry.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** So 4 strength damage.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** It's just strength damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** No, it's 1d10 of damage plus strength damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Strength damage is different, right?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Strength damage affects.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** So 1d10 damage to your hit points, 2 strength damage.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** So you did two points of damage.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Yep, so two points of damage.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** And then another, I'll just make a note, minus two strengths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Yeah.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Okay.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Is that your key ability score?

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Do you know?

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Yes, I think.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Really?

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Would it tell you that somewhere?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** I'm just looking at the Starfinder ability damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** It says if it's a key ability, something, something, something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:35]** Yeah, so for every two damage you take, you reduce your ability modifier by one for skills and other things affected by that ability.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:46]** And if you take damage to your key ability score, you also lose one resolve point for every two damage you've taken to that score.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** I don't know if, as an NPC, you have a key ability score.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Or resolve points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I have everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Yeah, true.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You also don't have resolve points.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** All right.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Well, that is that.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** And then I think...

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:07]** What Rolo's gonna do as a last measure is going to... No, he's not gonna do that.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** Oh, this is tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** That was a standard action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Yeah, that was a standard action.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:17]** I was going to see if he was going to move through Thaddeus' square.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Well, he's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** I should put a big X over him, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** Thaddeus is... Thaddeus is not dead.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Get out of here.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Thaddeus has four hit points.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** He has four hit points.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Oh, you're back up.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Damn, you're right.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Sorry, my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** Take out that red X. What are you doing?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** What is the f***, Kevin?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Come on.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Drunk with power.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** I wasn't fast enough earlier.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** You are drunk with power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Alright, that's going to be Rollo's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** For now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** That's Rollo's turn.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Okay.

**[00:35:45 - 00:36:01]** Well, as that happens, the Yosuke is going to run forward and grab the arm with both arms of the guy that's on the ground and start pulling him.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** And he's going to do a full move action to get away, so that's back to there.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** And so I'm just going to

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** Highlight the both of them, and they're going to move.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:14]** I'm going to make a move at half speed, so he's only going to get to about here by the time his turn is over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** Is this like one of the iRobot cars that just pulled up?

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** What?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** Why don't you roll a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** We can roll a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** No, just Vinny so far.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Oh, the car!

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Yeah, there's a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Why did I just see the car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** It's a super high-def car that just, like, cruised up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** Yeah, that just, like, dust following.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** You rolled an eight?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Ocho.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** All right.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:47]** Yeah, you see a shiny car at the end of the thing, but you're not quite sure if it's been there or not.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** It might have been there this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:53]** Um, and now it is Thaddeus's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:59]** You see like that Thaddeus is sort of like face down in the dirt, but you see his tail start to like twitch a little bit.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** It starts like rapidly like twitching like a cat as he is a cat.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** And then he starts to like get up slowly, like grunting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** Can we revisit the rules on, on death?

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** So you were unconscious and you got healed.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** Does that mean you get to go this round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** What page was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** You also need to spend a move action to stand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** That's what I'm going to say.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** It is a move action to stand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Sorry, Kelly.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** I'm just trying to play by the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Right.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** So, this guy's still here, I see.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:37]** So, as he's getting up, Thaddeus kind of looks at Shaq, and he's like, well done, Shaq.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:41]** And he kind of, like, uses the car to, like, help get him up.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** Nice laugh, Shaq.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** And then he braces himself with the car.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** And then he's like... And he looks at this... That was great.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** That was a great... Was that you, Kelly?

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** That was me.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** That was awesome.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** That wasn't like a load-in from Will?

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** That was awesome.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** That was good.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** He's pissed, man.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** He's a pissed cat.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** And he's going to attack him again.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Yes.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** With another ranged attack.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** He can claw the shit out of things.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** He's very good at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** But he chose to do a ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Okay.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** And because of that... Well, hold on a second.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Hold on.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** I'm still thinking this through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** You committed.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** You committed to it.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** You said you're going to do a ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:30]** I don't know if I can do like a... I can do an unarmed strike, but it's not really worth it for what I have going on right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** Do you have a ranged weapon in your hand?

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** Because unless you have improved unarmed strike.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** I have a ranged weapon in my hand.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** So you have a ranged weapon and you shoot the ranged weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** He's trying to go to you.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Why are you smiling in this weird way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** He's trying to get his attack of opportunity.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** He's trying to get the AOL.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** I think I get my AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** Your guy can't do your AOL because he's poisoned.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** That's the other one.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** That's the dead one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Also, what round are we in?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Because Diddy took an AOL already and has used it this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** This is round three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** So that tells me nothing.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Did he already use it this round or not?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** He has not used his.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** No, this is top of the next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** I'm trying to keep you honest, Kev.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** It's fine.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** It's fine.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** It's good that I'm learning that this is what happens when I try to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** You will save?

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:26]** I will say that he does have the minus two strength, so I am going to take two off to attack because I think strength is... It's a plus four instead of plus six to hit is what I'm going to do.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Does that make sense?

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Yes.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** And I hope you fail.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** Natural 20.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:36]** It was a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** I'm not laughing.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** I'm not laughing at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** It's seven plus four.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Thaddeus' fourth life flashed before his eyes.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** It does not pass.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Good lord.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** So it's 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Okay.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** It doesn't make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Does a 13 hit?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** 13?

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** That's a seven plus four.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** I was just checking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Wait, why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Because I took the two off.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** I was just curious if I saved you the hitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Okay, I'm not going to answer questions like that, Kevin.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** I appreciate your approach.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Thank you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** That's a smart move, Thaddeus.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** Don't answer those God's questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:13]** You stand up and you go to shoot this guy, and he swings at you, but he just misses right as you duck underneath him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:18]** You see one of Thaddeus' fangs glint in the sunlight as he grins at that miss.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Amazing.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** And then he's going to roll to attack.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** And here we go.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Let's see how this goes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Ah, f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Wait, is that a d20, though?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** What?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** You rolled a d20, yes.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** It doesn't hit.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** It doesn't hit.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** What'd you roll?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** What did you roll?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Like a five.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** I don't understand.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** I have like a pretty good buff to my range.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** It just rolled really ****.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** So you rolled a five plus what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Plus three.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** No, no, no.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** It's five in total.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** It's five in total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** Oh, you rolled two plus three.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Okay.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Cool.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** So yeah, you shoot and he swings, but like as he swings, your gun goes right past him.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** It's just too close, man.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Amazing.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** Easily telegraphed swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** That's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** That's it.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Stands up.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:11]** And I think one more time, this Hilki is going to take a swing at you.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I thought he... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Right.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Actually, no, no, no.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** I take that back.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** He's going to just do... No, he is.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** So he's going to take a swing at you.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** I hate this guy.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Is he not trying to run away?

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** That's a 15 plus 4.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** So that's going to be 1d4 plus 3 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** Plus three is from what again?

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Plus three or plus one?

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** From where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Yeah.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** 1d4 plus three because it's his baton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** But it's minus two from the strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Why is the baton not plus three?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** This is insanity.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** I'm just reading the book.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** I don't know about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** Just cheating his way through the books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Now you know.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Now you know.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Five possible points of damage.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Point of clarification.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** It should be plus two because two points equals a one point change in the modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:58]** Thank you.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Yes.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** That is the clarity that we need on the show.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** So it's a plus two.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** Okay.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:07]** So how many... You're at four hit points, Kelly?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** Yes.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:13]** So he needs to roll a one or lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** I rolled a three.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** So that's five points of damage.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Wow.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** So he...

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:24]** He dodges, misses that shot, and then he just kind of uppercuts you in the chin with his baton.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:30]** And as soon as that happens, he takes the rest of his turn to sprint out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:34]** I don't understand why their baton attack is so powerful, personally.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** But whatever.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Kev's just rolling really fast.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** It's the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:43]** Kev, I'm guessing you did that to avoid the AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:43 - 00:43:04]** uh yeah because you didn't take a guarded step you just started moving however i had the choice of like aol versus however oh but you had a ranged weapon he didn't have an ao anyway no he had a baton he had a baton that's why i chose the hit i was like it doesn't matter if i hit if i hit or not like right yeah but he doesn't get down and then there's a chance of getting him down yeah

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** So that is the end of his turn.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** It's now, let's see, that Hilkey is down.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** It is now Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Interesting.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** So he's running away now, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** Running away, running away, running away.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Running away now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:42]** where does the plus i'll ask later say again like i'm looking at baton is just a one d i'm just trying to figure out where does the plus three come from it's it's written in the book it tells you what their weapons are it's the same way that you have a plus two attacks he like they also have a plus because their strength of their decks or whatever okay cool that's i just wanted to clarify what it was okay cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** So I guess Torme is going to run up to him.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Yes.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:52]** Seeing him run off and be like, where do you think you're going?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Oh.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Yes.

**[00:43:54 - 00:44:01]** And then just going to hit him with his own little battle staff.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Yes.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** See how he likes it.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** Roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Sweep the leg.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Sweep the leg.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** That is, I don't think it does it.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** What attack are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** It's just, I have a melee weapon, my battle staff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** I just, curious question, did you have your battle staff out before?

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Okay, cool.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** And you rolled an eight, but that does miss.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:28]** So you got to hook the leg and just hit the ground instead.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yeah.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yeah.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** No problem.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Jack, it's your turn now.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Is it Chuck, Jack, Chick?

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** Jack.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** Jack.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Jack.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Jack.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Check.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Check.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Okay.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** Check.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:45]** Um... Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** I just... I do want to say, like, what... Um...

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:57]** Will, as you go to swing at him, you do see across his back is this almost like a biker's outfit.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** What?

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** Like a leather with an embroidered symbol on it.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Like his cover?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Yeah, it's his colors.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** He's got a skull with a banner across the forehead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** Do I know what that... Could I roll to see what... Well, you guys already know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** They're the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Oh, they're the true warriors.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Got it.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** It's just like now you get a real good view.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** You get a real good view.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Real good view.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:27]** Check says... Try this on for size.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Oh, my.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:31]** Pulls out a miniature hunting rifle.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Amazing.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** And fires at the Yosuke.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** I think he might be the only one he has life sign on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:42 - 00:46:04]** that's a 14 to hit oh my uh just let me see yeah is that kac or not that it matters that's a hit is kac yes yeah dope um that is 1d8 piercing for six damage six damage

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** So he fires and hits him, like, right in the hip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Oh, man, that hurts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** That is awesome.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** That is so great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** And that's the end of round three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** The end of round three.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** We're now in round four, and it's Roller's turn.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** It's Roller's turn.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** Kelly, you look really upset.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** I'm okay, Kevin.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Thank you for inquiring.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** I appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Because I, as Kevin, I'm concerned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:35]** Thank you for inquiring how your cheating has affected Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Yeah.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** As the GM, I'm glowing inside.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** I see it.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** Yes, Kev.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Yes.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** He's glowing on the outside, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** That's the key lights.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** That's the key lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:57]** So Rolu sees Tormadin, and part of him is proud for Tormadin chasing after.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:01]** But because Rolu is who he is, he says...

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Tormiodin, be safe.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** We have more important business.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** You might need to let them go.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:15]** And then he bends down and looks at Thaddeus and says, I don't like you, but I need you for now.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:19]** And then he casts blessings of youth on you.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:22]** And... You turn into a kitten.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Do I get younger?

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** No.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** That would be super cool, though.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** No.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** And you...

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Cool.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:43]** Yeah, he's going to take his hand and his hand begins to glow with this blue and yellow interspersed light as he lays it not on your butt.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:51]** And you get back four points of stamina.

**[00:47:52 - 00:48:17]** okay thank you not just hp not just hp so he's still got zero hp but stamina which i think would still bring you up right please tell me it does i don't know if that would do anything dude he's got no health yeah can can you be revived with stamina i'm looking at him right now yeah i know that's a good question you're healing his lawyers you're healing his stamina


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** You're saying you give back stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** The spell provides stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** That's not going to be enough now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** You'd have to heal him.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** So I can't revive him with stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** I don't think you can revive him with only stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:53]** uh there are several ways to stabilize a dying creature including first aid healing and spinning resolve points so you can stabilize a dying creature and keep it from losing any resolve points with a successful medicine check um so i can i'll let you do a medicine check in place of this spell if you want to still glow your make your hands glow and look pretty


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Why, thank you.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** I don't have medicine, though.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** It's trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:02]** Here's how I would... Here's how I imagine that goes.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** He has four stamina points.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:11]** He's still unconscious, but when he has healed any health points, he is revived with those four stamina points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** With those four stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** I'd say that.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** Yeah, he could have just short-rested and gotten all the stamina back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** That's a problem.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:22]** I'm looking up according to just various GMs on forums and stuff.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:26]** They're like, they believe you don't go up when you just have stamina and zero HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** So yeah, it doesn't, you have to have health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** They make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** Got it.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** I appreciate it though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to retcon what I did.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** That was just my stupid mistake.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Unless you'll give me a retcon, Kev.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Hey, you could also lemon law.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:48]** Yeah, I'm genuinely thinking about lemon lawing because that was not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** I mean, it'd be helpful if he wasn't dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** From page 250 of the core rulebook.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Yes.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:01]** It doesn't matter how many stamina points you later regain if you're out of hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** Okay, can I be honest?

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** I would super not have used that at all.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** I had another course of action that I would have done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** Well, let's rewind a little bit and let you do the other course of action.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Redcon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Yes.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Redcon.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** I need, like, the record scratch rewind sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:22]** That's my robotic record scratching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** All right.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:28]** So he says to Tormeiden, you know, be safe.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** You might need to let them go.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** But just in case.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:36]** And then he is going to cast stumble.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:42]** On the Hilki that is right in front of Tormeiden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** What is the range on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Good question.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:49]** It's probably 100 feet plus your 10 feet per cast.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** Why am I the worst person right now?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Horrible.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:57]** So he's going to then move because he can.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** What is your range, though?

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** 25 feet.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Oh, really?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** That's it?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Yeah, it's close.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** So he would need to move up to here.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:11]** He's going to step forward, and he's going to cast Stumble on that Hilkie.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:20]** In which you momentarily transpose the position of the limbs of the target using to move or interfere with its proprioception.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** I like that word.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:25]** And it is going to be a reflex save.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** And it's going to be a DC 13 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Okay.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** DC 13.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** I'm going to roll my tiny dice on this one.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Roll it.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** That's a 19 on the dice.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** So I definitely succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** You definitely succeeded.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:46]** Maybe for a brief moment, you seemed like you were going to fall, and then you just catch yourself, and you keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:51]** It actually, like, your spell looked like a stick going for my ankle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Yeah.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** That is identical to Termay's stick.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** All right.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** Well, that is Rolo's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** All right.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Well, that is the end of Rolo's turn.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Let me get back over to my initiative tracker.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** And now it is the Yusuke warrior's turn.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:12]** And so Yusuke, dragging his partner, is going to pull.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** He's moving at half speed, so he gets about 15 feet.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** And then he gets another 15 feet.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** And as he gets to the car, the door swings open.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** And they climb inside.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:26]** They can't climb inside after moving twice like that.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Come on.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** They get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** That's 15 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Another action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** The door opens and they're actually pulled inside by the person in there.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** But it's not their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** You're right.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:46]** I love how we're all needling Kev's GMing.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** They're in the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** This is what it's like.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** It doesn't matter because it's Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** Well, Thaddeus' tail is just, like, twitching again.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** He's just like... Do you use a resolve point?

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** He can't do anything.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:03]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** So you use a resolve point to stabilize.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** And then he does nothing.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Yeah, he's stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Okay.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** You can do... There is stay in the fight.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:15]** You burn a resolve point to get one HP, and then you're able to stand up and... Okay.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** No.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:17]** Okay.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** That's not a good idea.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Just roll a saving throw there?

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** You burned a resolve point to stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** No, because he is stabilized, yeah.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** He's stabilized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** He's still stabilized.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** That's what I do.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** So now it is the other Hilkey's turn.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Okay, I'll correct this.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** What I'll do is I've got to move everything now.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** Thank you.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** So just to make you guys happy.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** What?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** What?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** The rat, the Yosuke.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Sorry, not rat.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** That's inappropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** Yeah, well, Kev, come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:52]** The Yosuke drops this guy right there and then climbs inside by himself.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Savage.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Savage.

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:02]** And then this Hilki that is standing right next to Tomei, he turns to Tomei and he says, this isn't over.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** What?

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** And he turns back and he's going to do a guarded step.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:11]** He's going to step 15 feet, pick up this guy, and throw him into the car.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** And that's the end of the fight.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** No.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Wait a second.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** There's no way you can do that.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** No.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Kev.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Okay, fine.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:23]** The doors open up, and there's actually three guys inside with machine guns, and they start shooting at all of you.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** So roll reflex saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Okay.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** All right.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Here I go.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Here we go.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** All right.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Hold on.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** I'm behind the car.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** This is what happens.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** So I'm all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** They get in the car.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** Does anybody want to roll a perception check?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Yes.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** I'll roll perception.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Okay.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** I'll let Terme roll one.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** And Rolu, you can roll one with a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Wait, why do I have a minus two?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** I'm standing right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** Because you're further back and you guys are being assholes.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** You're behind the big yellow box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** There's no minus two.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** I rolled a 12 plus three.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** You can't tell.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** I'm the GM.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** I'm telling you how to play.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:56]** I got a 15 for my perfect perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** All right, you miss it.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Sorry.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** I got a 19.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** 19.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** Okay, so the 19 gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** But the 13 didn't get it.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** No, the 15 got it.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:11]** I love how petty this is dissolved to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:18]** When we do go to video, it's going to be really great because there's so much happening right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:26]** So as that door swung open and everybody's stumbling inside of this car, you see a stern, hilky woman waiting in the backseat of this car.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:33]** She locks eyes with you for a moment and then the door slams shut and the car speeds away and disappears into traffic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Would I recognize her?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Like, is she famous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** You could try to roll a culture check or something.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** Rolu says, Tormadin, did you see that stern, hilky woman sitting in the back of the car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Yes, I rolled a 15.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** I think she's so-and-so.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** I'm so proud of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** Does the license plate say, don't troll-oo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** Yeah, don't troll-oo.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Sorry, what did you say you rolled, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** I rolled 15 on my culture check.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:08]** Plus, I do have a... As a grifter, I have theme knowledge of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:33]** commercial organizations and businesses uh so if she's like a merchant or if she's like a shady sort of i have a merchant uh theme knowledge well you didn't get this from your culture check but you can you can probably surmise that she is a part of the true warriors yeah are we still in okay so if we're not then we should talk about this she's in the getaway car


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** How is that not free?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** How is that not what?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** Free.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** She's an accessory to this crime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** Yeah, she's a true warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** I got nothing from my culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** No, you got nothing from your culture.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:57]** So yeah, we'll exit initiative order unless you guys want to go back and do another round of wasting time and move checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Is that what we were doing?

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, we weren't just playing the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** I could have killed Thaddeus one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** How is the female Yusofu looking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** What do you mean?

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Like, is she attractive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** Like, is she unconscious?

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** That's what he wanted to know.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** Yeah.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** Oh, the Asoki.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** I thought you were still talking about the Asoki.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** Canonically, Raxalites are horn dogs, but no, is she conscious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** I got to switch gears.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:25]** So yeah, you could roll a DC medicine check on the mouse if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** The Asoki.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** I'm not trained in medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** That's awesome.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** I'm not trained in medicine either.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Thaddeus is still down.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Does anybody have any more healing serums?

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Check.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Do you have any more healing serums?

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** I've got one more.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** All right.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** I'm going to need you to give that to Thaddeus immediately.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** And he says so begrudgingly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Stay still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Slams your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Oh, you get eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** Oh, nice.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Nice.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Nice.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Nice, Shaq.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Yeah.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** Rolu's going to help you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** And as you guys are doing that, you guys hear this like groaning.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:08]** And the Yusuke woman actually pushes up and she stands up, dusts herself off.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** And she's like, I had them on the ropes there, but thanks for the assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:32]** i'm not so sure that that was the situation but uh the point is that you're okay you feeling okay you you've you were down for quite a while she's got she's got blood dripping from her her the what's this called brow her brow that's the word her brow yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Yeah.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** And she's got blood hanging from her mouth.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** You're actually going to show you what she looks like.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Oh, all right.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Does that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Oh, yes.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Oh, man.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Lots of cuts.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Great artwork.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Yeah.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** So she's she's pretty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** You don't look so good, lady.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** I'm good.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** I'm good.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Are you sure?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** I don't think that means what you think it means.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** I'm fine.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Why were they assaulting you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:08]** Can we just... Look, I own Junkers Delight down the road, and if you guys want to talk about this, we can go back there.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** I can maybe reward you for what you did.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:13]** I don't know, maybe... We need to be told to find you.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** What do you mean, finally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:18]** We heard you called the Riddle.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** Is that true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** I am Riddle.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** My name is Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** And I own Junker's Delight.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:31]** And like I said, you guys can come over or maybe get a reward or something.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** But like...

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I could also maybe give you a job if you guys are looking for one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** Maybe.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Maybe.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** Just slow down here for a sec, Riddle.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:46]** Sorry, so you were just beat up, and then now you're saying that you have a job for us?

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:51]** Maybe we should follow you back to this Junkers Delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Is your cat friend all right?

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** I'm all right.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** He's just like holding his leg.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** That hurt.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** We're looking forward to Trolu, aren't we?

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** Wasn't that part of what we're here to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Did you say the Trolu?

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** The Trolu?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:17]** Look, yeah, why don't you guys, why don't you come back to Junkers and I'll, we can sit down and talk about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:23]** Before we do, how do we know that when we go back, you won't, something might not happen like what happened to you, to us.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** We might get beat up.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** How can we trust you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** Well, it's more like, how can I trust you guys?

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:32]** But like, you know, like we could all just take chances, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:36]** We just saved you, but let's just do it, Cobb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** What was that all about anyway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Look, I don't want to stay on the streets any longer, all right?

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** There's something else might happen.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** We should probably get somewhere safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Let's go to this Junkers Delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** Let's go.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]** All right, so Riddle starts to lead you down the road just shortly.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]** You guys saw the sign earlier, but there's a large sign in front of a store.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:03]** There's a storefront between a hardware store and this dingy boarding house, and there's a large, unilluminated neon sign that juts out of the building saying, Junkers Delight.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Oh!

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** You guys saw it on my main screen.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]** It's got the neon lights on one and the bulb lights on the other.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:19]** Riddle unlocks the door and then just for you guys to come in, she looks up and down the street before she locks the door behind her.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:31]** Uh, once you're inside the building's interiors, um, it's, it's a very eclectic mix of decorations, brightly colored posters showing cartoonish figures, uh, excitedly examining bits of crash starships.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:38]** There's racks of mass produced trinkets, such as little globes that display holographic names organized alphabetically.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:45]** Um, there's artistic statues kind of, uh, crafted from bits of metal debris welded together kind of here and there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Check immediately starts looking for his name.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:58]** You also notice that there's three desks that are... There's a couple chairs on one side, a computer, and then another chair on the other side.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:02]** And each of these desks look pretty dusty and unused.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:08]** The air in this room is stale, as if it hasn't been even opened up in several days.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:09]** Um...

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** I can put some tea on for you.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Do you have grape Fanta?

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** Grape Fanta, yeah.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:42]** It's actually, if you look in the fridge, that's pretty much all that's there.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Just grape.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** Nuts.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:50]** So she brings you, you know, she brings out the tea for you guys and she hands it to you and she sits down.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:59]** She sighs real big and she goes, okay, look, a few months back, this nonak shabab named

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:05]** And Dotrulu came to town and put a bunch of pressure on the junk tourism agencies around here to pay him protection money.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:10]** And now, look, I was born in Kefauk Depot, and we're a tough bunch.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:13]** Usually some of these goons, they try these rackets, they get run out of town.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:19]** But Dotrulu, he brought some muscle from Morrow down.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** The true warriors.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** That's who those guys were.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** And they aren't afraid of busting people up, if you've seen.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:28]** And as she says that, Riddle kind of winces and touches her ribs.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:37]** Look, most of these other agencies have started paying Dutch Rulu, which has made him a little bit bolder.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:41]** He sets himself up to be like the crime boss of all at Kavok Depot.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:50]** And even though he's paid off or run off all but one of my favorite guides, there's no way I'm going to let him take over and get what he wants.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** There's no way.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** And she grins through bloodstained teeth as her grimace kind of turns into pain.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:00]** And then she tells you like, hey, I don't recognize you guys.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** You must be new in town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** That's right.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:08]** We've been conscripted, so to speak.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Oh, you guys are Navy?

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** No.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** Well, we're pirates, but... Close.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** Close enough.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Navy in a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:22]** What you should know is... Jack takes one of his shendrills and shapes it like a hook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** We've got a job to do also.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:28]** And it seems like our interests have aligned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:34]** Well, I think, like it or not, you're probably on the true warrior's bad side now that you rescued me, of all people.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:35]** Maybe.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** They're on our bad side, too.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** I think we'll be all right.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** I'm sure we'll be fine.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** I mean, I kind of pride myself.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** I'm like the last holdout.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** Everybody else is kind of already caved.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** But if you guys don't mind helping me, there's money in it.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:56]** I mean, it's slow around here at the moment, but that doesn't mean I don't have big clients.

**[01:04:56 - 01:05:00]** In fact, I got a big one that walked through my door just the other day.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:03]** There's some kind of historian from Absalon Station.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** They got more credits than Common Sense.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:14]** They say they're looking for some unclaimed pieces of salvage in the junkyards that could change the galaxy.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:15]** She throws air quotes up.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:20]** The only problem is they've gone missing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** Is this that job you were talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Oh!

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** What a cliffhanger.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:28]** Kev!

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:29]** Kev.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Exotic pieces.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Dotrulu.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** Missing historians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:48]** Until next week, drift begones and distance stars.
