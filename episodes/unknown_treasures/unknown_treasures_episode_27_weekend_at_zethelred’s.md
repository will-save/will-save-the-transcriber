**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** All right, welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:02]** I'm Kevin.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:02]** You know who I am.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:04]** And here's the rest of the crew.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:06]** We have Will, Vinny, John, and Kelly.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** Round of applause.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** Yay!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:15]** Happy We'll Save Wednesday.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** Happy We'll Save Wednesday.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Happy Wednesday, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:23]** I'm actually going to Bogart the banter.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:23]** What?

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** In a surprising turn, we're not going to talk about food.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** I don't believe you.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Yet.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** We're going to talk about accessories.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Food and accessories.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** Chiquita banana hats.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Condiments?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Propane accessories?

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:45]** I recently got one of those grail items.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** You know those things that you always wanted as a kid?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** But maybe you had to wait until you were an adult to buy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** Every Lego set ever made?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Yeah.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** That would count.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** So here we go.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Those on video will get it.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** So I finally bought my first pair of J's.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Wow.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** They look nice.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** They're white and gray.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I'm really happy with them.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** Are you a sneakerhead?

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** I was not before I bought these, but I think I might be.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:23]** I've always appreciated them, but it's one of those that was just like, I couldn't justify the lavish expense.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** And I'm like, all right, I'm an adult.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** I'm at a reasonably stable point in my life, so I'm trying to buy some shoes.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:36]** So the question is, what's your item that you really appreciate within your closet?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:43]** What's your grail item that you've purchased or that you're just like, for me, part of it's these shoes.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Part of it's my will save ball cap.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** I wear that out more often than I think my wife would like.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Um, but I really like it.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** It's a good snapback.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:57]** Anyway, uh, I'm going to tap Kev cause he looks, uh, he looks intrigued by this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** I look confused more than anything else.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:07]** Um, I, so, you know, you've already heard the stories about how I used to just wear, um, loafers and jeans to everywhere.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** And I'm still that way.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** Like I'm very simple about like, I just want to throw on clothes and move about.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** So I don't really have like that in my closet.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Um,

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** I do say I do have like special shirts that I lean to.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:22]** And like one of them is my Green Bay Packers shirt, especially on NFL Sundays when the Packers are playing.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** I want to wear that.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** And I try to wear a USC shirt on Saturdays just to show my support for my teams.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** But like Holy Grail wise, you're asking about hats.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:38]** I don't wear this often, but I keep it up on my shelf here.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:43]** And I really am upset that I missed the opportunity to put this on.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]** We played Traveler with Emergency Power Podcast.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** Go listen to that, Power Pack number one, or volume one.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:55]** And at the end of the show, it's revealed that my character moves on to become a pirate captain.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:59]** And I forgot to put it on his pirate hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** That is spectacular.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Good reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:09]** It was on top of my front shelf, and I stood up and did the whole reveal of it, and I didn't even realize my hat was up there until after we stopped recording.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** I was like, man.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** but yes, this pirate hat, I got it for, I think my 30th birthday, 32nd birthday.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** We went to the like pirates version of medieval times.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** And my parents, that's a pretty dope thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** That is actually pretty fun.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** That's a hat.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** Jack Sparrow would be proud of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Yeah.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** It's quite nice.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:33]** The only thing that might make it better is the three hats that John is wearing.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Yeah.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** John, you get to go next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** I mean, I think it's clear.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:44]** I'll just do my countdown in terms of hats, what I typically wear.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:51]** I'd say that, you know, this is number one, the white rope, black, good workout hat.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** A little tuxedo action, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Yeah.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** Then the obligatory...

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Hawaiian trucker hat.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Classic.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** You always need a good trucker hat.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** I have two good Hawaiian trucker hats, believe it or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** I feel like you need more than one.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** And then, of course...

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** The will save.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Ah, the will save.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** The will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** That's a nice... Will save!

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** We all have will save hats.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** I'll just say that.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** All the cast members have will save hats.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:26]** Some of us have the all black, but John has the special like black body gray bill.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** You have a gray one too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** I like the two tone.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** You should have a gray one.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:37]** I need the all black because we need to decide if are we doing the all black or...

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** look?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Are we going to do both?

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:45]** Do we have cast member special ones that we only give out at certain times?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:51]** I looked at the all black as the special cast member one, but maybe we revisit that.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:59]** And don't forget to the listeners, you can still go on and use our Snapchat filter to try on your very own Will Save hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** That's true.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** And maybe one day it'll be available in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** Search for Will Save on Snapchat.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** I think it works best on mobile, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Courtesy of Will Garrett.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Courtesy of Will Garrett.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** I do a thing.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** I really like wearing that hat.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Can you flip it around?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Or Will?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** Because there's like a really nice detail over the snapback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** There it is.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** Yeah, so for... Oh, that's right.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, it is essentially the We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** It's literally a walking advertisement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** Yeah, it is our website, but arced nicely over the snap in the back.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** It's a really nice detail.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's a really nice detail.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** For grail items, I'll say this.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:48]** I like watches, and I don't have enough money to get...

**[00:06:48 - 00:07:08]** watches so i i do have a really nice fossil that uh that my fiance ariel got me and it is fantastic and i usually wear that to weddings and i also really appreciate my apple watch and i need to get a new one and then from there i need to actually get more watches

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** I'm definitely feeling the sneakerhead vibe, Benny.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:19]** I feel like lately I've been getting a little more like I have like blue Nikes that are white with like the blue check and like the tan bottom.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** And I wear those everywhere.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** And I'm starting to see more of that and other cool sneakers.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** I'm like, maybe I should move into that.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Yeah.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** But I will say the one thing I did just buy, I bought myself.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** I'm not usually like...

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:36]** I really enjoy feeling like I bought something that I want to wear, and then I wear it, and I'm like, this feels good.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:39]** Whatever it is, any accessory or piece of clothing, and I'm like, I liked this.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** I wanted to wear it.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** I feel that way about the shirt that I'm wearing now.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** It was great.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** It's like the color.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** It's like the fit.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** It's great.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:51]** But I did buy myself a Ted Baker shirt that's like...

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Is that a serial killer?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** Yes.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** It's just a fashion brand.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:01]** And I bought myself this polo, but it's a long-sleeve polo.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** And it's gray, and they're British.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** So it has this neat green diamond collar.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** And I like the way I look in it.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:14]** I spent a pretty penny getting that shirt because I was like, you know what?

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** This feels like a nice investment.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** And I've worn it, and it's been like...

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Yes.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:24]** So that is all to say that that was my, my most recent purchase of, I like something, I buy it, it fits.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** I like, I feel good wearing it.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** And that's why I think you should do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** And it's a really good practice.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:36]** Something that I've done recently is just like, I got rid of most of my wardrobe because it didn't feel like me.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Like it was just stuff that I've collected over time.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Yeah.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:46]** And if you, if you notice what I, I like, I almost exclusively wear solid color V-neck t-shirts and,

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:49]** Sometimes I'll wear a brand like I'm wearing a Sweetwater shirt.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Shout out Sweetwater.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** They provided a fair bit of our hardware.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Yep.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** And these shirts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:59]** And I get compliments on that shirt every time I go out, by the way.

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** Yeah.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** It's a good shirt.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** You're a sexy melon farmer, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Kev, you had your hand up.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Did you want to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Yeah, I want to reclaim my time.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** You mentioned watches.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** There was a time in my life.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:15]** It was, I think, middle school that I used to carry around a pocket watch.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** It was pretty fashionable.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** It had a train on it, and I had it slung into my chain on my waistband.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Were you in middle school in the 1600s?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Were you in a suit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** No, I was just weird.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** I'm just a weird kid.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Pocket watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Yeah.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** There was a chain with a wallet, but the chain with the watch.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** I had the wallet in my back pocket, and I had the watch in my front pocket.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** I better get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Don't want to miss my carriage.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** I know for a minute that was popular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** Did you have to adjust your monocle in order to read it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** I had to wind it up and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Everything's on chains, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Could I light another candle in here?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** It's too dark.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** I can't see what's going on.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** You can see my pocket watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** Between that and Will's nightgown, I think we're...

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** It is true that Kevin and Will are... Scrooge Dyke out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Kelly making fun of me.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** What do you got going on?

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** What's your... Yeah, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:13]** Well, I don't wear antiquated garb like you do, but like... As he stands up in a colonial outfit.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** Old barrister with the wig.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:29]** I once did think that I was kind of cool in high school by wearing, like, when the Matrix came out, I would, oh, God, this is embarrassing, but I would wear, like, those f***ing, like, trench coats and s***.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:30]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:34]** It probably looked like a f***ing, like, school shooter or something, but, like, yeah.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** I had, like, the priest collar one.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** That was pretty cool.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** That's awesome.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** For a day.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** We'll coordinate on that.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Your grail nightgown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** My grail nightgown?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** No.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:32]** It's so funny because everything that was mentioned at some point in my... I roomed with a sneakerhead who now works at Nike.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:37]** And I actually got a free pair of shoes for helping him move.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** But I don't have those shoes anymore.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:48]** But I do have a really sweet pair of... They're the Nike Air Mags.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** They're like the Marty McFly shoe from Back to the Future 2.

**[00:11:53 - 00:12:15]** yeah those things look dope you have you had them the ones that no i have those i have those now they're somewhere packed away um but that's not my grail item and i do have a plethora of hats i wear a lot of hats metaphorically speaking as well as literally speaking um

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** I am currently wearing a WillSafe hat.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:24]** I have my brother-in-law's seed and maintenance company for farm equipment.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:32]** I've got my day gig vacation hat somewhere.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:38]** I'd say my item, and also I wore a trench coat in high school.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:43]** And they thought I was a bomber or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** I was never that weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** They thought I was a teacher because some of my trench coats were actually not for the Matrix at that time.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** And then I would be like, yes, I'm a teacher, absolutely.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** And then just walk into the teacher's area.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** I was bored.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** Our magnet school wouldn't allow us to wear certain things.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:10]** So a trench coat was the only thing that actually loosely fit within the dress code.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** But I was the only person who wore one.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** Everyone else wore like, just broke the dress code rules.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Anyways.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:40]** So my thing that I, my piece is actually, it's not even like a piece of, if I'm entertaining and I'm either on the grill or in the kitchen or mixing cocktails or doing something, I am wearing my Hedley and Bennett apron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Aprons are so underrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** I have a great face when you said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Well, you mentioned hats.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** When I was younger, I used to collect all sorts of hats.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** That was the thing I collected.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Yeah, I have like 50 hats right now.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** I had them on my wall for a while.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** These days, I don't wear hats very often.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:05]** I think the Navy did that in because you had to wear a hat every day as long as you're outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Your cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Yeah, cover.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** But these days I wear three hats.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:15]** I wear my Packers hat that I got from Lambeau Stadium.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** I like flex fit hats, so I can wear front or back if I want.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:26]** I still have a flex fit hat from my ship, so it says SSN 752 USS Pasadena.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** And then the third hat that I wear is Game Master.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Let's play.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** There it is.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Take off my pirate hat.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** Put on my game hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** It's a metaphorical hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** That's right.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** All right.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** He's not wearing a hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Yeah, no hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** He's literally not lying about expectations.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** It's a metaphorical hat.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** It's very large and made of junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** I just imagined like a giant sombrero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** It's like a Chiquita banana hat out of junk.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Yeah, amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** All right.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:16]** So last time you found three goblins that pulled an electrolytic capacitor that you needed for Merc's device, and they pulled it out of a tower made for Tinkerton.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:21]** Before a fight broke out on behalf of Tremay's threats, Chalk stepped in and turned the conversation around.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:31]** The result was several bluff checks, which convinced the goblins that you two are followers of Triune and that they should probably return the device back to the Tinkerton Shrine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Those were exceptional bluff checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Phenomenal.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** I have a very high bluff skill.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** Also, I didn't even add in all my bonus for that.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** I actually should have been more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** Just cause you're like, just cause it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Throw a little extra.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:52]** Um, so they, you got them to get, you convinced them to, to put it back in the shrine.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** And actually as you, as they were putting it back up, you help them guide it back into the spot where they pulled it from.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:01]** And after they left, you managed to keep the shrine, um, vertical.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** That's the word I use.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** Keep the shrine vertical as you pulled that piece back out.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:12]** Um, to hear that conversation though, with the, with the goblins, you did catch the term, the name bomb guzzle.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:22]** And you return back to Merc and Cash, you give them the capacitor, and you learn from them that Bomb Gozzle is actually the second smartest goblin in the Outer Junk Fields, next to Merc.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** And he is actually the leader of the Trash Hunters.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:32]** You also find out that he's built up some kind of special armor, presumably to protect the Trash Hunters from Tinkerton.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:42]** Because Tinkerton may be their deity that they praise and the embodiment of Triune, but Tinkerton is still violent and dangerous.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:51]** Because of this, you guys actually choose to seek out the goblins and learn more and maybe even convince them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** Maybe we can get that armor off of them to fight Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** Yeah, we're going to steal the armor from Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** Or the technology behind it.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** Are goblins medium creatures or small creatures?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** They're small creatures, yes.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Not tiny, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** They're small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** You're a tiny creature, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** You are.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Does Bomb Guzzle have any...

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** children that he wants to gift?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:25]** Well, that you would have to learn more about goblins and how they procreate.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** I'd have to look up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Let's do it.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Game on.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** All right, Kev.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Google space goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:40]** After dark, goblins get frisky.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** They start tinkering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:47 - 00:18:02]** love it amazing kelly's smirk for yeah i'm just it was my imagination his imagination took over share with the class kelly no it's fine i don't want to talk about goblins doing doing goblin things


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** That's on the member's only Patreon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:11]** Yeah, it's on the Will34 forums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** It's on our spicy site.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** It's our only fans.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Only goblins.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** I feel like we need the Will Save After Party or something.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** That's the spot we were talking about.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Cool stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** Okay, go ahead.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Cue it up.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Really?

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Really?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** This is real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Okay, cool.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** All right, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:56]** All right, so Goblin Legend claims that long ago, a tribe of surprisingly clever goblins stowed away on a spacecraft that left Galarian and made its way to Absalon Station.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:03]** where goblins infiltrated the station's worst neighborhoods and set up camps in its engineering passages.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:08]** Over time, these goblins learned to build weapons and scavenge armor for themselves.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** They also managed to hijack ships and spread throughout the stars.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:23]** Nowhere are they as prevalent as on Epsilon station, but they do, uh, grace the greater outfields of all the universe.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:30]** Um, thanks to goblins rapid reproduction rate, many generations have passed since those are the first goblins.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:35]** And so they, they've actually grown and become taller than the goblins of the old age.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** So they were shack-sized at one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** I think we glossed over a very important detail in that.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** What's that?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** They reproduce at a very high rate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Very high rate.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:54]** So they are very... Numerous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** They're very what, Will?


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Numerous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Until next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:05]** They are a bit more intelligent, instinctively able to take part of technology and rebuild it to suit their own whims.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:17]** While some spaceships still worship goblin hero gods of old, partially adapting their dogma to fit their current life cycles, many revere Triune, the machine god.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** And I think that's a good place to end.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** That was nice.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:27]** So that doesn't answer your question about whether the bomb gazelle has a lot of children, but I think it's fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:35]** It's fair to assume that if he's a healthy goblin, then he's got a healthy appetite for making more goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:41]** Not quite sure how the trash hunter society is, but being the leader might also have some perks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** He's got a healthy appetite for junk, as it were.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** For junk.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Cool.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Is it for that Vesk's junk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I'm not sure.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** It's not a Vesk.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** He loves the junk.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Is that the right?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** No, I don't like where this is going.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Who's the Australian lizard that's... Harkesti.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Yeah, Harkesti.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** I don't know, dude.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** It seems like they're close.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** He's got a harag on for some junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** That's Merc, not Bomb Guzzle.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Bomb Guzzle's the leader of the treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** No, I know, but Merc is a goblin and therefore horny as f***.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** She has... Like, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** I didn't know if, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Alright, so moving on.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:20]** You guys decide to do a survival check in order to hunt down.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** Is it hunt down?

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Is that the proper term?

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Not necessarily violently.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** We're just looking for the trash hunters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** I don't like the connotation of hunting down because we're not trying to kill them.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:36]** We wish to speak with... We are the Starship Enterprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:40]** This is a diplomatic mission.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** We must not violate the prime directive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:45]** I feel like it's definitely under Kirk more than Picard for sure.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** This is definitely a Kirk mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:51]** It's just a little bit more like left for sure.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** We are actually the marquee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:58]** Who is or is not wearing environmental protections at this point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** If we're heading out across the desert, then I would assume that we're going to put them on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** We always have them on, pretty much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** I want confirmation.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** I want you to say I am wearing them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** I am wearing my environmental protection suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:18]** I am now wearing them after having taken them off, after having arrived at the location where we were staying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** Yeah, we had to do all those, like, whatchamacallit...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:27]** So here's where I'm going to turn this around.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:31]** Because again, GM, you are the eyes through which we see the world.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** Like, is there any indicator that we need to turn it on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** I would say that at this time of day, you would know you definitely need it now.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** So you all turn them on.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** Please keep track of how much you've worn them down.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:47]** You should be down at least eight hours, I'd say, over this time period.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** Because I'm assuming you guys didn't wear them overnight.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** So you have some math on that.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** No, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** Just keep, keep, keep that in mind where it's done and you may or may not need them as we go.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:04]** So you guys travel the wrong, you, uh, you're looking for the trash hunters.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** You're trying to follow whatever trails you can of goblins.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:16]** You, you find goblin tracks almost everywhere, but it's very hard to distinguish like what is current and what it was is older than, you know, what's new, what's, what's next.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** Um, so you end up in a ravine, uh, of several wreckages, just starship after starship left and right.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Um,

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:28]** And every once in a while you feel eyes on you.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Go ahead and roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** It's the middle of the day.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** It's going to be later towards the afternoon at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** Oh, this is going to be good.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** All right.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** With that, 19 was the highest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** No.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** 24.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** All right.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Check.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** With a 24, you kind of catch it all.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:06]** You see several shadows and almost bodies moving around in the junk on the ridges.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:12]** Some of them look at you and pay attention, but you can't quite make out who they are.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:17]** As soon as it catches your glimpse on you or on them, they disappear.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** But others...

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** you recognize to be goblins and they raise their hands and they see you and they say, I'll place to learn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** I'll place to learn.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** I'll place to learn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:40]** We're talking there, a hundred feet or more up the side of some kind of spaceship and just kind of like lining the ridges every once in a while, sporadically.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** Do you guys want to continue on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:49]** So to summarize, to make sure I get it, Jack, because of his 24...

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:54]** notices lots of goblins watching us as we come in.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Some pay us no mind.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** Some give us the all praise triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** I can neither confirm nor deny exactly what you said just then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:07]** I can say that the ones that said all praise for you were goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Oh, okay.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Cool.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** All right.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** It's just like an arena where we get effed up.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:19]** This is going to be my interpretation, and Kev, you're going to have to stop me if I'm way off.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:26]** Hey, guys, we're definitely not alone, as he looks around the ridges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:32]** Yes, I see some fate, something, whatever my 19 gave me.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:39]** I also think we should maybe, I don't know, be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** Well, these goblins, some of them really seem like they're behind us.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:48]** Like they agree with our, you know, triune affiliation.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** Others, I don't even know if they're goblins.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Not so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:08]** Well, perhaps our currency and good faith with the goblins of the trash hunters may carry us further with those who are not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Good luck with that.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:16]** You don't exactly find a solid place to communicate with any individual goblins.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:26]** And along the way, you actually come to an area where you realize this is actually what Merc was describing to you.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:35]** And as you wind your way around starship wreckage after starship wreckage, you find an area where most of the debris radiates from a central clearing.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:40]** as though pushed out by violently or thrown.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:48]** Save for one single slanted metal platform that has a transparent aluminum screen as one of its sides.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:57]** A trio of broken starship councils stand on that platform, the only remains of a small ship's bridge.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:03]** Through the aluminum screen, though, you can see a figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:27]** kind of figure let me show you the map the map here we go that's becoming one of my favorite sentences here we go here we show you it's it's a great thing does that mean some about to go down yeah so this map


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:57]** again this similar like sketched art style with the brown and red and tan desert floor and it's exactly as Kev said where we you know there's an area that's been pushed out and in the center is this big slanted piece of metal that takes up most of the area and then we see some sort of bridge essentially or portal into on the other side of this metal we see this like freestanding structure

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:07]** Where a figure is wearing is Kev has obscured the token with green and Will has made cool sunglasses and a mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:11]** And I think we're talking to... That's exactly what this character looks like underneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** That's so wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Wow.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Good guess, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** So cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Giant Ninja Turtle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** There also appears to be...

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** This just was probably more trash, but it could be like an escape pod.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** But there just seems to be some odd piles of trash nearby.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** That could be important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Yeah.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** It looks like Kevin added extra trash up in the upper right corner.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** You say I'm trashy?

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** Like, yeah, he's like, I want more trash here.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** You're the junk master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** I am the junk master.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** All right.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** So what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** Before we get into combat, can we clearly define what's covered and what's not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** No.

**[00:28:51 - 00:29:18]** oh man that's a good question um so let me let me just go over this so again we talked about the map there's this large uh platform or plate in the middle of the map yeah um it's it's actually you know just maybe two or three feet high um and let me just do real quick a drawing freehand uh the edges wherever this this uh item is that's not green i want green

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:24]** is actually going to be considered, what's the term for it?

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** Difficult terrain.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:31]** So wherever the platform edge is, is difficult terrain.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Once you're on top of the platform, it's no longer difficult terrain.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:38]** So basically what that means is you lose a move action in order to pass through it.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** So if you're walking along the edge, you're going to go at half speed.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** But if you're just moving onto the platform, it takes two moves in order to get up.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** How high is the platform?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Probably two and a half, three feet.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** At some spaces, it's five, depending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Waist high for a medium creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** Chalk, you're going to have to just jump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Double jump?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** I don't know what the rules are on your movement versus anybody else's.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** You'll have to look that up.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** So that's that.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** What was your other question?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** I think if you're standing on any other junk, it is also difficult terrain.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** So you see all the patches of junk laying around.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:18]** And then at the other side is the platform where Will is drawing all sorts of pictures on my mysterious figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Yeah.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:29]** I'm going to have to work on that sensor plug-in for the eggplants that Will was drawing on the map.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** I don't think he was drawing eggplants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Yeah, there was an eggplant.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** Yeah, there was totally an eggplant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** A giant one.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** It's definitely coming from somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** Okay, so you guys are all coming in on the right side of this map.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** The figure is all the way on the left side, and there's that giant platform in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** That has difficult terrain to get up to it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** Up onto and around, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Around it?

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** So like going through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:04]** Yes, if you were on the edge of this thing at any point, wherever there is a square where the edge passes through, that square is considered difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** So, okay.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** If I'm on the ground, though, and I go through this square, for instance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** That is difficult terrain right there, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Got it.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** So does anything, nothing happens as we walk into this clearing?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** There's no...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Did you walk into the clearing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:24]** We are... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** You're at the edge of the clearing.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** It is up to you how you proceed.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** That is what I am asking you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Got it.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** And we can't see this other dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** You could see the other dude.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** What is he doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** What does he look like?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** What is she doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** Do you want to roll a perception check?

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Okay.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Well...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:50]** You made it seem like they were obfuscated, like we can't see them at all.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** So is there any way to get more detail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** It's not a very clear figure.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** They are behind a screen, and I can reveal that screen to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** To me, I can't perceive very well.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Do you see anything?

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:07]** I don't know what a 15 gets me as far as seeing what's ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** I think I can see maybe a bit further with my 17.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Jack got a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Jack, what do you see?

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Kev, what do I see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** A figure behind a transparent aluminum screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** My God, Kevin.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** Is it transparent or translucent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** I don't know what else you guys want me to do.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Hold on.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** We already knew that.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** We cracked this whole game open.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Yeah.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:36]** Hey, we filled our check, but let me tell you exactly what's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:39]** I think what we should do is... And you failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** It's cool.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** No big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** All right, all right.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:52]** I think we should go around the edge and avoid this platform thing and try to get behind that screen and maybe we can...

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Surprise our way into a conversation without doing combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** I don't think we need to roll surprise in anything.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** I wasn't saying roll surprise.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** We would be surprising him by sneaking up.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** I don't know that we need to sneak is what I was trying to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** I can see that there's some sort of creature over there, but I can't see who it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:20]** I just see that he's behind a big fortification in front of a bunch of terrain that could be considered a fortification.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:28]** You know, getting around fortification to if we have to fight this guy, then, you know.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:40]** I'm not trying to think tactically here, but... Since I think I'm probably the smallest of us, let me see if I can sneak around and see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:50]** Before you go, Jack, I just want to say I think these are all great ideas to avoid a combat, but don't feel like the best when you're trying to approach a party asking for their help.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:54]** It might be better to be straightforward in our dealings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Instead of sneaking, because that would seem suspicious.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Is that what you're saying, Carlton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:07]** I think if taking somebody off guard might be, might get us off on the wrong foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:14]** Maybe, but you're small, Shaq, and it's no fault of your own if you can't see.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:20]** If he looks at you, just wave, you know, your little vines and be friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Pretty likable plant.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Yeah.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** So check edges around to the northern point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** You're going to use stealth with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** Sure.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** I mean, short of like dropping something heavy.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Jack is shorter than this platform.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** This is like, I don't want a metagame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Yeah.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Well, 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Okay.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:55]** as you sneak around, you do hear a rumble that goes throughout the area.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:12]** The people up on the, uh, but it's, it's, I mean, it's loud and it, it's a shift, almost like an earthquake, but you can't tell where, where it's coming from or how far away it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Hmm.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Um,

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:33]** What if this is an altar for sacrifice and this barrier from our masked friend or our obfuscated friend across the way is to protect him from that?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** And we just let Chak walk into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** Yeah, I think we should probably follow up.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** Rolo's going to step in and start heading over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:50]** I'm going to stay out just so that I can rescue one of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:56]** Jack is making his way counterclockwise around the map over behind the northerly pile of trash.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** I'm assuming you want me to make another stealth check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Yes, please.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:08]** So Chalk has moved up and to the left about 40, 50 feet?

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Longer than that?

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** 100 feet?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** You were kind of alone and isolated on the top left side of the map.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:20]** Rolu stepped forward and is just near the right side edge of the platform we talked about.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** What was your stealth check, Chalk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** That was 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:33]** I think Broly's going to walk up near Thaddeus and TremÃ© and say, are we really just... Look, we might not all get along, but we can't let Jack stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** Don't assume the worst.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** He's scouting ahead.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Broly, don't put words in my mouth, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** We're watching him.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:47]** I can see his little... I just moved up to make sure he's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:52]** I suppose I should not expect a military approach when dealing with pirates.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** I always forget that.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** You served in the military, Rolu?

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** No, just maybe a more cohesive self.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Yes, we know you're pretentious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** We get it.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** We get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** We get it.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Please continue.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** I did get you all moving.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Let's go support Jack.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:18]** I had already drawn my intent to move to that square long before you got into it.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** We're all to assume stuff.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** I don't know.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** He thinks he's better than you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** He thinks he's better than all of us.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** Can we support Jack and then we can pick up about this later?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:41]** Okay, so you guys start making your way up and around the top of this platform and kind of avoiding actually climbing on top of the big flat plate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:46]** Chuck, go ahead and give me a perception check from where you are.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** 16.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** You're close, but...

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** To that platform where the figure is.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:03]** But since you are so small, you don't quite have the eyeline to see any more of the figure.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:10]** You can kind of see maybe the top of his head, but you can't make out what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Can I hear what he's doing at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** With that perception?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** No.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Okay.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** I'm sorry.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** The rest of you kind of move up and around.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Are you going to move any forward further?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Yes or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Well, Chuck, stay where you're at.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I'm asking the rest of the group.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Are you guys catching up to Chuck or are you staying where you're at?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** Rolo's going to keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** He's going to move 10 feet.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:44]** Torme is going to trail behind the others, but he's basically going to wait until they clear the platform before he makes his way over.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:47]** So he's just sort of like holding up the rear.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:51]** Thaddeus is going to be here where he can see what's going on.

**[00:38:51 - 00:39:02]** So we kind of have like a line spread out across the top of the map effectively where Rolu is about 15 feet from Chak.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** Thaddeus is 10 feet from Rolu.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** I'm 10 feet from Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:14]** And Rolu is about to unwisely, unstealthily enter this open area.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** Of difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:26]** As you guys move up and around this platform, that sense that somebody's watching you comes right back.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Thaddeus, it hits you the worst.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** The hairs on the back of your neck stand up on end.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** All over my...

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Well, looky here.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:47]** A hooky woman in black and gold armor steps forward and turns to Yosuke that's right next to her and says, oh, and the Yosuke looks a little worse.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Hold on, let me finish.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Jeez.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:54]** So that she turns to Yosuke and that Yosuke actually looks a little worse for wear.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Like they survived a flashbang to the face.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Great work, Chask.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Yosuke nods, and two more Hilkies approach.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:12]** One looks tough, but all of them are wearing true warrior armor.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** Okay, one looks tough like it's Michael, or?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:21]** Very similar build to Michael, but definitely not Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** It's not Michael, but they were worked out partners.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** Let's hope he is Michael that way that he can promise that he'll help them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** No, you know better.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** That's definitely not Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Okay, freaking Michael never was here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** So, where is your android friend?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** That's none of your business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** He's on his way.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:46]** He was making a quick pick.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:51]** They were making a quick pick stop with this...

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:55]** This, uh, Tinkerton folk guy who's supposed to show up?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** Uh, boss, I don't like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Shut up!

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** Dotrulu wants that android, and Tez wants them all dead.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Yeah, but those goblins said that the trash god was last seen.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Did you just say trash god?

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Shut up and focus.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Chask, go find that android.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** And the Yosuke nods and then darts off.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** The rest of you.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:24]** And that lieutenant draws out her auto-target rifle and cocks it.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** None of you are going to make it out of here alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:34]** How dare you profane this temple to Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** Go ahead and roll initiative.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Oh, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** There it is.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** Just when you thought that we could get away with just a... Just role-playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** We don't even know who this other guy is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** I know.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Come on.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** It was a good... We had some good conflict.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** It was good.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** It was all going well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:58]** And now I'm worried about this other Yosuke finding Barry now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:09]** I'm low-key hoping this is a Wizard of Oz moment where Tinkerton is just this random schmo just yanking levers and turning wheels and pushing buttons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Oh, man.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** Don't look behind the curtain.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** What if Tinkerton is just a goblin in some kind of armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:20]** What if Tinkerton's this person behind this screen here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** Wait, Kev, what did you say?

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Nothing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Oh, wait.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** What did he say?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** Vinny, what did he say?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** He was saying something about Goblin in armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Because I think that's the spoiler.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** I'm not going there.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** Speaking of spoilers, go ahead and tell us your initiatives, please.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** 12.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** I got 16.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** 12 for Chuck.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** 16 to May.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** 21 for Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** 21 for Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** 22.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** All right, all right, all right.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** What is your bonus, Thaddeus?

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Which bonus is that now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Initiative bonus?

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** I thought it was your dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Whatever.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Close enough.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** It's definitely not high enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:15]** So now we have to worry about this combat, and then we have to worry about Vahri, Merc, and Kesh.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** So this is going to be a...

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:30]** This is an interesting situation here because we're also trying to get to talk to this person behind the curtain quickly enough before something happens to Vahri.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** Do we feel like Merc and Kesh can handle themselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Her name is Merc.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** You didn't exactly ask how that's spelled.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** It's like mercenary.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** It was a joke.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Oh.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** Tiny Goblin is going to be this hardcore mercenary named Merc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** But no one thinks Merc and Cash could handle themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:56]** Let me go ahead and just take the Yosuke off that list because they ran off to find Vari.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Okay.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Bam.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** And it's actually the lieutenant's turn.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** So she's got her auto target rifle.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:09]** She's just going to raise that and in a full round take pop shots at you.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** She's actually going to target Thaddeus.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** So that's a minus four from each roll.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** The first is a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:31]** Starting it off right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:35]** Do you guys want to do a card for that or just call it a miss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** I'll leave that up to you.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** It's a miss plus a card if we do a card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:44]** She's not technically a named character, so it could just be a miss.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Miss it is.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** I'm cool with it.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Y'all cool with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** The next shot is probably also a miss.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** So much for this auto-target being an auto-target rifle.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:56]** So she goes... And she shoots at both of you.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** She shoots at who?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Sorry, she shoots both shots at Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:05]** That's fine for the poorly built characters to die first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:17]** And it's very strange because as she shoots, it's like the echo from her gun is almost reverberating too much, if that makes sense.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** There's a rumble to her gun as it echoes throughout this valley.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:30]** Thaddeus just sees her go like, blah, blah, blah, annoying comment, and then try to shoot him twice.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** And he's like, ha!

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:35]** And then he just dives a little bit and then shoots her right now.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:41]** He's also going to, oh, he can only do, he can't do a full attack with this gun anymore.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** We found out.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** It's a 20 to hit, though.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:50]** And going to roll for damage right now.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** That is definitely a hit.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** That's... God, it's only one damage.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Only one?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** Little dart goes into her neck.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:05]** She just grabs it.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Like a little mosquito bite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Pulls it right out.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Throws it on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** And then he's going to... Nice.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Then he's going to shout to... Well...

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:21]** He's going to look at Shaq and then just, like, kind of, like, make a signal that, like, we've been, like, kind of found out.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** And just, like, motion to him and then just, like, keep pointing to, like, go further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** It's funny because, like, Shaq's too little to see any of this.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Yeah.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** I was lucky waiting for his turn.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** But, like, all he heard, like, he's just sneaking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:41]** And then here's... Yeah, two gunshots and there's, like, echo.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Yeah, it's...

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** That's going to be kind of scary.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Rolu, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:53]** Rolu, I think, follows the track of the Yosuke leaving probably too long.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** And his head lingers and he's thinking, calculating, worried about Merc and Keshenvari.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** Do we have comms connection to them?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** I'm going to say no to that.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** No, we don't.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Okay.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** So there's not a way to get a message to them right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:15]** If you had a comm unit, I think it's like a computer's check or something to establish that connection.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:25]** So if you want to use your term to do that, I'll let you use your move action to pull it out and a radio check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:35]** Brolu is going to waste his turn and pull out a comm unit and he's going to radio to them because he is worried about them being surprised because I don't think they're expecting anything.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** So that's his first immediate action.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** Oh, I might not even be trained in computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Do you have a comm unit?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:55]** So, yeah, I'm not trained in computers, so I have an engineering check, but I don't know if that would need to have been done prior to this.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Maybe when we're there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** I'm sure you established comms with Vari.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Okay.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** But I'm trying to look up the rules on actually using a comm unit.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Sure.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:10]** It is a tier zero computer with no upgrades.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Okay.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** So I'll let you roll computers with a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Which kind of makes sense.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:26]** You're not very good at using this comm unit, and you're probably outside of the range for it anyways, but you're just trying, hitting static probably, but there is a chance you can get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:29]** I don't have computers, so I don't know that.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** Okay, so you're just saying I would do minus four?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** Yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:39]** Yeah, that's a 15 to establish a connection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Go ahead and say what you're going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Vary, you need to be on alert.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** You might be in danger.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** You, Merc, and Kesh need to keep an eye out.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Maybe tell them to hide.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** I can say that telepathically to Rolu.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** Make sure you hide and pull out whatever protection you have.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** Look out for any Ahsokis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** All right.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** That's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** That's a standard, a move, and everything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:16]** Yeah, the standard action would be... I would say the move action is to pull out the comm unit.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Okay.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** And then the standard action is to use the comm unit.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Okay.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** Because this isn't just like your wristwatch.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** You're going a longer distance than that.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Yeah, makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:29]** And feel free to call me out on Discord if that's not the way the comm units work.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** I didn't look up a range on them.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** Anyways, Rolo's turn is over.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** And that rumble returns.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** That's the best rumble noise I can make.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:51]** With that, I'm going to move this piece of junk up to here and set that in the map layer just so it's out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Kev, just wait.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** What happened?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Did Kevin just cheat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** What just happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** He gave them cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Yes, because everything I do is cheating.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Let him explain.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** He was curious.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** Yeah.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** So what happened was that rumble grows louder and louder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** And it shifts some of the junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** It shifts some... No, it didn't shift the junk.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:18]** That sheet of junk went flying off of where it was.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Boom!

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:24]** And it actually smacks into all those warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** I take back the cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** From underneath the junk...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:49]** it's a robot it's it's it's him it's a junk robot it's a tinkerton it's the rumored junk construct there's a junk construct with like a skull head and glowing blue eyes kind of looks like the iron giant a little bit he's kind of cool it's like halfway between iron giant

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** and Ultron 1.0.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** My favorite thing about this is this has not been a secret.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** It is on the cover of Junkers Delight.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:01]** Let me just take you back real quick to our title page, which is directly off of the front of the book.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Does this creature look familiar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Amazing.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Just note the picture a little bit.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Just take that in.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** You see a giant robot in the middle.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:14]** This is the Vesk that left the message.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** There is a Vesk on top of this thing with a Dashko

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Trying to claw it.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** In the background, you can see some Akesh-T.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** In the foreground, you can see some goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Yeah.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:29]** I think the vest on top is one of the iconics.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** That's one of the player characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Three goblins.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Again, no trench coat.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Missed opportunity.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** No trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:40]** You think... I think that vest is iconic to me.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** But in that case, what happened there was this giant...

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** junk creature known as a murder bot, uh, called Tinkerton by the trash hunters.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** It, it flung that sheet of junk, you know, 20 feet.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:02]** And in the process caused a 15 foot wide junk effect, thrown junk.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:06]** Um, so they are going to take two D six of damage.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** The three, uh, true warriors that are there.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:15]** Um, and if they fail their DC save, they will also be pushed 10 feet.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Right to Termay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** Three points and one point.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** That's four points of damage.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** Now I have to roll a check for each of them.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Just pull up their abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:35]** Termay, I think you need to decide how you're going to coup de grace all these enemies.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** Figure out the best way.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Yeah, whips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Wow.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** I was like, man, I got to figure out these reflex saves.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** No, I don't because they all rolled really low.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** They all got hit with full damage and got moved 10 feet.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** They were pushed.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** So let me move them up.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** That one goes there.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** That one goes there.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:02]** So all three true warriors are basically just struck by this sheet of junk metal.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:09]** Looks like a corrugated steel hits them hard, pushes them 10 feet and out behind them is this large.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:13]** And by large, I mean, it takes up 10 foot by 10 foot square junk creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** Yes.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:21]** With that, with that normal Hill key in current and talk of opportunity, because he's moving out of a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:25]** No, you're talking about because it was close enough to... Oh, from the junk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** No, because it's first turn.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Check there.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Dun, dun, dun.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Right.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** The junk monster.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** There's no technology on the first turn, but good call.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Nice.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** You hear that, Jeremy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** I remembered.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Yay!

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** Thanks, Jeremy.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Growing as the podcast.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Did anything happen to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:54]** like sorry besides damage are they staggered or anything like that since this happened they got like no they they just got pushed yeah so they each took four points of damage uh let me edit that on my


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Well, this is going to bode really well for us.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** I am... You say that now.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Yeah.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** I hope so, too, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Anything like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Dude, you know what?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** I'm just trying to appreciate my own optimism here.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** I'm trying to stay optimistic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** We could just be like, praise... Praise Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Triune.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Triune.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:24]** That triggering that was actually the junk... Sorry, the murder bot.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** That was their turn.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** It is now Tremay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Okay.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:45]** Seeing this unfold across from this area, I am going to first try to examine the makeup of our...

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** Tinkerton, trash, God.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Nice.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Vessel.

**[00:54:52 - 00:55:02]** And see what makes it tick and or what's at the helm of this terrifying creature.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** How would I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** What are you going to roll for that?

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Engineering?

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** What do you want to roll for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Okay.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Assess or no?

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Physical science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Engineering.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:16]** I was going to say you can do life science, engineering check or mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** I'll do life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** Cause are you trained in life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:20]** Yeah.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:26]** Cause that's the best I'm trained in versus engineering or what was the other ones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Mysticism or engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** What is my mysticism?

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** I'll do mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Okay.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Okay.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Okay.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** What do you want to know?

**[00:55:42 - 00:56:08]** uh how do i defeat it that's yeah that's so you want to know so many weaknesses uh i'll give you a weakness um is not necessarily weakness uh but they have a magic immunity and that magic immunity um basically they're immune to all magic

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:37]** but certain magics such as acid damage act differently acid attacks will act as a slow spell for three turns no save on that and if the creature is targeted by a spell that uses quote unquote at least one bulk of electronic equipment or junk the creature will become confused for 1d4 rounds


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** I'm seeing this.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:45]** Hey, there's some things about this trash creature we should maybe take note of.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** I don't quite know how to get rid of it yet.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:55]** I don't know if I should be spending energy on these true warriors or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:12]** but uh i did have this queued up anyway so uh i'm guessing that this would count as a 15 foot cone if i were to like hit this this would be the cone correct gm kev oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Uh, yeah, that looks about right.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Yeah.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** I'd say you could hit all three with a 15 foot coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:28]** That's what I'm gonna... I'm going to then pull all the heat from the area and just focus it on these.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** You're in a desert.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** That's a lot of heat.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** It's a lot of heat.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** It's very hot here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** Do you feel that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:42]** True warrior, do you feel the heat coming bearing down on you?

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:46]** It's the heat of your own decisions coming to haunt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** They all get fortitude saves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** We didn't come here for this.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** I don't think they get anything.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Lecture.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** I think they just get.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Think about your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:00]** If you rolled a hit, you either have a roll to hit or they roll a save.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Let me just look at the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Some Shakespearean.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Sorry.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Can you say that again, Kev?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Because I did not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** DC 14 for half.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Reflex save.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** That's a four.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** A five.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** For nine points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:33]** Okay, so you suck in all the hot desert air, dry heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Radiation heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** Blow the flames out of your mouth, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:45]** No, it's sort of like being channeled in front of me through almost like airbending.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:46 - 00:59:09]** firebending firebending it's awesome you you put all four hands together to create a cone shape of flames that hits all three of the true warriors yeah the first true warrior fails and takes nine nine points of damage nice the other two passed so they take four half yeah so four

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Bam.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** And bam.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:16]** That is the end of your turn or I'm going to, I'm going to retreat.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** You're going to run off the map.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:23]** You're on top of junk.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** You're on top of junk.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** So that is difficult to train until you get off of the junk.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** So you're, you know, use twice as much speed on each of those squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Okay.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** So that I can, so this square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:57]** that i'm here in this square so sort of 10 10 feet to move basically half my movement sure nice all right uh with that it is now uh one of the two true warriors the the smaller of the two uh hilkey men um and he he's like brushing off the flames um

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:02]** And then he turns around, he looks at this giant creature that stands over 10 feet tall.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** And he's like, nah, f*** this, man.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** I didn't sign up to fight a murder bot.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I'm out, man.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** And he darts off screen.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Game over!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** Bye-bye.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Chalk, it is now your turn.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** I feel like I'm about as confused as Chalk is.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** Because, like, explosions...

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Fire, giant robot.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** Like, what the heck is going on?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:36]** So here's what I think Chuck wants to do.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:47]** He's going to have a look at this figure behind the aluminum sheet to see if he's also panicking or if he appears to be like, does he look like he's controlling this thing?

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Is this all according to plan?

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** Right.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** That's what I think he's looking to.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Nice, I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** I think this is it.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** We're fighting the dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:09]** I'm going to say, again, just for the listener, this junk creature is down in the bottom right.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:13]** Top right of the map are two true warriors left.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]** One is the lieutenant and one is a tough true warrior.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:23]** Just up and left to them is the three of you, Treme, Thaddeus, and Rolu.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:32]** And then further over to the left is Chak, who is just a couple squares away from this cloaked figure.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Cloak is a loose term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** Shrouded by junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** Shrouded, yeah.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** But there's a bunch of junk in between, so...

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]** I'm going to say if you want to be especially small, if you want to see this creature, I need you to actually move closer.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:50]** I'm going to say you're going to have to get within five feet of this creature in order to see it.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** I'm going to move to there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** Yeah.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** I'm going to move within five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** All right.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** He is calling.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** That's like his calling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** I'll do it.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Do you want to roll me a stealth?

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Sure.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** I'll try to sneak up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** That's a 20 on the die, my dude.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** Nice.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]** So that is 27 for stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:18]** You look at all of them and you're like, you put your hands up and you're like, what the hell?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** And then you just go, okay.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** And you shrug it off.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:27]** And then like all four of your like vines kind of push down on the ground and lift your body up off.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:32]** And you kind of just spider web or spider leg your way around up and over this junk.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:38]** And then like as your tiny body is being raised up and over that last piece of junk, you just see your little head pop up.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:52]** And in the foreground, you see just the shoulders and the head of this large battle-weathered Vesk sitting in a damaged command seat.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** Let me just for a second.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** What's it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]** The guy from the screen, the landing from the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** So it's a Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** The junk bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]** Does anybody want to roll a culture check on this guy?

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:11]** Or do you guys remember any Vesk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Only Chuck sees him now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Only Chuck sees him.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** And it's a 26 for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:22]** And so, you know, for a fact, because you must have saw his picture next to his cot.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** This is Zethelred.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** You guys were in his camp.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Kelly is wearing his armor.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Thaddeus is wearing his armor.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:32]** Awkward.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:34]** Go ahead.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** I just need you real quick to roll me a medicine check, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** No.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** I can't.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** I'm not trained in medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:46]** Well, I think you would know enough, actually.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** Anyways, he's not moving.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Is he dead?

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** And he's most likely dead.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** Oh, no.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** Come on, man.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** That's our game?

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** That is our game now?

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** Kev, we have so much more game to get through.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** I've never had my mind blown so many times.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:10]** And then like, no, we'll see you next week.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Thanks, Kev.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Sorry, I know this is a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:15]** This is a lot to reveal.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** It's big GM energy right here.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:30]** Until next week, drift beegons and distant stars.
