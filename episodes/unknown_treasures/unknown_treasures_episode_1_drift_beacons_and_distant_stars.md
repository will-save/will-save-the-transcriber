## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:00]** All right.

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:03]** Welcome back or welcome in the first place.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:06]** If you've been listening to us for a while, thank you for listening.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:08]** If you're brand new to this, great.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:09]** Welcome.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:11]** My name is Kevin Decker.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:14]** I play the Android Rick 19 in our normal storyline.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:18]** And where you're jumping in right now is not our normal storyline.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:20]** I'm not going to spoil anything for you.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** It's a fun adventure, but it's a side path.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:33]** And what I'm actually here to say, though, is whether you've been listening for the last two books, and there was two books before where we are now, or if you're jumping in for the very first time here, thank you.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:34]** Thank you.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:34]** Thank you.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:35]** First off, thank you.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:37]** Period.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:39]** But now I want to invite you over to our Discord.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:42]** We have discord.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** It'll take you to our Discord.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** It's a communication device.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** You can get to know us and our other fans.

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:50]** We have a great community on there.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:52]** Do we even have an album of the week club?

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:53]** I highly recommend that.

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:57]** I know nothing about music, and it's a fun place to learn new things, and it has nothing to do with the show.

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:01]** Anyways, back to what I was saying, discord.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:02]** That's a way for you to communicate with us.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** But...

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** There are other things that I'm here to beg you for.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** Not really, I'm not gonna beg.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** We need your support.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** In order to keep this show running, we need Monetary Foundation.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** For that, we have a service that we go through called Ko-fi.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:24]** Ko-fi.com is a great system that allows fans to support creators, and we're on there.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:29]** So you can actually get a shortcut to get there, coffee.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Again, that's coffee.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** And don't really worry about spelling for that one.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** But there you can join one of our tiers.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:40]** It's a monthly subscription and you will get perks for that.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** You can do a write-in sentence.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:47]** This is one of the creative ideas that we have to get you to interact with our show on the air.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:53]** We would take a sentence that you write and we have to work it into our character's

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** dialogue somewhere in the show.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** And it's a surprise to all of us when it comes out.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** It's been a lot of fun.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** Thank you to our fans that do support us with that and have submitted.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** And if you haven't yet, great.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:07]** There's an opportunity for you to have your input on our show.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Another thing I want to talk about is our merchandise.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** We have shop.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** There you can buy t-shirts, hats.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** I

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** I'm not even sure there's swims, swim trunks.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** There's all sorts of things on there.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** We have a very creative team that puts together that stuff.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** Uh, and you can wear it around and look cool.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** There's nothing else to say there, right?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** You just look cool.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Sporting our stuff, which is awesome.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Yes.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** Again, Kevin Decker, thank you so much for listening.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Thank you for supporting us.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:40]** If you have any questions, you can go to discord.willsavethepodcast.com, join our Discord, and ask us.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** We'll answer.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Believe me.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** You can even add us on there.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** I think that's how it works.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I'm usually the Kevster101.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** I think I'm on there as Kevin.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Get on Discord.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Talk to us.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** But most of all, please keep listening and enjoying our show.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** And thank you, thank you, thank you again.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** Now back to your regularly scheduled program.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:05]** This is We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology, Unknown Treasures.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:32]** All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to we'll save the pot.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** Wait, wait, wait a minute.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:37]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** What's going on?

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Wait, what is this?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Why is Kevin talking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Why did you start?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Yeah, no, this is this is Kevin.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** Kevin, this is John's podcast.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:47]** Yeah.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Where are we?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** This is what we're going to call a little side session of We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:01]** We're calling it We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:11]** I think this is going to be an overwhelming, overarching story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** It's already overwhelming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** It's great.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** It's still connected.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** This is still within the universe of

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** We'll save.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** The rest of the podcast.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** But I will be GMing this one.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** And I just want to... This is another note, especially for the listener.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** I'm sorry ahead of time.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:37]** I have never ever GMed a game in my life.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** This is a first for me.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** It's going to be awesome.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** We didn't even run like a test session.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** This is true.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** I'm jumping into this while recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** We don't need to.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** I'm so excited for Kevin to run this game.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Me too.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** I'm so excited.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** I'm so nervous.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** It's so good.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** It's so great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Now you will know.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** It's going to be awesome.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Yeah.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:02]** And I love that the only person on this podcast nervous is Kevin.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Yeah.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** That was great.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** That's great.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:21]** But don't, but for, for real, don't ask people in their thirties to help you move.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** Like they'd rather probably donate money to help you hire somebody.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** I'll help you hire somebody.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:32]** I'm 35, almost 36, and I'll help people move all the time.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** But I'd rather offer than be asked, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** I would help anyone move any one or two pieces of furniture.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:43]** But my brother, bless his heart, lived in a third floor walk-up.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** No.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** No, I'm not doing that.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** No, dude.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** We're of that age.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Hire some movers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:53]** My sister, I once helped her move in the same apartment complex four times.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** I'm not even kidding.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** She'd be like, I want to move up a floor or this way or something like that.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** The last time I moved, I just bolted everything to the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:08]** And you bought out all the tools in the local hardware.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** So she could never take them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** I cut off all the roads.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** There's no way in anymore.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** But my name is Kelly.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** And I don't know, man.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** I didn't help her move last time.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:42]** uh so um my name is kelly and uh i live in los angeles and um yeah that's right i i came here to this group of people because i knew will and worked with will and i love everyone here and love working with them it's awesome and my favorite oh i love you and uh i'm sure that my character is going to have a nice happy healthy life under kevin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:47]** Man, my favorite letter is X. Won't die in the first episode, we hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** That's a bold prediction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:55]** Some of the most interesting words can be formed with an X. What's our over-under on somebody dying in the first episode?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Please.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Or second episode.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Any character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** I mean, somebody has to die, right?

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** I mean, look, I gotta bring it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** It's my first time GMing and I don't know what CR means, so good luck.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:38]** who do you play on we'll save the podcast oh on we'll save the podcast i play uh sharon former space pirate called here's fabricius he is a bug guy yeah fabricius it's a cool cool so i think we got everybody i think everyone we have any other questions any comments we want to make or do you guys want to move ahead i'm i'm anxious i'm i'm shaky i want to get started


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Okay, just tell me which page of the book you want to start on.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** I'll turn to it, and we'll go from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Hold on, let me see.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** I'll open up the book.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Okay.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** It is actually page three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** If we could all open our books of The Adventure Path, that would be great.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** It sounds like we're in church.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:20]** open your books yeah none of you should what about classroom open your books to page oh that too yeah this is this is where kev teaches us all about the navy yeah that's actually another idea it's a giant excuse to like talk about the navy he's like we're gonna we're gonna do pirates that's what just because that's why i picked that's why i picked it uh sure no okay i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Man, I've learned more about the Navy.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** I have family in the Navy.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** A lot of family.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** I've learned more about it from Kevin than anyone else.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** It's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** It's because I'm a digget and I love it.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** I love the Navy.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** I don't even know what that is.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** It's a tool.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** It's a Pokemon.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** I'll teach you.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Now that you don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** It sounds like I should stop this peaceful, wonderful, lighthearted banter music since I'm running the music.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Sounds like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:58]** i think you should hold up just a minute john's gming already yeah i know his podcast it's not even i'm sorry i'm sorry let's see if i can try this right ready all right here we go oh

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** All right, let's play.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Hey, cool.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** The lights go down in the theater, right?

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** And stop dimming.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:16]** So I want you to close your eyes and picture the vast darkness speckled with stars.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:23]** And you see in blue text long ago in this very galaxy ellipses.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** Now you can play a dramatic music, John.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:34]** And yellow words will fly back into space as we'll save.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:40]** And the interstellar tales from the extra galactic adventure anthology flies onto the screen.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** And then yellow words start to crawl up the screen.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:51]** Junkers delight by Jason Keeley and Misha Bush.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** And it's slightly bigger, bold font, unknown treasures.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** and in normal font follows.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:14]** Only a few years after the gap, the god Shri Yun sent the signal, a message that civilizations across the galaxy how to access the drift, a strange new plane of existence that facilitates faster-than-light travel.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:23]** At once, scientists and scholars sought to better understand the drift, what it was, how it truly worked, and why it existed.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** Centuries later, many of these questions remain unanswered.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:34]** But in those early decades, the pioneering spirit of scientific exploration swept many scientists and research teams up and away.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:46]** One collection of independent scholars believed they could draw energy directly from the drift in a process that would make power sources like batteries obsolete.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:51]** These scientists crewed a research vessel called the Stellar Flare.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:57]** Its mobility allowed them to travel and study unusual drift phenomena.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** And aboard this ship, one of the researchers was an android named Vari-8.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:08]** Tragedy struck the Stellar Edge flare.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:18]** As they conducted an experiment above Akiton after procuring some Thastoron, a mineral often converted into starship fuel before drift engines became a standard.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** The ship crashed on the red planet below.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:30]** Although no one survived and the research was lost, emergency medical teams salvaged the partial remains of VARI-8's body.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:36]** And soon after, another soul found its way into the android, and VARI-9 was born.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Hundreds of years has passed.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** Recently, VARI-13...

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:53]** A historian residing in the body of VARI-8 had a close call with an unsecured airlock and the near-death experience unlocked some of VARI-8's memories.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:00]** Suddenly reminded of the groundbreaking research pioneered by VARI-8, VARI-13 began to track down the stellar flare.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:08]** After all, if any technology from the experiments could be recovered, the research could start again.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:14]** And perhaps this time, all the packed worlds would have limitless energy directly from the drift.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Ellipses.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** All right.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:25]** And then as those words are scrolling up the screen, the spaceship just breaks through them.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Vinny, do you want to describe that ship to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Yeah.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:54]** That ship, uh, looks a bit like a bird in that it's got a sort of a thicker center section, uh, with a cockpit near the front, um, and wings off to the left and right with, um, uh, not feathers, but because they're metallic.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:02]** Um, it looks, it looks a fair bit like the M class ships from a franchise, which I will not name for copyright reasons.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Um,

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:30]** and um the color scheme is navy blue as the primary with like a light um light orange uh alternate and uh oh do you want me to to to mention the name i was gonna ask that yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:53]** um it's caduceus caduceus we're gonna have you spell it out for us some more time but i will um great i think one little change i want to make to that is instead of a cockpit it's actually a full bridge because we're gonna we're gonna scale this thing up it is it is a full size starship with a crew of 50 plus people

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:12]** dang los angeles class and along the side of these things this ship is a bunch of portholes and viewing ports um so we're gonna like swing the camera all the way around this starship and as it wraps around that second time it's going to zoom in on a single porthole

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:26]** And as it zooms in, it's going to see this window and inside this window, there's a small stateroom with a bed on one wall and a beautiful starscape painting hanging over it.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:36]** And across from it is a small desk and sitting at that desk, there's a figure and we're going to zoom in as we get closer.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** And into that, we're going to look past through the window.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** John, can you describe this figure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:50]** So you see this very tall, lean Kasathan.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** You can tell from the back of the elongated head.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:05]** You pan down, you see that there's a black loose fitting shirt, kind of flowy, a little bit of like a quarter button on the front as you pan around.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** And as we look, the shirt comes down to the forearms.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** And if you don't know, Kasathans have four arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Four arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Four arms.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:24]** And you can see all these tattoos, at least from the forearms of the forearms.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** And they seem to be moving up into full sleeves.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Maybe one is a half sleeve.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** There are all these...

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:36]** Tattoos in black ink on this blue skin.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** It looks like some of them are coordinates.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** Some of them are stars.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Some of them are navigational tools.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** There's also one that is the Adari.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:52]** that's quite large on one of the arms and they're sitting looking.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:59]** And as we kind of move around, you see that their pants red, they're like a tunic or sorry, sorry.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** They're, they're robed also flowy.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:14]** There seems to be this gold sash around the pants and they're sitting and it seems like they're leaning forward and the energy is out of them.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** Um,

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** There's a sense of heaviness in the room.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:24]** Maybe if you look off to the right, there's the starscape, this beautiful starscape.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:29]** But down below on the floor, there's several other paintings of various sizes.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** The canvas is just leaning up against each other.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** One maybe is really colorful.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Maybe it's the drift.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** One is almost all black.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** One seems to have some paintings on it.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** You can't quite see it.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** There's some paint supplies sitting next to it.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:48]** But otherwise, the room, except for that, the room is spotless and minimalist, but in a thoughtful way.

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:13]** And as we come around, we see that his eyes are closed, thinking there's a... And without opening the eyes, one of the arms pulls out a drawer in the desk, comes out, picks up a little...

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:40]** that seems to be some sort of storage device and puts it on the ground or on the desk, presses a button, this little hollow display, scrolls through very slowly and his finger pauses above one entry and takes a deep breath.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** One of the arms pushes the entry for the audio to start playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** Listen, Bolu, it's me.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Listen, you did good.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** You did good with the plans.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** The entry points were accurate.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:02]** We got through and we got those people out and even took out some of the traffickers.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** The people are on their way to the rendezvous point and I confirmed that the stewards are there to pick them up.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:12]** So what I'm about to say has nothing to do with you.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** You did perfectly.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** But we got found out.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:21]** And Rulu... Chad... He didn't make it.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:27]** He sacrificed himself so we could get those people out, and so we would have a chance.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** He always was a kind idiot.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** Everyone else is fine, but I don't know what they're gonna do with us.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** Disband the crew.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** A lot of them are pretty much nameless, so they'll be fine.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** Tell them to find other crews, or even better, get away from the free captains far away.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:51]** As for you, Shara, and anyone well-known...

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** We were traitors, and you all had nothing to do with this.

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:01]** Your captain's gone now, and you never had the confidence to become captain yourself, so you disbanded the crew, okay?

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** That's your story, and everyone's story.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** Stick to it.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:17]** My record with the stewards and the other powers that be is now wiped clean, but I've run up a tab with these bastards, and they're powerful ones, so I'm not going to be able to come back from this.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Take care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** The audio stops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:33]** Oh my God.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Sorry.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** I'm the GM and I'm like, what the hell?

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** No, that was beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** Rolu opens his eyes and...

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:46]** We can't quite see his entire face, but another arm presses another button.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:54]** And then as we pan down, we see a white mask going over Rolla's face.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:58]** Leans back, kind of with a heavy sigh.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:06]** Starts to think, starts to just project himself into what could happen.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Having listened to this over and over again,

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** And then stops, remembers where he is.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** And that's what we see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** And he goes back to painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:28]** And he goes back, he takes the storage device, reaches over, grabs a canvas, has a nice little display on the front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:36]** And then while Rolo's going about his business, heavy-handed, there's a...

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Just kind of over the intercom.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** It's called a 1MC on a submarine, but here it's going to be called an intercom or a PA.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Starts now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** I'm starting to... I'm going to take a tally.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** That's tally one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** It's fine.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:53]** Count the Navy references per episode and win a prize.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** One.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** It's like a radar blip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** Cop, let's come to the Seattle State Room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:19]** so as rolu he stands up he opens up the door to the stateroom changes steps out yeah he changes real quick okay he changes and he gets up and he as he's leaving the stateroom another door like right next door in the hallway opens up and what steps out kelly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:31]** Okay, so what steps out of this room is a seven foot tall giant cat beast man called a Patra.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** He's a race and star finder.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:44]** He is golden, kind of like a tabby colored, like golden fur, like all the way, like tall, angular, like horny looking ears.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** And like these like really, really like meow.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** You said horny.

**[00:27:51 - 00:28:03]** Yeah, he has these golden, kind of like a light golden eyes, kind of like a sunrise over the water sort of appearance.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:11]** Behind him as he comes out of the room, you see little tankards and containers filled with...

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:18]** Pieces of biology of various creatures, a couple skulls, trophies from previous engagements.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** This one's a fighter, and so he teaks trophies from those who he destroys.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** His armor is also gold.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Kind of shiny.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** Just a very big, broad, scary-looking guy.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:41]** And on his belt, he has just a sheath, like a black sheath.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Or I should say a hilt, more accurately.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Like hanging on his... There you go.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Big hands, long claws.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:54]** You can make out the traces of dried blood under his fingernails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** Rolu speaks up when he sees Miss Patra.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** Learn anything new from your precious carcass?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I always do, Cobb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** And with that, you two, the WEPS, which is short for weapons officer.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Thaddeus is our weapons officer.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:23]** And the COB, which is an acronym for chief of the boat.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** They're keeping count.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** They're throwing up tally marks.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** Is the most senior enlisted person on a ship.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** The two of you make your way down to the CO stateroom.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:40]** once you get to the door, uh, Rolo, you're going to lead in the way and you reach up and you knock twice.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:46]** I don't, do you knock twice with one hand or do you use like two fists on one side and go to do depends on what I'm feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:50]** But right now there's just not twice with one hand.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** It's very direct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:58]** Uh, and you request permission to enter from the, from the other side of the room or the other side of the door.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** You hear a come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:07]** And so you reach down, you open the handle, you open that door, and Will, what do we see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:25]** You see, as you open the door, the air shifts in a cold room, adorned with trophies from prior journeys, maps and charts, pictures and persons, figures and artifacts, notes scrawling, interpreting a maze of information laid out among...

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:32]** The CO's personal belongings were beneath streams of light beaming from the portholes lining the sides of the stateroom.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:48]** Backlights, a figure barely visible but for two shimmering golden tips of what at first glance looks like knives pointed upward and beneath the large figure whose body heat is producing a thin ribbon of steam creeping up from his body.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:54]** As the creature exhales loudly, a cloud of steam begins to stand.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:15]** What was appearing to be golden daggers you saw before shows themselves to be part of a larger set of black horns curving upward in an appearance of glass resembling a highly polished obsidian streaked with gold and tipped completely by a luminous and shimmering gold horn appearing to be natural but like black marble.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** So sharp it seems to be...

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** gilded.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:26]** Beneath those horns, a long, large face covered in light gray fur.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:42]** He looks up at you with piercing pink eyes, nearly eight feet hulking before you stands, a noir wearing black fitted armor with golden embellishments and a golden collar shrouding his scars around his neck.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Do you want me to name him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Yeah, tell us his name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** His name is Almanzo Goldhorn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Nice.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Almanzo Goldhorn.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Let me write that down.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** I'm not taking notes from the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** I have a problem that you two better handle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:10]** And as the captain says this, there's something moving in the back of his stateroom.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** And it hops down and starts walking down.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** What do we see, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:24]** Um, I, I sort of imagined that the camera pans left to nothing and then tilts down abruptly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:28]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:34]** You see a roughly 18 inch, uh, what might be best described as a monkey faced orchid.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:43]** Um, you see a tiny, um, what looks like Jack from a very popular pirate franchise.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Um,

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:56]** full sort of pirate garbed second skin armor doting around where you would expect to see a bed.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** You would see like a plant bed.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** Instead of sheets, there's like soil.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** It's just a pot, yeah.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:17]** And he sort of toddles over flower gently billowing in the breeze of

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** The ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Nice.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Do you have a name for this creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:26]** His name is Jack, spelled with a C-H.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** So Jack.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:40]** So Jack comes out from his bed, his flower bed, and he moves across the floor and he's going to climb up the leg and onto the shoulder of the pirate captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Captain, what appears to be the problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** Those street rats just bit off more than they can chew.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:50]** Kefak Depot is my territory.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Take the yeoman chief with you.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** He has more details.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** Chalk, go with them.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** That's our territory.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** And as he says that, the ship lurches.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** The whole thing pulls to one side.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:10]** But no one is surprised by that.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** It's almost like it was expected.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** And then the captain states the obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** We're out of the drift now.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** That is all.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:19]** Distant stars.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** Drift beacons and distant stars.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** Drift beacons and distant stars?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** You heard it.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Drift beacons and distant stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** And with that, the three of you leave the room.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:38]** Do you guys say anything to each other as soon as that door shuts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:42]** Look, this is going to be something that sounds like we need to handle this quickly.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Handle this with...

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Not a lot of care.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** We'll take it.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:56]** I'm going to be the CO, and uses air quotes, looking at the Patra.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Which, by the way, what's the Patra's name again?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** The Patra's name is Thaddeus.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** Does that make sense, Thaddeus?

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** If we run into any combat, I have to take over, Cobb.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** You know how this is.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** I can't say you're the man for that job.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** As soon as action occurs, I'm in charge.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** I am the weapons officer, Cobb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** Well, the thing is, you know, things happen in combat.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** So when the time comes, it will get done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Where are you guys?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** It looks like he's watching a tennis match.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:44 - 00:36:05]** uh as as that conversation concludes he climbs up on cop's shoulder all right guys let's go agree to get this done there's like a handout to shake thaddeus just starts walking oh all right damn um okay so where do you guys where do you guys want to go where do you go next


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** Well, we need to go to the yeoman, right?

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Sorry, yeoman.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Yeoman, yeah.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Yeoman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Oh, man, look at John bringing in some Navy terms.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Does that count?

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** That's four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Four.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Yeah.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** I learned it from you, Kev.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Does that count against Kev's count?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** I think we should cap him.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** Thaddeus, are you coming with us to talk to the yeoman?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** Maybe you don't care about that, so I'll just handle it.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** I'm with you, Cobb.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** I'm with you.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** All right.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** So where do you guys head?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** I can give you some suggestions.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** You can go to like Cruise Mess, which is usually where people gather when they're not doing anything else.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** You can go to the engine room.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** You can go to one of the cargo bays.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** You can go to like the cargo bay or you can go to the other cargo bay.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** Oh, there's two.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Are we sure?

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:19]** yeah this time yes there are two this time yes there's not a third one that we're not aware of right i'm sorry maybe all right if there's two there's one so you could also go to the chief's quarters which is where the chiefs usually hang out or like the yeoman shack is where yeomans usually go so where would you guys want to go to first i think probably yeah probably wherever the yeoman is most likely to be so is that one or is that two navy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** That's seven, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** That's like seven.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** Yeoman Shack, I think.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Yeoman Shack?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** All right.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** So you guys make it down.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** You go down the hallway.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** You go down some stairs.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** On your way to the Yeoman Shack, you pass through Cruise Quarters or Cruise Mess.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** Cruise Mess is just like a bunch of dining tables, and there's people hanging out.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Some people are playing cards in the corner.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Other people are just reading a book.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** And you go further down that hallway.

**[00:37:44 - 00:38:11]** off to the side there's it seems like a stateroom except for the top of the door there's like it's a split door so one door can swing open like the top of the door opens and you look in there and there's a young Lashinta sitting there real quiet your move Cobb you're in charge excuse me have you seen the yeoman


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:15]** No, no, I haven't seen it.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Last I saw the Chief, I think he's in Chief's Quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** All right, thank you, as you were.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** And we leave to go to the Chief's Quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Cool.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** So you guys walk further down and you get to the chief's quarters.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** You knock on the door and you're the cops.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** You can just kind of, you know, go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:44]** And, uh, you see a round table and there's, uh, a vest sitting on one corner and sitting next to him is who, who was sitting next to the vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:53]** Well, you see the yeoman, Treme, Theoden, Hermidex, uh,

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:22]** also known as Treme, a hooded figure with a burnt orange sort of, uh, gold and pink hued, uh, embellishment with a cape, uh, and a, he's a witch word, four armed wearing sort of black obsidian, uh, freebooter armor, similar to what the captain's garb, uh, was, but with a, uh,

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:30]** Sort of like a pink, rose pink, golden hue to the trim around it.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** And a burnt orange, almost black embellishment around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** Sitting there discussing, I guess, something with the vest.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:47]** Would I know if the Vesk is a lower rank than me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** You would know that he's at least a chief.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** And more Navy shit.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:55]** So if the chiefs are just sitting there casually, they're probably both chiefs.

**[00:39:55 - 00:40:01]** If there's somebody standing there, he's probably talking to a chief like he was requested to come in.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** But it'd be much more formal and rigid.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** So if they're just casually talking, they're probably both chiefs.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** At least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** And chief would be higher than cop, correct?

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:33]** tech no cob cob is chief of the boat he's the highest chief he's the highest chief the highest all right uh gonna walk over and look in and look over at the yeoman say yeoman i'm gonna need you for something uh and then look at the desk and say if you don't mind we're gonna need the room for this i'd like to speak in private very well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** And the Vesk stands up.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:39]** He just kind of nods at you and shimmies out because their Vesks are large.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yeah.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** Kind of pushes people out of the way.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** He bows at Thaddeus.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:53]** And his eyes kind of get big when he sees Chek because Chek is usually only on the captain's shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** Yeah.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** You better get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** And with that, he huffs and keeps walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** I think...

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:14]** I think Rolu goes and takes a seat and then looks over at Thaddeus, gestures a seat for Thaddeus and said, Can I help you?

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** We've got something here from the captain.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Sounds like you've got some more information.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:26]** We just dropped out of the drift and we need to take back Kefak Depot.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Yes.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** Tell me everything you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** We are to go on a mission.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** The shuttle is ready.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** The talking bay.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** We must eliminate Dotrulu.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** Trulo.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Eliminate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Dotrulu is how I pronounce it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Dotrulu.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:50]** Find some information, some riddle to draw and draw him out.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** This is what I've been told.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** You've been told to draw him out.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Dotrulo, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:11]** Okay, so... We must leave at once, and I've been given the authority to accompany you on this mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:16]** I am happy to have you aboard on this mission.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** I just want to find out more.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:24]** So, Detrulo is somebody... What's their thing?

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** What's their shtick?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** Why are they a thorn in our side right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** Oh, okay.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** I don't know.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Yeah, I'm going to tell you.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** This is all you guys know.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:42]** Is that Torme... That's how you say it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Yeah, Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Torme has a note.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** Do you want to show him the note?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** Go ahead and show... I don't know if that's what your character would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Sure, yeah.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** I'll show him the note.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** It says, Eliminate Dotrulu.

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** Find the riddle.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Dotrulu.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Find the riddle.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** draw him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** As Treme told you, there is a shuttle waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:18]** I think Rolo's going to show that to Thaddeus and say, how many riddles do you find on those corpses?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** This is something new here.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** I'm not in the business to solve riddles, but I guess that's what we're doing now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:32]** I've found many things on corpses, but never a riddle before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:32 - 00:44:00]** looking forward to it i love a riddle check i'll be looking to you the most for the answer to this riddle all right shall we proceed and i think uh i think rolu like kind of side eyes tornado and then this yes yes we shall as like a reminder of like oh yeah that's right we gotta get back to the job

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** And then we slams all four arms or hands on the desk.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:11]** So I figure you guys all get up, you kind of just shoot your different ways and grab your gear, you know, whatever gear you're expecting to bring on this.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:16]** Um, and then you head out to the docking bay and you guys all meet up in the docking bay.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** And there's like, there's several ships in this docking bay.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** It's a large starship.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** And so there's several smaller ships and shuttles.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:29]** Um, so you guys walk up to one and it's about the size of like a small helicopter, like a military helicopter.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** It probably seats about, you know, eight people total.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Um,

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:57]** yeah like a huey i don't know how many people i didn't look up how much you can hold because that is navy related but it's air stuff it's not it's not part of the navy so it doesn't care submarine anyway so you guys walk up to this one shuttle that is clearly the one that's activated and getting ready to go um you guys all start to climb in there's a young human woman um

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** Sitting in the pilot seat and she goes Cobb weps.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Welcome aboard says here.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** You guys are going to Catholic Depot Yeah, we're going to Keflak Depot

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:18]** And with that, she starts flicking switches and pushing buttons, and the engines roar to life, and you guys all get in, shut the doors, and you hear this as the doors seal shut.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Yes.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:28]** And then the airlock doors, the giant bay doors open up, and you see the stars out, and you can see Akiton down below you.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:33]** And the shuttle starts to lift off and shoot out the bay doors.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** And that's when you hear, you know, now we're, like, in the intercoms, and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:41]** Just so you know, there's no fly zone around Kefauk Depot.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** Nothing can fly there, like not even insects and bugs and birds.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Morrow's as close as I can get you, Rolu.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:52]** But the XO said he's got some ground support for you, some ground transport ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** That's fine.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Drop us wherever's safe.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** And also wherever's quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Want to keep this a little under the radar.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** I'm not sure if that suits you.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** That's not really how it works, John.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Just saying.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** So I'm switching you over to the map of Akitan now.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Yes, Roll20.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Yeah.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Shout out to Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** It's just a map of Akiton, which is a beautiful map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** I want to shout out Kev for this really good landing page for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Yes.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Thank you.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Great, great landing page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** I drew it myself.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** I took the cover of the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Joker's Delight.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Shout out.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** I had to look it up who drew that, but thank you very much.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Cool.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** So now you guys should be on the right map.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Yes.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** On the right map.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Yep.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** I see it.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** I see a map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** You don't see the map?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** I see a map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Oh, you see the map.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Okay, cool.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** So now I'm going to do, let's see if I can do this right.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Bam!

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Did that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** What am I seeing now?

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Oh, yeah, I see the ship.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:10]** If anybody knows the map of Bakutan, anybody listening, there's a map of Bakutan, and across the middle of it is a big, large crack.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:19]** As the scout ship breaks through the dusty atmosphere of Akiton, you see a humongous crevice splitting the small planet, small desert planet.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:31]** This chasm that runs almost the entire equator is called the Adio Drift.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:40]** You see a major metropolitan area built into the walls of this canyon as far as the eye can see.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** All the way down to the bottom.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** And there's no rock there.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:50]** Only buildings and flickering lights all the way into the darkness from the cliff's edge blocking the sunlight.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:57]** The ship settles onto one of dozens of landing pads on the upper ridge as the city spills over into the flat desert.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:05]** It lands on this pad and you step out and you walk over to a parking lot and kind of lead the way.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:10]** And Torme is kind of leading the way because he's got the information that the pilot handed him.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:15]** And there's this giant elevator that comes up.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** This way.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:21]** And where the elevator is coming up and other people are moving around, you actually see a bus.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:30]** But instead of like a school bus almost, but instead of wheels, it has like tank treads all the way down the side of it.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** And on top, there's some armaments on the roof.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:39]** But if you look closely, they look pretty rusty and probably not well maintained.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** You guys walk up to it and this is your ride.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Hey, uh, Joven?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Where are we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** We are to take this transport.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** That's why we're at the Adayo Rift.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** What do you mean?

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Where are we?

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** We're on Akaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** Oh, okay.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** These buses look pretty broken down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:13]** And as you guys are having this conversation, you're looking at the multiple buses.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:18]** You see one bus that has kind of like a digital sign on the side that says Kefok Depot.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** And there's a Shirin standing outside wearing like a bus driver's outfit.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** I'm not sure what a bus driver's outfit looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** On the city of Mara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Look, guys, they sent one just for us.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** All right.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Anybody going to Catfock Depot?

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Catfock Depot this way.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** We are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** We are.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Check.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:38]** Check.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** I'm just going to need you to.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:46]** Your enthusiasm is infectious, but it just, you know, we don't need to let everybody know that we're going to Catfock Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Shut up.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** Check waves his flower, but not quite as aggressively as he was before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:56]** As you guys walk up, you hand, you know, you hand the tickets to me.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** I probably hands like all the tickets to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Yes, I keep the tickets.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** So we for joining this.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Ride to California Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Welcome aboard.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** I'll get you there as soon as I can.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:12]** And so you guys all shove your way into this bus.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:17]** When you get on, you notice there's a small family of Yosuke.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:22]** And you also see in the very back, there are two Vesks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Chilling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Sitting in the back row.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** You know, wherever you guys want to sit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:32]** I immediately pull out my club and start beating the Yusuke family because they're a threat.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** They're an absolute threat.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:55]** As Rolu gets on, Rolu, in what you can tell is the best way because Kasathans wear masks always, but you can tell that his eyes kind of crinkle up in a smile and he greets the Yusuke family in Yusuke walking by, shuffling by to get to the seat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:03]** The kids kind of turn away from you, but the mother nods and replies back in Yusoki.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Have a nice day.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Check waves aggressively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** The kids smile at you, but they don't know what they're smiling about.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** What is that thing?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:17]** So wait, did we talk about what your races are?

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** I think Thaddeus mentioned you are a Pacha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:30]** rolu we know is a kasafin yep blue skin long uh elongated head wears a mask all the time what was

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** He's a witch word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** A witch word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Such a good choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** And witch words also have forearms, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Correct.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Yeah.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Got it.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** And they are also typically they hide their faces.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** So he's got a hood.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Yeah.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** And then Chuck, what kind of creature are you?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Yeah.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** I described him a bit, but I didn't name the race.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** He's a Raxalite.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Raxalite.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Classic.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** I love Raxalites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** And I feel like on Akiton, a lot of people haven't seen Raxalites.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** They come from a distant planet.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Probably, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:04]** I would imagine there are a lot of plant people on a desert planet.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** Yeah, it's just a wasteland, pretty much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Well, I wouldn't say that.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** Yes, there's more to Akiton than just being a wasteland.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:19]** But, you know, when you see everything with a study of corpses, that's fine.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** To be expected.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:45]** before you guys even sit down uh the shearing steps on board and he shuts the door behind you and he says everyone aboard please take your seats we're gonna get moving soon check please please sit down let's go you need to actually sit and not not hop between the seats he he hops off of the shoulder and like bounces a couple of times on the seat check i'm gonna need you to be in the seat for this ride i'm sorry okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** Thaddeus steps on and then the bus just kind of heaves under his weight.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:58]** And then he just kind of attempts to give a grin at the Yosuke, but it's just terrifying.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** And then he just sits down.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** The kid's like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:07]** So then the bus starts moving as soon as you guys sit down.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:11]** It takes several hours for you to get to Kefauk Depot.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Oh, man.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:16]** If you can see on the map, I was going to actually, sorry, I forgot to watch.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Oh!

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** Look at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** And then Kefauk Depot, you can see how far Kefauk Depot is.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** So it's several hours trip.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** You don't see the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:35]** I just see lots of sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** There's a couple other ridges, but there's bridges across that.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** A couple other ridges, but there are bridges.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** You're trucking through the desert and it takes some time.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** Do you guys do anything while you're on the bus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** I look up what the ambient temperature of the desert is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** It is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:12]** 23 degrees celsius currently okay check check pulls out one of those uh tourist misting fans and just like starts to spray water on himself it's 23 a lot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** 23 is pretty hot in Celsius, is my understanding.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** None of us... No, it's 73 degrees.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Really?

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** What?

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Okay.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** I was super wrong about that, my bad.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** That's nice.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** But it's very early in the morning.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** You guys flew down at sunrise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** I imagine ambient humidity is pretty low.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Yeah.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** It's a dry 73.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** You're like in Arizona.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:47]** Torme is looking out at the landscape, wishing he was outside, but you couldn't tell based on his appearance or face.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** He just gazes by himself, looking outward.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Which words?

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** Do you prefer a dry climate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Huh.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:00]** Torme, you ever been out here in the rough deserts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** I've been in many a desert.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Quite fond of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** So you're a desert guy.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** I'm fond of where opportunity leads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:24]** You know, some may say that there's wisdom in the way that the sands move, and if you listen close enough, you can hear that wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Always so sentimental, Cobb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** Jack presses his ear opening to the window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** I feel like the kids laugh at that.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** I don't hear any wisdom.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** You just have to listen closer, Jack.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** When you get out, you'll be able to hear it all.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** You should just get outside right now, Jack.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** You can get on my shoulder and you can listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** Okay.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** Cool.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:08]** So, you know, this trip goes on for several hours and as it comes near to the end, the vehicle starts speeding towards a growing glare of tall structures.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:14]** Grand buildings, impossibly clean considering the fine grit choking the air.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** A ring on the outer edge of Cothock Depot.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:22]** Flashy signs for accommodations and entertainment adorn every surface.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** As your driver, Chak Tramay, drives deeper into town.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:33]** Glossy facades quickly fade into huddles of dust-stained buildings.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** Mountains of crashed starships and other junk stretch behind them.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:44]** Piles of metal, glass, plastic, and countless other materials glint in the light of the burning sun

**[00:56:44 - 00:57:04]** kafok depot appears quite busy many wheeled vehicles trundle through the streets some of them some of which wind through the junk mounds vendors hawk their wares on every corner and haggle with their customers now let me move you over to the map to another map


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:31]** three maps in one episode what is this kind of show maps on maps dude come to oh look at this map look at the theme oh it's all good it's all it's all nice i like it it looks like a giant junkyard i don't know the the depot in individual letters is a nice touch it's it's it's it's yeah it's it's really cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** I put this map together myself.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Dude, that is so awesome.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** I'm kidding.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** No, everything I did, I downloaded straight from Roll20 from the paid Starfinder pack.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** Thank you, Paizo, for putting this together for me.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:47]** I'm a first-time GM, and I didn't do any of this by myself.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** But you guys can see the bus down in the corner as I wiggle it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Oh, yeah, the red bus.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Gotta scroll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Oh, yeah, the red bus.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I didn't add guns to the top, but there are guns on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Just huge guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:06]** and so it drives into town and, uh, Chuck Tremay starts to get a little bit, uh, talkative.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:09]** And he's like, if you look off to the right, there's the illusion.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** It's a, a famous magicians theater.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:15]** Uh, it's popular all across packed worlds.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** And he drive further and he's like that, that place belongs to the water dealer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Uh,

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** Water dealer, he manages all the water in town.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** Sorry, they.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** It's a they.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** They manage all the water in town.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:32]** There's Carnival Hotel off to the left.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** And then you come up to this four-corner road.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** And it looks like you can just drive straight ahead.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:43]** There's this beautiful bridge made of stone leading from one building to another.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:50]** But there's a yellow plaque on it that says 11 foot 8 inches.

**[00:58:50 - 00:59:14]** and so uh chakramay he's like we're not going that way and he turns to the left and as he's he's turning to the left a truck turns right onto that road and like right as you turn away the that truck just gets peeled open like a tin can on this bridge uh did you see that what oh my god that one's for you jeff

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:33]** i was worried about that yeah that was great that was good that's great and so then the the the bus is gonna make around the corner here and then keep going up and as you turn the next corner back to the street where you would have been if you would have just gone straight um there's a giant coliseum the the arena

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:40]** And out front, there's a pillar that is just beaming projections into the sky.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** And it's flashing.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** And it says, Game Store Gauntlet, make sure you vote on our Twitter.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** And then that flashes away.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:52]** And then the next projection comes up.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Let me see.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Does this work?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]** It's got like a sling with a rock in it.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Life science?

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Life science or culture?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Culture.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Life science or culture.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Okay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:23]** Rolled a nine, and my culture is plus seven, so 15 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** Oh, good.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Okay.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** I made it a 12 because I'm a GM and I can make up my own.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** That's what you can do when you're in the sea.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** You beat 12?

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** Yep.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:33]** And so you know, and I'm just going to read this off straight out of one of the books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Read it straight out, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:41]** When hatched, Akestis are little more than tiny lizards with gaping mouths.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]** Their broodminders, which is like the parent of the group, guide their feeding habits.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:50]** Left to their own, they would seek any organic matter and just devour it.

**[01:01:51 - 01:02:05]** After about five years and three feet of growth, so they only grow about three feet tall, Akestis leave their broodminders and settle down into a more civilized mode, banding together with other adolescents of various age.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:11]** These Akestis collaborate together with their economic, social, and technical skills.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:15]** Typically working around the fringes of civilization as junk traders, mechanics, and scavengers.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:21]** It's only after 10 to 20 years of adolescency that they start to rut.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:28]** And rutting is what leads to what we knew Harag as, as a Rivner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** So Rivner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:55]** so we can we don't know if if uh this image of harag is young but you can you can you know um what's the word figure out there's a famous word for a nice big figure out surmise that's the word thank you uh you could surmise that is anywhere from 10 or 5 to 25 years of age and it doesn't necessarily mean he's he's a child

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** But he is a small creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:03]** We know about as much as about how old Frog is as about as we know how old Will is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Yep.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Yeah.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** Can you tell us about Cookie Cutter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:18]** Cookie Cutter is a Yusuke that was born and raised in one of the smaller towns, Arle.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Sorry, it's not a small town.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** It's actually a city.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** Arle on Akita.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Love it.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]** And he is new to gladiatorship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:38]** Oh, so it's like the rookie versus the established.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** Yeah, and Rog is a big deal at this point.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:49]** He has been the reigning champion of this arena for as long as anybody knows.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** So cool.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** All right, moving on.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** Um, that was just amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Great stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Bam.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** Uh, so you actually pull up to the arena.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:02]** Oh, and that is the stop for this bus.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:10]** And so you pull up, uh, and, and Chuck Tremay says, and a line, it's been a real pleasure driving you folks.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Hope you find what you're looking for here.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:20]** And with a wave, uh, you guys all get off the bus, the sheer and waves his hand and, uh, he, it drives off emitting a cloud of exhaust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:49]** engine rumbles cool so you guys are now on the ground in kathak depot holy cow holy cow we're here we're here um yeah what do you guys want to do that's that's an awful big arena i wonder what all that business about frog and brief cutter was about you ever been to a fight chat i don't think i have

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** Well, I don't think we know that much.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** That's part of the note.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** Why don't we start here?

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:38]** I don't know that these street rats that the CO pointed us to, this Dotrulo, would be at such a place, but it's worth investigating, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:39 - 01:06:03]** can we go i think rolu is gonna just casually start to walk around and look at the wares of everybody hawking in front of the arena selling probably shirts of frog and little hollow displays of them and cool you know plastic weapons and things and he's gonna try and walk around and maybe find somebody to ask if they know do trullo i'm saying that correctly right

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** Doe True Lou.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Doe True Lou.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:10]** So you're just walking up to people and saying, like, hey, do you know Doe True Lou?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** No, that's not what I'm saying.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:24]** I'm just walking up, making small talk, and then just saying that, you know, just wanted to ask, you know, if there are some people here that we wanted to find out some more about somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:31]** I'm going to look for the... Treme's going to look for, like, any seedy-looking merchants.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** and try to surmise.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Maybe we can see what they're dealing with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** Yeah.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:50]** I'll tell you, most of the people you talk to around this area, as soon as they hear you say do-true-loo, they kind of... We're not coming out with it, but like, you know... Okay, if you mention do-true-loo, they're going to shut down and walk away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:50]** Got it.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** So check...

**[01:06:51 - 01:07:06]** Jack is going to be riding along on Cobb's shoulder, looking around to see if there's one stall that's particularly popular or if there's any signage for a local watering hole where we might find more information at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:11]** Well, all the watering holes are controlled by the water dealer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Watering hole bar.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:14]** It was a joke.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:16]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** It's good.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:17]** All right.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:29]** So you guys find there's the seediest character you can find is actually an android kind of off to the side that he's definitely been seeing better days.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** He's missing some screws.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:34]** He's got a face panel is actually just missing completely.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]** And you can see all the gears underneath and wiring and stuff.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Uh, you there.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:21]** Can you tell us anything about who controls this area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:26]** Oh, you are referring to the water dealer.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]** He controls this area.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:34]** We're setting up a business of our own.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:38]** Would we need to talk to such a person?

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** Can you get us in touch with him?

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:43]** We're in need of this water for our new venture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:49]** The water dealer is located at the casino most of the time.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:53]** He does not talk to regular people like you and me.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** What's the water dealer's name?

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** The water dealer?

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** Yeah.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Their name has long been lost.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]** They are known only as the water dealer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** I'd like to buy a frog t-shirt, please.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:15]** I have a feeling this will be worth something one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:21]** Do any of you guys want to roll, let's say, like an intelligence check or would it be like an investigation?

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** What do you like?

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:25]** Maybe a culture check?

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** You're trying to do a perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** I'm looking at intelligence wise.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:33]** I'm going to say it's nothing to do with the Android.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:16]** So you guys start walking towards just where Junker's Delight is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:23]** Sorry, I was standing a bit away because I don't need to be in all interactions as the cop.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:29]** My question to you is, it sounds like the riddle is the Junker's Delight.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** Is that what you took away from this, Jack?

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:38]** He just said there was a riddle and we should go to Junker's Delight.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** Tormadin, any thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:50]** Some proverbial saying, I don't know, but perhaps our only way of finding out more would be to go to this Junkers Delight.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]** Delight shirt sounds nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]** So the witch word says, let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:06]** So you guys start heading down the street towards the shady part of town, which I guess all of Kefauk Deep is pretty shady.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:16]** But as you get closer, you do see a large sign kind of like cut off by other buildings, but you see a bright J. That's cool.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:18]** And you just assume it's the right place.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:28]** And as you're walking down, you kind of hear something, some kind of like scuffling down one of the alleyways near you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:52]** a kerfuffle i think we've been spotted by some group perhaps whips cob what make it what do you make of it i think roll is going to do a perception check and as as you want to roll for that yeah absolutely i want to roll for that i always want to roll for everything that's an 18.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:53]** 18.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:53]** 18.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:56]** 18 will beat it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:08]** So, at the far end of this short, dingy alleyway, a pair of humans with bright red skin clad in leather jackets stand over a prone Yusuke woman.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:12]** They deliver a series of vicious kicks and punches.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:20]** She cries out in pain with every blow, while another Yusuke, who appears similarly dressed to the humans, sneers.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:26]** You knew there were consequences when you refused Dotrolu's generous offer.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** Riddle.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:36]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:36]** What?

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:38]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:55]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.
