## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:18]** Hello, and welcome to Calm, Cool, and Caduceus, your weekly hour to leave behind the walls of the Caduceus and practice mindfulness, reflection, and awareness.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:25]** My name is Rolu, and I'm glad you're here.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:36]** Before we begin, the captain has asked me to remind you of a ship-wide survey about Will Save the Podcast.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:40]** You've listened to us, and now we want to listen to you.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:50]** The survey is available at survey.willsavethepodcast.com on any of your devices.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:56]** And there is apparently a mystery prize if enough crew members take it.

**[00:00:58 - 00:01:02]** It would be a true treat if you could share your thoughts with us.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:09]** And now speaking of your thoughts, let's begin our session.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:16]** Imagine, if you will, in an appendage on the right side of your body, a paintbrush.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** And on the left?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:22]** A paint can full of stars.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** I'd invite you to close your eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:41]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Get in.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Restore balance.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Get out.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** A simple enough plan...

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:58]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:30]** Well, welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** I am Kevin.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** I am your host for Unknown Treasures.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Why are you laughing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Are you waiting for us to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:41]** I was just tapping my microphone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:46]** You usually shout the subtitle of the series.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** We don't want to do it this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I'm completely out of alcohol in my house.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I'm breaking into my wife's.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** She has a bunch of Athletic Brewing Co.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** non-alcoholic beers.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** They're actually pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** But you know, you can get that stuff like door dashed, right?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** Booth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** Yeah.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** She wanted, she wanted to like get a sample pack, but they didn't have sample packs.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:15]** She bought like eight, six packs of like one of each flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** It's health conscious, athletic, non-alcoholic beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Well, she was pregnant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** So she was like, Oh, okay.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** So it's not, I was like,

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** The alcohol is what makes it healthy?

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Or unhealthy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** I haven't had non-alcoholic beer in forever.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** I used to drink it as a kid because my stepdad had O'Doul's.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:41]** And I would just drink it as a seven-year-old and be like... O'Doul's is decent, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** It's not bad.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]** I prefer Heineken Zero if I'm going on alcoholic beers.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** I've never tried Heineken Zero, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:53]** I appreciate today's non-alcoholic, low-alcohol mocktail world.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** I like the mocktails way better.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** Agua Fresca type.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** Yeah, like I can get something tasty and not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:11]** when I was an intern at my company, um, they do, they do like intern, like every week they do a, uh, uh, intern day type thing where they do something special.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:20]** And towards the end they did a, a big, like, um, I forget what they called it, but it was, uh, a gathering of the executives essentially.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** And then the interns to teach them how to be social in a work setting.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** And they had mocktails like, um,

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:32]** I was just chugging up their Mai Tais and mojitos and all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** I like how you need a social lubricant class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** It's like that or like cocaine, I guess.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** Those are two things at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** They had mock cocaine in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:50]** They just popped open like eight pixie sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:52 - 00:05:00]** For reals, I was on an episode of Good Girls Revolt, which I think it's a Prime series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Molly's the pretend cocaine.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:18]** No, I played a heroin addict on Good Girls Revolt and the person next to me was doing cocaine and the prop people, they had an actual heroin needle that would retract so I could stab myself in the arm and

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:24]** They had somebody like bandage, like pull the rubber band to make it tight and show my veins.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:29]** And then this other person was actually snorting some powder every take.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** And I finally asked, like, what are they snorting?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** And they had bags of, I forget what company it is.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** No, it was peanuts or some kind of nut.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:42]** And it comes, they buy it, like ground up into a powder.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** And they have one that looks like, you know, cocaine.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:48]** They have another one that looks like... Why would you snort peanuts, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Do they ask you if you have an allergy first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** I'm sure they asked.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I wasn't the one snorting it, so they didn't ask me.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** I don't know, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:03]** I feel like any place that would let you stab yourself with, like, a heroin needle is probably not... Well, it's a fake heroin needle, but you're actually snorting something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** Yeah, but it's edible food waste or food...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** But it goes into your nasal cavity.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** I don't think through my nose, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:16]** That's the operating part of the... I'd rather have cocaine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:22]** I think we just invent a small vacuum that attaches to your nose.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** And then as you do it, it really pulls up into the vacuum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** The person doing it had no complaints.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** So, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** Straight up B12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** I've heard of people snorting B12.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Dude, I want to get a B12 shot.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:40]** I want to do that Dr. Feelgood thing where you get a whole panel put into your body or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Dr. Feelgood, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** Sounds cool.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** I'm unfamiliar with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:53]** Google Dr. Feelgood and JFK because he helped treat his Addison's disease.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Yeah, they put an IV of stuff in it.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:00]** It's common knowledge, which, by the way, we don't common knowledge.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** Also, we don't endorse anyone doing any illicit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** No, none of that.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** But this isn't illicit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Substances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Just back to me being the heroin addict.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:15]** The first take, there was somebody who worked on the it was one of the crew, not anybody on the set.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:19]** And they like after the take, we're like, you're doing that wrong.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** And I'm like, yeah, I've never shot heroin before.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:45]** know how to do this yeah he was like let me show you and i was like how do you know how to do it and he said that he used to be a medic i think in the military in england and there was one night that these two idiots fell on his door and they were they were like can you shoot us up for me and he's like i'd rather shoot them up the right way than have them die on my doorstep right and i was like wow okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** He gave some guys a heroin.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** That's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** That's a fun day of filming is all I got to say.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** It was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:02]** I've been in Extra a couple times, but then one time I already told you was on 7th Heaven, but the other time... Wait, I don't remember this.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** What?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** You did not.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I told you this.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]** That's how I met David Gallagher, and we were hanging out for X amount of years or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** What?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Okay, hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** There was a whole intro we covered about this.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** I don't recall any of this.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Granted, I have a terrible memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:20]** Was it in the first 52 episodes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** I can't fucking remember.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** I have a script of the episode.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** I can conjure it up in a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** I'm just saying I may or may not have been there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** Oh, really?

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** It was before Vinny came on.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** So let's reiterate for Vinny then.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Just go for short, quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** Well, yeah, David Gallagher.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:46]** I was on a I was on an episode of Seventh Heaven purely as an extra, but I was just like moving my lips like in the background talking to David.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:55]** Circumstances ended up being the case that he ended up coming over to my house because like him and my mom and his mom ended up becoming friends somehow through this incident.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:01]** Anyway, and then he would take me clubbing, and, like, we would hang out and play Halo and ****, and, like, for years, like, we would do this.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** And he tried to make me cool, was kind of, like, the point of the story.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** But it just didn't happen.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** But, like, we were, like, hanging out.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** I became somewhat cooler than I was back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** I was, like, ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** But, like, yeah, yeah, it was a good time.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** I'd argue you were way cooler than David Gallagher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:23]** Maybe these days, because possibly through Will Save, I'm probably more well-known than this thing is.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Oh, my God.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Wow.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** He was in Richie Rich.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** He was in Richie Rich, too.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I'm looking at his... There's nothing better than the voice of Riku.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Saving Grace.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:32]** That's the best thing.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** Smallville episode.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** He was the voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Angels in the End Zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** He's Riku from Kingdom Hearts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** That's what I most like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** Right.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** He's Riku from Kingdom Hearts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** I like Kingdom Hearts a lot.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** But it's just the voice.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** But so he's super well-known.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** He's fine.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** He's known as Riku.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** But, like, whatever.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** We'll save... We'll one day eclipse David.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Sorry, David.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** So you guys aren't friends anymore, is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** It's a long story, but we did stop hanging out.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** It's probably my fault.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** And then, yeah.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** It's complicated.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:07]** It's a story I'll tell another time, actually, how that probably happened.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** But I was probably like 15 or 16.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I think I was like 15 years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** He was in Super 8, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Yeah, he was.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** But that was like the last thing I ever saw of him.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** He was high.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** He was on drugs, actually, the entire movie.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** That was his role.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** So he was like a Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** We don't want to speculate on that.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** I'm sure he was suffering from exhaustion.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Please don't sue us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:33]** The only other like extra thing, there were a couple of things, but the main other thing that I did was there was this movie.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** It was probably a student film for all I know called Boobs.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** And it was just about boobs.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** And there was like a girl.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Is that the one with huge boobs?

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:45]** Is that the one with Ross from Friends?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** I have no fuck.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** I literally have no idea.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** I literally probably slept through the entire experience.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:56]** But my entire job was to be the kid in class behind the girl who wanted bigger boobs just looking at her, checking her out.

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:03]** And then the whole thing was at the end when she had no boobs because she stopped trying to pretend that she did have them.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** They were like...

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** I still accepted her or something.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** I guess that was like my extra role.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** I was like, you're still cute even without your boobs.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:14]** Anyway, it was a weird story, but that was my extra role.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I didn't do anything cool such as like heroin or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Wow.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** I'm trying to think.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** What a doozy of an episode this has been.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** We're just all over the place here.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** We're all over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:31]** David, I'm sorry, but I really want Will Save to become bigger than your entire career.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** And I think we can do this coming up.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** We can both have big careers, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** Kelly, I'm DMing you because I want that episode number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Oh, from 7th Heaven?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Yeah, same.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** I want to buy the DVD box set of 7th Heaven.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Just to find the one episode he's in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** I have it.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Jen's a huge 7th Heaven fan.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** I've definitely seen this episode already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:57]** You need to legally send that to me through the post.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:01]** Not through digital ripping or anything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:04]** Later on, I'll look up the, I have the script.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** I think it's from that episode.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Cause I got the script that day.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** It was like a gift or something that was signed or whatever.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** I think it's of the same app.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:15]** I don't know if I made the final cut to the app or not, but I can tell you the episode that was on.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** So that's neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:22]** And we definitely won't post that clip in our Discord for copyright purposes ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:31]** Well, if we do that, we have to put Kevin's entire filmography, which he has like a pretty... I want, yeah, I want to see Kev draw down on some foos.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** He starred in a movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:41]** I'm going upriver now, but David Schwimmer was in a movie called Breastman that came out when I was in high school.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** So I tried to watch it on HBO all the time.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Cool.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Well, anyways, let's get to playing Starfinder.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Yeah?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** You guys want to play?

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Sure.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** No?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** You guys want to keep talking about movies and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Nah, it's good.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** We should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** All right.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Let's play.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Change the music.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** Make it happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Here we go.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:10]** Yep, I'll just wave my magic wand that is somehow connected directly via Bluetooth to Syrinscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Last time.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** What are we doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** What?

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Sorry.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Every time, Kelly.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Every time.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Last time, Kelly interrupted me.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:24]** It's literally rule one is don't interrupt people.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** I thought we were clapping again.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** No.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** I don't know why I thought that.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:35]** Okay, last time, Thaddeus confronted Rollu, taking full advantage of him being paralyzed.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:41]** Chak and Termay cautiously joined in the questioning, and it was Chak that pulled out the blue stone from Rollu's hidden compartment.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:47]** Termay was able to identify that object to be the base element from an unknown star.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:56]** Leaving Rolly shackled, you all made some deal to at least finish the work and the mission before resolving things.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** But Chalk is going to hold on to the object in his pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Tremay and Chalk... Noticeable bulge.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Noticeably in his pants.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Chalk is so confused.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** I was like, f*** Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Packin' heat!

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:15]** You thought Shaq had big dick energy after killing Dickerton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Ha ha ha!

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** He has big puck energy now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Big puck energy.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** It's glowing, too.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Big glowing in magical darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:26]** Ask me about my star metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:33]** All I can say is putting radioactive material near your genitals is not a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Kev would know.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Jack, we're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Star materials, probably.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:48]** Termay and Chalk then turned their attention to the computers, and with a bit of teamwork, they found Variate's watch containing all of Variate's research.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:56]** They also learned that Gray may have wanted the stone to find a distant location and possibly open up a drift portal to it.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** So that's where we are.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** We are in the room.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Let me take you guys over to the map.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** We're still in that lab.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** Rolu is all tied up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:11]** So my hands are bound and my feet are bound, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** No, I think it was just your hands.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** We want you to be able to walk out, you know what I mean?

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Strut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** Saunter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** Soft shoe.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:23]** Soft shoe.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** You have the entangled condition on you, correct, Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** Yes, that is what my hero lab is telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:34]** I'm just saying, if you want to get out of entangled...

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** I'm going to need a strength check.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:40]** And if you want to try to do that quietly, you can just tell everybody else to take their headphones off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** That's annoying because he probably is pretty strong.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** I'm actually peeked behind the curtain.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** No, I'm not.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Also, I don't think I'm very good at time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Can't confirm.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Maybe.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I don't know.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Sagan?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** Am I that good at tying things?

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:57]** Did I tie them up proficiently enough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** When a stoppable force meets a movable object?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** I'm going to say yes.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:09]** I think I gave you the entangled condition automatically because he was paralyzed.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** So I'm not sure...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** Yeah, you could definitely tie him real tight.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** He was frozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** So you might not be able to tie him tight, but you're able to tie multiple knots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Just for pirates, we know how to tie knots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** Right, yeah.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** There's not even a knot.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** It's just a whole rat's nest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:34]** That is actually what's keeping spaceships from floating away is when you come into port, you tie it to the station or the rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Do tell what's a rat's nest.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** What is that?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** That's something people climb to get up the mast and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:40 - 00:17:03]** so I mean that's just like when you're trying to untie when you give it a child a knot to untie and they somehow loop the string 18 times on itself or like picking a piece of jewelry out of like a ball of jewelry that's like a rat's nest I'm assuming that's what rat's nests actually look like I've never actually seen a rat's nest do rats have nests?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:07]** I guess they do they gotta raise their small children somewhere


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** It just lived in corners.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** I didn't think it looked that cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** Let's go ask Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:24]** Hey, so while you all are busy looking at the things, did I give one of you my last serum of healing?

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** I am not doing great.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:37]** And of course, since I'm all tied up and acting all complicit and moving forward and going back to the ship, I don't want to alarm you if I happen to cast a spell.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Wouldn't want to...

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** Have a shot in the head from you, Thaddeus.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I need some healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Could someone just check on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Check, yeah.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:55]** I want to make sure that what you're saying is right, Rolu, because we don't want to give you our last serum if you're going to, I don't know, betray us again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** You're really convincing me that you believe me.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Thank you, Thaddeus.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Who's checking?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** You?

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Yeah.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** No.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Roland Hobson puts his butt towards Ethanus.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** You checking?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** It's so uncomfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** Shaq, Tomei, either way, you're pretty good at this.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I don't know anything about that.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** What am I doing again, Terry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Just check his health.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** You're pretty good at pulling things from my pockets.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** This should be easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I'll have a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:29]** You had two serums before the last?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** I actually think that I gave all of them.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Like, I used all of them for other people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Because Treme stabbed you in the head with your own serums.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** During the conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** That's right, so maybe that was the last one.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** Okay.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** All right.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:46]** So, Jack, you don't find any, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** Nope.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** How is he doing, though, Shaq?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** How's his health?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:55]** Jack, like, squeezes his ribs and checks his pulse, but grabs him in the wrong place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Checks his pulse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Oh, I do have a medicine skill.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Never mind.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** Hang on.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** I thought I was untrained in medicine.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:08]** It's a 17, so I'd say he's got a decent idea of how you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** 5 out of 20 stamina.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** 11 out of 24 HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Gotcha.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Thanks, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** I'll make note of that.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** He's alright.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** We should probably... I don't know.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Maybe we should rest.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** How are we feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** Do we want to take a... Yeah, let's rest.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Now that's an idea.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** Someone... I will rotate watches watching Rulu.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** I'll take first watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:32]** Okay, before we do anything else, you guys made a deal.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** I just want to know what the deal was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:41]** The deal was that... So Rolu was previously entangled and grappled because he was tied up and held down by me.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:52]** He's no longer held down because we agreed that we would keep him tied up and if he... Basically until he goes back to the ship is what we're trying to do.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** And we're going to keep the puck away from him.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** But if anything bad happens, we want him to be able to help probably, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:02]** So that's it.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Okay.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:08]** The next thing I was going to ask is, are you guys done with the room?

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:14]** And just so we're clear, you have the watch that Variate has all of their research on.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:24]** But that watch – basically the research on that watch and the equipment in this room are kind of what VARI 13 is looking for.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** That is what VARI 13 remembers and is seeking.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** So we have everything we need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** Can we go search this area for anything or –

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** What area is that?

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** This area that I drew, just sort of weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** Oh, so the equipment off to the left-hand side of the room?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:48]** There's a lot of desks and equipment.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:57]** We mentioned this prior to the combat was everything kind of on the outskirts of this room is dilapidated and broken.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:08]** And it's very clear that the Grey disassembled everything to build up the prototype drift drive in a way that they needed it to be.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** That make sense?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** So you're not going to find anything in those corners, I'd say.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** But you can roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Yeah, I mean, I'll just search the room.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** Even just to search for other dangers, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** I think that your idea to me of taking a rest is a good one.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** We don't know what we're going to encounter on our way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** And I got a one.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:34]** So I'm sure that I feel very confident that there is nothing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** All right.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:39]** And so you guys are going to take a rest, you're saying?

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Yeah, take ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** Take ten or a full night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** I would say ten.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:50]** I don't know that Jack feels safe enough to take a full night's rest.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** Yeah, I think that probably makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:22:05]** As Rolo eases into sitting on the edge of this area where the drift energy was flowing, he turns to Jack and Tormei.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** So what did you find out about this gray?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** What did she want?

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** I was very curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:16]** Well, you heard her say, drift on, drift off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:21]** Yeah, but you're the one looking at this computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** Yeah, we found almost coordinates.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:32]** There's like an X and a Y, but there's not a Z, so we don't exactly know what she was moving toward.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** We've got a good idea.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Can I see?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Sure.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:41]** And Chuck shows Ralu the readout.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** It's you, like, scrolling up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** I'm scrolling down.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Zooming in, zooming in.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** Tell me when you're done.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** Missed some Quaternions.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** I could see.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Okay.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Thanks, Chuck.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** So how'd you get this puck?

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** How did I get this puck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Yeah, that's what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:05]** in your moment of glory with the junk murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Yeah, that was a good time.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** That was fun.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:19]** It was in that time that when it fell from your incredible shot that, well, that happened to be inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:25]** So, Chuck, you put two and two together that, like, you saw him pull something out of Tinkerton's head.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** And you're like, ah, that's what he pulled.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** How did you know to look there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Well...

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** It's a little bit of... I'm sure you know I'm very sensitive to things that might happen.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:42]** Well, also, it's a bit of luck.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:46]** Sometimes the two come together serendipitously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** That sounds like bulls**t, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Let's put it this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** I didn't know you were a cow farmer too, Rolu.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Chuck slowly, like, slides away.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:10]** Not so far that they can't continue speaking, but, like, doesn't feel as safe standing right next to Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** For real.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** I knew that it would be here in Junker's Delight.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:21]** And I was confident that based on our mission here, it might be something that I could find.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** So as you see, that's the precognition part.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:30]** And then there's the luck that we happen to be in the right place at the right time.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** Every story of Rolloos has just a huge gap in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Have you noticed?

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** So much doesn't add up.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** Doesn't add up.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** But okay, if you say so.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** All right.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Is everyone feeling good?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Topped off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** Do we successfully, Mr. GM, take 10 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** You could try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** That's what we're trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** That's what all that dialogue was.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:55]** Yeah, that was 10 minutes of dialogue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** That was 10 minutes of dialogue?

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Was that relaxing, though?

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** 10 minutes of what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:07]** And, you know, while we're rested here, I wonder what's next.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Should we head back out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** We should, but we should be careful.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** This ship is full of spooky stuff.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** We don't know what we're going to encounter on the way back.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Yeah.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** Let's make a beeline for it.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:33]** And I'll say, like, right as you were saying that very serendipitously, you hear this strange hiss coming from outside the lab, I guess, at this point.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Because you guys are in the lab.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** There's only one door.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:42]** So through that door, there's almost a strange hiss, like a... I don't like the sound of that.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** And you also...

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:52]** You also then hear clang, clang, clang, clang, which I'm distinguishing differently from the clink, clink that you heard earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** To close the loop, we did indeed take a 10-minute rest, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** You all burned a resolve point to do that?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** I'm just making sure you guys are keeping tabs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Yep.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** I didn't need to burn.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** I was fine.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** I didn't need to do it either.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** All right.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Just chill.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Cool.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Checked it.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** I didn't rest during my 10 minute rest.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** I was just hanging out.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Oh, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** Okay.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** So what's your plan?

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:22]** So there's a big clang and the doors, because remember that was like a decontamination chamber.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:28]** Was the clang clang and the bump bump on the doors outside of the chamber or on the doors to the room that we're in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:37]** So the doors in the cleaning room at the base of the lab are open from when you came through last time.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Gotcha.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:44]** So what you're hearing is kind of like whatever sound that is from wherever it's coming from funneling through that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Kevin, just let me know.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** I rebuilt my armor.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** You know, the breakaway ages.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** And then also reloaded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** All right.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Thank you for informing me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Way to call it out.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Cool.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:06]** I think Chuck is going to, in his curiosity, amble over to the doors and press his ear against it to try to get a better idea of what's out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** Those doors are open, right?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** You can see through them.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** They should be open.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** I don't think you guys closed them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Are both sets open?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** I didn't think you could have both sets of doors open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** Well, this isn't a functional ship at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:22]** Okay, then I guess I will... It's not like an active clean room.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:28]** I'm going to retcon it so that Jack peers around the corner instead of stepping into what is clearly a murder hole.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** A murder hole, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** I mean, it looks like a good ambush point.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:38]** Maybe we just find our way straight back out, make a beeline for it.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** What do you guys think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** A hole that opens up into a new area.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Is there one?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** Well, if there's... I thought that's what Shaq was looking at.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** We should probably just head back, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** That's what I mean.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Make a straight beeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Make like a dog and get the fuck out of here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Yeah.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** I don't need to fight no ghosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** You do then hear there's a crackle that echoes throughout the room.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** And this time it's in every room.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** It's in the room you're in.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** You hear this crackle.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Yeah, let's get the fudge out of here.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Yeah, you can't mic me.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:48]** alright maybe you can and then there's a rustling and some clicks and there there I think it's working there and uh you hear excellent put him with the android and then speaking directly into the comm unit coming over the intercom system you hear Tez Tronin say well looks like you're trapped in there and you have what we want so how about you bring us the treasures or we'll have to come in and take them from you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Actually, yeah, you should come in.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Yeah, you should definitely do that.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** It's totally cool and not at all dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** So are you trying to talk back to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Yeah.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** I'm assuming the intercom is two-way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I got an 18 on engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** So engineering 18, that works.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:18]** You can actually see on the comm unit right above Chuck where he's hanging out the door, there's a comm unit there and there's a button that if you push it, you can talk back to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:22]** Do we want to tell them to come in and get it and have them guns blazed?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:28]** Or do we want to feign like we're going to comply and be like, we're hurt.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** We can't move.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Come inside, help us.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** We'll give you your treasures in exchange for our lives.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Wink, wink.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Or we could do something else.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** What do you feel like, guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:47]** There's an old pre-cap movie called Home Alone.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Oh.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:55]** I think between... If we can get some... Movie traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** I love where your head's at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** Re-enable this gun at the front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:12]** i like i like where your head's at man i'll uh i also got this proximity thing if we gotta you know make that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** So do you reply back to Tez?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:22]** Yeah, should we tell her a story about our sad sorrows or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** I would like to... I'm assuming that Tremé tells Chak how to use the button.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Chak is...

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:42]** Jack is going to bluff them by recounting the entire plot of Home Alone.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** I don't get it.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:52]** To give the rest of the crew time to set traps and re-enable this gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** All right, cool.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** How does that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** So you're going to give me a bluff, Jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** I would love to.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:09]** Can I assist?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** I have a plus 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** No, no, that's plenty.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** That's plenty.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** Has Tremaden seen the movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:19]** I feel like there's the wet bandits, right?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** That's who we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:41]** so you guys are like discussing like what your plan is to to get out how to get out of here and chalk's like no no i got this he clicks a button he's like so there was this family in a big mansion and just starts going on and on about home alone uh so this is how we're gonna go through it this is how we're gonna move forward um

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:45]** We know now that the true warriors are laying siege to the stellar flare, and you don't know how long you have.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** It's probably until he finishes his bluff check.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Or you guys could just stop now and walk out.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** I'm just saying you could walk out with your hands up and finish this whole campaign.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** But since you're not going to do that, I am going to let you set up traps.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** We're going to call it a scrap point system.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** We're going to work this in.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:09]** You can build traps and seal doors using scrap points.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:13]** So what I need now, I need to know how much each of you are carrying.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** How much scrap do you have in your inventories?

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** You have come across scrap several times in this series.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:23]** I'm just curious if any of you actually threw it into your inventory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:30]** I threw in at one point, I think, some, but I don't see it on my sheet.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:37]** But I have a spell for... Oh, no, that's nothing.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** I mean, honestly, I didn't pick any up.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** I do have like this junk gun, which I could just try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** I'm looking for a specifically junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:54]** Well, could we like scrap parts of the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** So yes, if you don't have anything else, we can move forward.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** Okay, so you guys are starting off with zero scrap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** I still have the proximity.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** I have one other proximity.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** And I have the one that was already set up too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** That one is set up.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** I have that one on note.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:15]** So you guys can take time to spread out and collect broken pieces of electronic metal or debris.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** So are the three of you going to go out and find scrap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:41]** anywhere specific or do you want to just do a general search um i think if check wanted to search for scrap while speaking into this intercom he'd have to search within this room so you could start i'll give you a perception check 12 okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:48]** you're able to find one piece of scrap, like out of all the junk that's in the corners and stuff.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** You're like, I think that part is usable.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** And you pointed out to somebody else to pick up.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** So you got one, one piece of scrap.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Um, who's going next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** I'll go next.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Yeah.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Yeah.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** I was going to go through the hallways.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Maybe, uh, do we need to move or,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** Just tell me where you're going, and if you guys can recall the map, or do you need me to move you around and show you the map?

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Sorry, where is Shaq looking for scrap?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Shaq was looking for scrap in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Yeah, because this seems like a really good room for that.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** So I should look somewhere else.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** It makes more sense to look elsewhere if Shaq has this covered.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Or is there just enough scrap for both of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** I see you drew a big thing on the map, Will.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Okay, so you're looking at that computer room that you guys went to before?


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:32]** So go ahead, give me either a perception or engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** I'll do engineering.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:40]** Because I have a zero perception and a plus one engineering.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** For a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** You get three points of scrap.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** So what is the scrap economy?

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** I'll get to that in a minute.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:56]** Okay, Kelly, what region are you looking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:01]** So in this room, if I look in this room, that's not valid anymore, right?

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Or is there just enough scrap in here where...

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** I could just look here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:12]** The room you're in right now, I'm going to say that if you try to look here again, I'm going to just raise the DC up even higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Okay.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** All right.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Well, I can't remember the layout of this place.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Do you want to go search?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** Let's move fast.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** You're not on a speed restraint.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Will checked out the one with the ghosts.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Is that right?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** The ghosts were over here.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** You checked the one across from that.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** I checked this one over here.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** So you guys just walked down to the hallway right outside of those doors, and there's those two rooms.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:41]** To the right, there is the room where the ghosts were, and the bodies of those two are probably still in there.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:48]** And then to the left was the server room with the computer and all the servers where you guys got electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:52]** I guess I can look in like the... Yeah, I'll look in the ghost room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** 16.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Okay.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** You get one point of scrap.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Wow, I thought you guys would roll a lot higher in all this.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:06]** Do you want Rolu to help you search at all, or is he going to just be hanging out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** I was going to ask Thaddeus before he left.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** You know, I'm trained as an engineer.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I clearly am interested in all of us getting out of here.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** I understand the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Rolu, here's the thing.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Thaddeus comes back into the room.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Rolu, let's go look for some scrap, you and me, all right?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** I'm going to use your sharp vision and your engineering prowess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Come on.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Thank you.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** I'll walk along with you.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** For being in support of me being imprisoned.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** No one's letting you free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** I'm going to set up some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:36 - 00:37:00]** booby traps maybe at some key points maybe but i'll wait for you guys to get searching but if there's no time constraint so overall you guys have what five points total right now one from chalk one from thaddeus and three from yeah so five total i'm keeping track of this all right rolu put that brain if you're gonna let rolu search so rolu give me an engineering check or a perception check

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** And tell me what region you're looking in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** Where have you already searched?

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:06]** We've already checked the computer room and the room where the ghosts were.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** So somewhere else where you think there might be more parts.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Scrap around, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** I am also, John, struggling to remember where we went.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** It's all right.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** We'll look together.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Watch out for that claymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** Yeah, there's one around that corner, by the way.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I see.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Right here.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:26]** You let me know a little too... I'm going to say they gave you enough ample warning to get around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:31]** I feel like Daddy's pushed me a little bit as I'm trying to walk around.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** He's like, don't trip, don't trip.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Do I have to search in a room or can I look in the hallways?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Yeah, you can search in the hallway.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** So are you looking in the hallway right outside the front door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** I am honestly walking around because I'm trying to recall what rooms we've gone in.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:47]** Okay, so right now, you guys have the three of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Chuck is back there still running through.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:54]** He's getting to the point where they got on the airplane and the mother realizes he's gone.

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:01]** And the three of you, Torme...

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:06]** Rolu and Thaddeus have moved down the center towards the front.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:20]** And as you guys get close enough to those doors in the front, you see the gun turret recessed into the ceiling and you see the scanner and those doors are slammed shut.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:28]** And what you can see is glowing red and orange kind of around the edges of that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** Looks like they're trying to take this door down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:37]** And you hear that clang, clang, very loud and very clear coming from that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Is that a separate engineering check to know what that is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** I think it's very clear what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Right, but like, okay, that's fine.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** I was just going to ask.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Are they melting down the door?

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Yeah, like are they melting?

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Is it like a lightsaber or not a lightsaber?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Sorry, an energy sword going through?

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Yes, the energy sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** I would say it's more of on the framework.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** They're like slowly cutting through the sides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** They got a plasma cutter.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** They got a plasma ooga booga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Plasma ooga booga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:07]** But what you do see is the patrol bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:32]** um right there so you can repair it i'm just trying to go to the place in the strategic map where there are the most resources that's all i'm trying to because i don't know how the scrap economy if it matters so so you can give me an engineering check on the control bot okay the dead corpse of the control hope i roll high that's a natural 19 for 28


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Wow, okay.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:37]** I'm going to say you can get six points of scrap from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** See, I told you, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** Cool.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:44]** Okay, with that, let me share with you... Let's be clear that Thaddeus is the one picking up the scrap.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Thanks for finding that, Rulu.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** You're still tied up, don't forget.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:52]** But I could use your help repairing this turret.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Can you come over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** So...

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** I'll need my hands to be in the front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Let's go over how scrap points are actually going to work.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** I just shared the document with you.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Can you guys all see that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** So what it says is that for one scrap point, you can make a decoy.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** For two scrap points, you can seal a door.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:17]** For four scrap points, you can build a barricade that is 10 foot by 5 foot.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:23]** And for six scrap points, you can construct a trap in a hallway or a door.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** And you guys have a total of 11 scrap points to share.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:33]** So we can get one decoy, one barricade, and one trap if we're just going by sheer number of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:39]** Is that inclusive of us potentially repairing anything that was already in place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:44]** Okay, so the turret in the middle, if you guys are looking at that, is that what you said?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:50]** I'm going to say that takes 10 points, 10 scrap points to do if you want the turret to work.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** I think it's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Absolutely.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** We can just choke them off right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Or you could tear it down and use that for four points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** We know where they're coming through.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** I don't think they're really in the mood to go digging.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Maybe they are, maybe they aren't.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** I don't know.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Digging for what?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** Well, there was those entry points where dirt was coming in, right?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Right.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Like from the outside?

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Seems unlikely.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Yeah, it's doubtful, I think.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** I think maybe if we just get him at a choke point here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** I think it's good to make a stand here and we can retreat tactfully as needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:31]** Yeah, we can retreat back into the chamber and make our final stand there if it comes to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** There's a couple of intersections of hallways we could take cover and fire from as we need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Yeah.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** And we have a booby trap behind us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Is it?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yes.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Okay.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Got it.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** So we can repair the turret and create a decoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** Do we have to create the decoy now or can we do that on the fly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:50 - 00:42:00]** Also, can we trigger the... Do we want to draw them into this hallway somehow with the decoy and then... Kev, can you take off your headphones so you don't hear us scheming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** So you don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:33]** don't i do you i mean yes so then you wouldn't you wouldn't believe it he takes an iron and attaches it to a rope puts that on a spring so that as soon as they open the door they get clobbered right in the face it's it's it was the best and he was like you filthy animals yeah you filthy animals keep the change keep the change it's so funny in fox voice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Yeah.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** All right, well, who's going to repair this turret?

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** I think Shock, you're pretty good at engineering, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Roldu, why don't you and he work on it?

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Shock has a plus five.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** I thought you asked me, I have a plus nine.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:51]** Well, you can, I'm sure Shock's nimble enough to do it with his hands and you can help him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** Yes, you hear the hands part.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** You hear from the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Shock's a little busy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Do we need to roll?

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** Or does the 10 scrap points allow us to automatically do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** You're going to use the scrap points to do things.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** To make a roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** To repair the turret.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** We already rolled because that's how many scrap points we have.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** So the untrained can just do it with the scrap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Yeah, so we can... Brolu could do it with his hands tied behind his back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Yeah, perfect.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:21]** Weird, very specific scenario, totally.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Get this turret up and going.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Do we want to draw him into here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Do we put a decoy there?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Where do we want to put a decoy?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:34]** I feel like if we put a decoy down the middle, they'll probably see that first.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:41]** Better to put it off to the side and then have somebody fire so they look that way and then we fire from the other direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** Okay, so you guys are fixing the turret and then using a decoy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Okay.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** Let me drop this turret back in place.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:53]** I'm going to remind you that this thing targeted everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Couldn't we reprogram it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** If you go to reprogram it, how are you going to get it to tell you not to target you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** That's what I'm asking.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Well, there's...

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** We could code it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:14]** You're asking software engineers that question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Give me a culture check, I guess.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** It would be recall knowledge, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Sure.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Culture.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Or check your notes.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** I got a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:26]** Cool.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** So you remember the badges.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:51]** badges we don't need no stinking badges those two badges that you picked off of the two dead bodies in the study room are what this thing will analyze to say you are their friend or foe badges so I would say that's a fair warning I think to maybe like wait don't forget the badges we need those stinking badges

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** It's the treasure of the Sierra Madre.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:58]** If you want to get rid of Rolu, make sure you have him standing in the hallway without a badge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Without a badge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Sorry, what was it?

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** We need a question, Rolu.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** We need to know more, I suppose.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Rolu, you don't have a badge.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:12]** I think that's probably Treme and I, so let's get you safely around the corner.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** All right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** This thing is going to come on.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** It's going to target you if you don't have it.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** Yes, sorry, I'm just relishing in your concern for my safety.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:34]** I'm going to put a proximity mine above in the ceiling maybe just before, as you step out of the scanner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** There we are.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Nice.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** Could you perhaps move my... I would like to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** And I think I should put one or two somewhere else.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:49]** So I'm going to put one here, if that's cool.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** With a barbed shrapnel grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** You're placing a barbed shrapnel grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** With a proximity switch, a Mark I proximity switch.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** Remember what a barbed shrapnel grenade does, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** A barbed shrapnel grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Just have it ready.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** That's all I'm asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Okay.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** It has an embed property and an explode property.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** So do you need to do an engineering check to make that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:19]** I don't believe so for the proximity switch, although I will check.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** Yeah, nothing here.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:34]** It just does a perception check with a plus eight per mark level for detecting people within five feet.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** So I'm putting it at the choke point here.

**[00:46:36 - 00:47:02]** i'm gonna put one um it's not the drone won't set it off i don't think so i could put one by the drone when they go to get their kill on it'll go off great maybe i'll put it behind it you know put some that burger wrapper i think i see over in the corner just to obscure the the thing so you know it doesn't look like they're falling into a trap but they are i like the way you think

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** And I got one more.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Do I save it?

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Because we already got the other one, too.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** But it's only rigged with a flash grenade.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** But that could be useful.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Okay.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** I think we're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** All right.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:23]** So just to recant, you guys used 10 scrap points to fix the turret.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** Somebody give me an engineering check on that.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** All right.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** And I'll let you assist if you want.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:28]** 13.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** I guess Jack will haul our advice down the hole.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** No, he won't.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** I can assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** What is this for, Kiv?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** I got it.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** I assist.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:43]** So 15 total.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** What is this for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** None of your business.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** So it's a 15 total.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Got it.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Yeah.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** What am I assisting then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** To fix the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** I thought we did that with the scrap points.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** I didn't think we had a role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:00]** You fixed it, and I'm adjusting something based off of your roles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** Well, I got an 18 on my roll, but I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** That was to assist though.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Okay.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** So we got the turret.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** We got this one here right at the scanner is a, what'd you call it?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Percussion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:14]** Shrapnel.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Barb shrapnel grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Okay.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** What is this circle here for?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:44]** another uh well let's do frag mark two okay there's a frag mark two in the hallway just past the the turret we have the proximity um sensor with the flash grenade uh right as you turn the corner past the that first set of uh rooms where's your decoy we want to draw them into the center so where do we want to be and where do they want to put the decoy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** Guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:53]** So then he sets up a bucket with glue in it, and it just pours all over the guy, right?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:58]** And he steps into the living room, goes to turn the light on, but it turns the light on, and it turns a fan on.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** It just blows the entire room full of feathers.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** This guy looks like a stuffed chicken.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** It's the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Is there just static on the other end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Well, it's like a two-way radio.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** As long as he's talking, there's no responding.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:26]** And I think, honestly, what's going on is that you guys hear this, the way the intercom system is set up, it's going over the entire intercom system.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:32]** So as you guys are discussing where to put the decoy and stuff, you just hear Chuck going on and on about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** Thaddeus is like, I really need to see this movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:42]** Thaddeus, I would like to be able to help and use my gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:53]** Rolu, right behind Rolu's back, you hear this and you feel the heat of the dash go behind you and it just holds it there for a second.

**[00:49:54 - 00:50:02]** He draws it next to the nape of your neck and then slowly just cuts the cord behind you all the way down.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** I'll be keeping an eye on you.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** How long have you been planning this?

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Planning?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Planning what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** All right, so that decoy, where is that decoy going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** No, no, no, hold on.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:20]** You've been on to me from our first, second encounter.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:31]** Do you remember when you foolishly acted as a leader and, well, you made the mistake by chastising Torme afterwards, but that's neither here nor there.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** Since then, you've been pushing...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** From the very start, you have been a suspicious person.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:45]** You remember the very first time I met you, you lied about how you even got to the Caduceus.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** How you were transported there.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** You just tried to disguise it as a joke, but it was really suspicious.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** And you've been suspicious over and over and over again.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:59]** And you were Hears' high ranking on Hears' ship.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** I already knew this.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** It automatically makes you suspicious.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** So, I didn't like you from the beginning.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:13]** You were suspicious from the start, and your suspicion quadrupled when we found out about what he was doing.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** So don't act as if I've been setting you up.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** This was going to happen.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** And then we found that stuff on you while you were sleeping.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** It's obvious, man.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:32]** There's more that I could say, but we can talk about that later at the ship, about how we know that you were really suspicious.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** Sure, let's talk about it later.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Trying to gaslight me and everyone.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** I know you.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** And I'm not going to have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:44]** I don't want to break up the party here, but we still got to put this decoy down.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:49]** Thaddeus, where do you suppose we should do that, given your tactical expertise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** Well, if we're going to keep pushing back into the engine room, we could probably do it after.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** All the way in the back.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Shut up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** You can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:02]** Everyone's questioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Behind the innocent people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:09]** So you set up this wonderful trap right here.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Why don't we do it a bit further back?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** So that will be the third thing they run into if they get that far.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Well, do we want to put it right where you are?

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** No, no.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Further back this way, my man.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** You see that?

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** You have your claymore there or whatever that is.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It's a decoy, right?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** Perhaps.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Well, further back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** So what does the decoy do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** It will draw their attention, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:32]** Yeah.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** So we want to draw them to this hallway or through it.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:47]** And at the very end, I'll have a nice surprise with this flash, and then maybe we can come around the corner here, and maybe somebody will be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** Okay, when you're saying here and here, where are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:57]** So I feel at this junction, we should just be at all three points of this junction.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:22]** uh and have the decoy at the center of this junction so they'll come through they'll see the bot they'll they'll fight the bot and then they'll if if they're drawn to the decoy they'll try to get to the decoy right yeah i like that idea rolu is massaging his wrists and his hands and stretching them out i i think that's a great idea for me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:31]** So as you guys are debating this, you see those gold flame lines essentially running further and further up and down the door.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:35]** And you hear that clang, clang every once in a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:40]** I think it's getting near the witching hour, as it were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** So they finally get in the house.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** They get to him.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** They hang him up on a door hanger, because that's rude.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:59]** And this groundskeeper guy that's been scaring him the whole time, rolls him with a snow shovel, hits him in the face, takes Kevin down off of the hook, and saves the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** So where's that decoy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:16]** I think we put the decoy kind of within sight, like kind of in between these two arbitrary five five meter blocks as if he's peering around the corner and we start blasting.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:22]** And then when we start blasting, they they'll come towards a blast and maybe I don't know.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:26]** But maybe they'll try to go around, in which case we should probably block that off.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:31]** But then where do we spend all that money or scrap on getting this?

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** I don't know how I feel about this plan.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** We've already come this far, I think.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** That's a great idea, Treme.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** Let's go with it, as you said.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** I just don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** So should we be hiding in one of these...

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Rooms in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:47 - 00:55:00]** Chalk runs out of story to tell and the comms open up and Tez finally overcomes and pushes the button and says, my patience is running very thin.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** Get that door open now.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** And you hear, clang, clang, right as she orders that.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Take your final positions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** I don't think we should back ourselves into a small space.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** We shouldn't back ourselves into a corner.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** We should leave ourselves options.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:21]** So why don't we camp out in the hallways, right?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Perhaps back here.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** There's four different directions we can go.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:33]** He points to the hallway that is in between this decoy and goes further to the engine room in between.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** Jack has no idea that the story was playing over the intercom, so he just comes sprinting out.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Guys, I'm out of story.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** I got to the end of the movie.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** What are we going to do?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** What are we going to do?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** What are we going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:51]** I can see the decoy, and I can potentially do cover fire or something.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** Chuck, we're about to have company of the unfriendly kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Nothing me and my puck can't handle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Amen to that.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Just start thrusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** You're a pernicious little vine, aren't you?

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Is that where you're staying?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Is this it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:18]** Well, just last check, where is everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** We're all in the same hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** Yeah, we're all in the same hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** So you guys have come out of the lab.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:31]** You're now just south of the study room and the computer room.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** And you're kind of in the barricade.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:40]** I've set two panels of probably computer gauges and meters and stuff.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:45]** Um, and that opening there kind of zigzags into the main hallway that heads out the stellar flare.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:51]** So in that main hallway, you guys put a frag grenade, um, right at the scanner opening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** No shrapnel bar shrapnel.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** And then the frags by the, uh, behind the drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Sorry.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:03]** Shrapnel first, then the drone, then there's a frag grenade and the frag grenade is also proximity switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** Yes.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** Okay.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Two proximity switches.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:11]** And then you get to... Did you have... Yeah, I had... You had three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Three to begin... Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** I had three total plus the one... So, no, no, no.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Right.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** I had four...

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** There was the third one.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:20]** I have one left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Okay.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** That's all I really needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** There's still the one with the flash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** Right around the corner at the end of that hallway.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:35]** And you put the decoy kitty corner from that on this side of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Okay.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:43]** And then you four now are gathered just on the opening after the zigzag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** And Rolo has line of sight on that hallway.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Same.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** First line of sight.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Scanning the sectors, guys.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Keep your sectors clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:57]** And you hear Tez Tronin say, Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** And there's a loud BOOM!

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:16]** as the first explosion, and then a loud metal clang, clang, clang, clang, echoes through the empty corridors as the metal doors into the Stellar Flare fall to the ground, followed by thump of bootsteps and priming of weapons.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** The airlock door has been breached, and they're coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Here they come.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Weapons out, spells ready.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Here we go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:31]** So before we go any further, I need initiative order from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** I got an 18.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** 13 for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** 13 for Chuck.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Thaddeus, you said seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Yes.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** And Rolu, what was yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:50]** Sorry, my data pad with my initiative bonus is being very slow here.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:50]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Five.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:51 - 00:59:14]** five five total great uh cool cool cool cool give me one second just to sort range this is like the tense moment where we're just waiting for footsteps there's like gunfire and then we're just waiting we're like expecting somebody around every corner it's cool uh termay you're you're up first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:17]** I'm going to ready an action.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:24]** I'm going to provide, I believe it's harrying fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Okay.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** You're going to ready a harrying fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:38]** So if I see movement in this hallway, I want to try and draw that enemy with my harrying fire kind of and provide a buff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:44]** So first, the true warrior, the first movement you, I guess you kind of see, you kind of have a slim view.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** You're the only one that could see it.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** You see there's a true warrior standing there right at the outside of the scanner.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** And you see a bunch of bodies behind him.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:59]** And you see a Yosuke kind of scramble past him.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:03]** And he runs through the scanner and he steps on that proximity switch.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** And there's no kind of save for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:11]** I guess it'd be the grenades reflex for the, for the perception of the, like to set it off.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Or are you talking about he triggered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:16]** I'm going to say he already triggered it.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Okay.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** So then it's just going to be the reflex save from that.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** I'll just read what it says.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** This cruel grenade propels exceptionally jagged shrapnel, causing lasting pain.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]** Affected creatures that fail their reflex saves against this grenade take the listed damage.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:41]** As long as they take any damage from the grenade, the shrapnel also impedes them per the embed weapon critical hit effect.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:54]** Both these grenades' sadistic effects and their common use by slavers to immobilize victims have resulted in wide-scale bans of these weapons, though more lawless regions rarely regulate explosives.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:59]** I think it's a DC-12 is what it's telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** And I pass that with a 17.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** So first we'll do that.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** So roll your damage for the shrapnel grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** So I got two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Okay.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** So I get half that.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** So I take one point of damage.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Great.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:21]** And he's little and nimble, so he shakes his way out of it and somehow dodges this shrapnel grenade.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:33]** But as he does that, it triggers the turret, and the turret goes and drops from the ceiling and starts mowing down everyone.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** So when they go through this...

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** Starting with your decoy.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** Because it is in the line of sight for this thing.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Just barely.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:48]** And so the decoy is going to take 3d6 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** I didn't think that would be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** You said it was peeking around the corner, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:01]** Right, but is it sight-based?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Yeah, it's sight-based.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** It's a two-hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** No, no, no.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:09]** But the mechanism to fire upon the decoy is sight-based?

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** It's got a camera?

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Or is it heat, like FLIR?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** FLIR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Site-based.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** It's a camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:17]** So it works in the dark, though.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** Or it doesn't work in the dark, is what you're telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** I think you're overcomplicating this.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** It hits it.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:27]** Right, but if it has dark vision... It has dark vision of 60 feet, and it sees its thing.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** It's going to hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Whatever.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** It destroys it.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** Shreds your decoy.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:40]** And then it's going to twist and turn 180 degrees, and it's going to...

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Natural 20.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** I'm not even going to bother calculating that.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:48]** The first, the Yosuke just dodged through the grenade.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** Driven up the center of it.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** Next, the tough warrior behind it.

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:03]** That hits and it's going to be...

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** 10 points of damage for that true warrior.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Next, Yusoki.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** Dude, this thing is decimating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Yeah.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:31]** And that true warrior is not... I figured it would also do work on... Ten points well spent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:36]** And then lastly, there's actually that true warrior is not seen.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:41]** And then there's one more true warrior outside that's in the line.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** That hits...

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** For nine points of damage.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:07]** The problem is it buzzes through all that and then it goes and turns off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:10]** And that's our game.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** I was waiting.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** I was waiting for that to come through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** Well, it was a wise setup.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:22]** It was worth it for the first two enemies, three enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** Yeah, that was good.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]** That was good.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:35]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
