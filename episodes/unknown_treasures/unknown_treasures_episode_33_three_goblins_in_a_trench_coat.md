**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Bob Burnquist.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** Bob Burnquist.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** That's my Tony Hawk skater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Is that Tony Hawk?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** I don't know where I got that from.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Yeah.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Oh, Tony Hawk.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** That was such a formative experience for me.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** I loved that game.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** It was X Games.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** Oh, I remember the X Games.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** X Games 2004.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Yeah, that was really good.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:47]** Bob Burnquist threw down the most ridiculous vert performance I think I've ever seen.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:55]** Bert as in like the vertical as in 900 or something like a vert ramp, like the U shaped the opposite of horizontal Bert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** So like, don't forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** He did.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:02]** He, I remember he went up one wall, went to do a kick flip.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:11]** So a kick flip to Indy is when you go off the wall, you flip the board with your front foot, you grab it and you throw it down on the, on the ramp and you ride it back down.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:21]** but he under rotated and grabbed the board upside down and just like threw up a prayer, threw it down and it flipped just perfectly.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It was wild.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** The whole run was insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** That's rad.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:27]** Was that the, that was the fakie 900 or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Okay, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** No, I've never seen Bob pull off 900.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** He was the first one.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Tony Hawk was the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Yeah, Tony Hawk pulled off the fake 900.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** What's the fake?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** So you went goofy, basically.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Oh.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Switch, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I'll admit that I can't even do an Ollie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:44 - 00:03:08]** yeah backwards yep it's been a long time since i've boarded yeah i i've tried a lot to do an ollie and i still can't and i would love to cross it off my list teacher yeah it'd be awesome i don't even want to learn no cool all right well cool my my uh my neighbor across the street we're gonna cut you bob then we're gonna bring kev back so oh i'm kev's been back bob didn't exist he's not real


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** What?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** Man, you were just that good of an actor.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** He's just a CGI skater in the 90s.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** I was convinced.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** No, my neighbor right across the street, Mark Fields, if you're listening, shout out to you.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** You're an amazing man.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:28]** He was able to do like Ollie over eight boards because they would like stack the boards up kind of back to back.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** And he was able to do like eight boards high or something ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** You stack them on trucks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:36]** No, you stack them like side by side, like on the side, and then you kind of alternate them.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** Yeah, so they go truck, truck, truck.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Okay.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** He is an amazing man.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** He was able to do like, I think it was like six or eight, and I was like,

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** It's a lot.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Yeah, it was a lot.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** It's like the size of me.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:47]** He was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** He was very good.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** And he probably could have gotten pro.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** I mean, I know a couple.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** I know a couple pro skaters.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Mark Fields.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Skater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** He's not a skater right now.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** He's like a preacher now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Okay.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Okay.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** So he's not the linebacker.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Born in 1972.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** We were dealing with the whole like AI thing.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:34]** character building you know whatever joking stuff on on social medias you know like you use ai to like draw things i oh yeah i typed in just kevin decker uh but apparently there's a there's a linebacker or somebody or quarterback or something that's like that was named kevin decker and that's all the ai spit out was like an ugly football player it's like well at least i look better than that

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:39]** I'm not as rich as that guy is, but I can sleep better at night.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** There are some things money can't buy.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** That's mean.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Cut that.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Cut all that.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Just make his looks look better.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** He listens.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** He's going to stop listening to the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:53]** I do want to ask if anyone else knows their name doppelganger.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:58]** And I'll start by saying that mine isn't the Australian journalist.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:07]** who was in a meme where he was interviewing Trump, and he reads off something, or he hands something to Trump to read off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:11]** I remember that article came out, and it was like, John Swan, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** And I was like, no way.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** Then I looked it up, and I was like, that's not my John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:21]** I don't have quite a doppelganger.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** But I don't know if this counts.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Let me know.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** No, no, no.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:38]** There was an episode of NCIS Los Angeles where there was a hacker named William Garrett who was busted for, like, doing something crazy, of course.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** I don't know, whatever.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Chaos ensued, right?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:49]** But they put his, like, ID up on the screen, and it also looked sort of like me.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Wow.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Wait, I got to find this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:50 - 00:06:14]** it's on my it's on somewhere on social media i gotta find it it could also be the case that there's no doppelganger for you because there can be only one it was only yeah so yeah exactly i mean so just the listeners don't know this but like will's wi-fi is the last time yeah i am right so the description on ncis fandom is

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:43]** is brief but powerful it is literally william garrett is a man period that's the description okay mysterious as always will kevin kevin deckers season five episode unwritten rule yeah there's so many kevin deckers there's a baseball player a football player the number one is coastal life realty group i'm none of these sounds just like multiverse versions of you i know that could have been


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:47]** What I really need is the first thing to pop up is Kevin Decker of WillSave.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** That's what I want.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** That's my dream, my life goal.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** Help me reach it, if you're listening to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Oh, if I look up my own name, let's see.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** I just typed in Kelly's name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** You should Google.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Kelly Gillette, what'd you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Yeah.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** Type in Kelly Gilliam's name to Google.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** I was using DuckDuckGirl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** How do you spell Kelly Gilliam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Let me do it.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** I'll do it.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** Well, then maybe... Because I don't like to get gaslit.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:14]** I'm pretty sure it's not... Oh, my God.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** None of these things are good.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** Why would you lead with... Oh, no.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** My face is there.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Oh, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** I'm on the front images of Google.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** Wait, how do you spell... I spelled Kelly wrong.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** That's fine.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** You can't see my screen yet, but you should do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Look at this.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** The will save is being repped.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** That's not what my Google's showing.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Whoa.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** This is a California search, I guess, Kevin.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** He showed up on Google search.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Maybe.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** It's like location-based.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yeah.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** I'm sorry.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** No, because it shows up for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** Kevin hates me, apparently.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** He blocked me on all searches.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:24]** He's like, please exclude always Kelly Gilliam in the search.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** I see your GitHub and your Ricochet360.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I haven't committed to GitHub in years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** I just want to be Google famous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** I'm on GitLab now.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** I see you're linked in.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** GitLab is the way to go, guys.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Just FYI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:46]** I'm just surrounded by a bunch of women, of course, and they're all blonde and s*** naturally.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** All the Kellys out there.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:58]** You're also – there's one picture of a man and – or just a couple, like a man and a woman.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Kip Winger and Kelly Gilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Is he wearing a KISS shirt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:04]** And the man just looks like –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:29]** the villain before his origin story he's like he's like a skunk stripe white stripe does yeah he's got a skunk stripe for sure he does look like a batman villain for real though and that's his wife that like dies smile yes oh yes his name is kip apparently according to oh i die to pinterest oh it says kip winger and kelly gillian beautiful kelly hot if only

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:12]** Vinny's got a long way to go before he's on Google, though, because number one is Vinny Rodriguez III, who is an American stage television actor on the CW for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** Vicente Rodriguez, Spanish former soccer player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** Yep.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** So that's my real doppelganger, Vicente Rodriguez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** You're not going to be V-Rod?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** V-Rod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Although I suck at soccer.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:30]** William Garrett III, Lieutenant General in the United States Army, is actually just me, like, 40 years from now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Right.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:37]** You could also, like, hack it and get him, like, lowered down in the Google.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** I'm going to.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** That's funny.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** I actually put him up just to throw off the scent.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** Hold on.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Look at the scent from who?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** John Swan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:51]** As fun as that is, I think it's actually more important for us to get famous on Will Save playing Starfinder.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Okay.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** So let's play.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Okay.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Here we go.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Let's die.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Oh, Jack.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** I'm so sorry, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Yeah, sorry, Jack.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** No, John, don't die.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** You guys want a moment of silence for Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** He's not dead yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Well then, let's get into it.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** He's not dead yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:18]** So last time, we got back into the final battle of the mid-zone.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:40]** Asashla went after Torme but missed Thaddeus ran away again Torme used brave words on a dead goblin to try to get Asashla to try to sway Asashla but she saw right through it Chak got into a good position and took a shot at Asashla took her down to 1 HP you didn't know that but that's how close she was

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** And then Bomb Gozzle turned around and finished her off.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:51]** And you all took a round to try to settle out Bomb Gozzle and figure out his next move, but it's clear that Bomb Gozzle is just a zealot fighting for truth.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** And his chuck was zealot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:59]** Your grammatical knowledge in the last episode was quite good, but pronunciation and vocabulary needs some work.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** But that's a theme, though.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:09]** If Kevin... And with that... Zealot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** So Bob Guzzle takes a shot of chalk.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** And chalk is down.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Chalk is down.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** So let's get back over to the map.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** I'm going to just drag this little tab thing here.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Here we go.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** And we're back on the map.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** To the map.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** And we're on round... Shoot, I didn't mark where we were.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Baby, look at the map.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** Oh, Bob Guzzle moved last, right?

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** baby come back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** Like was what Vinny said last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** That's easy.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** I think we're at the bottom of round number seven, maybe, possibly.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** Von Gazel just shot.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Again?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Okay, cool, dope.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:58]** So Thaddeus kind of like strolls out from behind the dead carcass of Sashla, hoping to like threaten him.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:03]** He just kind of like, you know, like the spurs on his boots go ksh, ksh, ksh.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** I wish he had spurs on his boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Wah, wah, wah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** Oh, he's not.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** Actually, he's not going to move because he can't do that.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** And then, oh, no, he already reloaded.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Yeah, never mind.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:18]** He's going to move and then he's going to shoot her, shoot Bomb Gossel in the head.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** So here we go.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:26]** That's a, it's a six to hit, which I'm guessing doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Oh, let me do some math.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Yeah, do some math.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Was that a Venom round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** No, it wasn't.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I'm really sad now.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Why are you so sad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Why?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** No one's hitting Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** We cleaned up the Space Goblin so easily in threefold.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** I'm kind of annoyed right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** Dude, they're hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** No, they're not.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** He's hard.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Are they?

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** Maybe we just got super lucky last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** He's also tough.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:59]** Well, it's top of round number eight, possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Roloo, what are you going to do?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Good question.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:22]** I think Roloo is just acting with pure... Roloo, there's a fierce intensity in his eyes as he's recounting just the inability to see that Bob Goswell was this zealot who just absolutely would not back down.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I thought you guys corrected me.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** No, we're going to go with zealot.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** I think from now on, it's Z-Lot.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Yeah, it's Z-Lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** I learned Z-Lot.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:36]** It's because I played StarCraft, and there were Z-Lots on there, and that's how I pronounced Z-Lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** Did they say Z-Lot, though, in the audio?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** No.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** They didn't have audio back then, because I'm old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:57]** Anyway, Rolo is upset that he was not able to identify that and not able to pull through and actually hit last time to just really, you know, throw a bomb guzzle off and actually do some damage.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** So Rolo's going to do a full action.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:02]** Two shots with the azimuth serpent laser.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** First shot is a 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** And match goes to the roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Yes, Ty goes to the roller.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** It's going to be seven points of fire damage from the first shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Boom!

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:22]** That is the first damage that Bomb Gozzle has taken all this fight.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** This whole time, and Roloo didn't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** But what's good is that Roloo just rolled a natural 20.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:33]** Retribution runs cold in his veins.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:58]** gonna do the deck chalk call it chalk call it stop stop stop that's fine i wanted chalk to call it because he's the dead one but he couldn't respond because he's dead he couldn't chalk what are you saying that's what i thought cast great words hurry amazing uh oh cool bonus effect the target is the uh yeah the target is off target for one round

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** Off target.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:00]** I'm going to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:05]** That's minus two to attack rolls, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Yes.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:14]** And I'm going to roll 4d4, which is a strong 12 points of fire damage from the second shot.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** That's a lot of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** That is 19 points of damage.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Holy ****.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:23]** So he went from not being hit to being pretty well damaged.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:30]** So you go with one shot and you just clink him and part of his shoulder goes off.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:34]** And then you go with a second shot and it hits him like dead in the chest.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:41]** And like metal chunks go flying everywhere and a piston actually shoots off into nowhere.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** Steam's coming out.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Shh, but he is still standing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** You made the wrong choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Torme, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:56]** I'm going to seeing bomb guzzle on the field still.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** What do you think?

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:06]** I was going to throw a grenade, but I'm just going to cast misfire again.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:09]** And then hopefully you fail.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** And then maybe I'll maneuver somewhere else.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:20]** And it's a 13 DC cause my 14 on the, I had an eight on the die.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** We'll say you have a, for what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** 14.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:32]** We'll say, we'll say, Chuck, what are you doing?

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Let's talk about death.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** How close are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** Chuck is unstable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Let's talk about death, baby.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** Let's talk about you and Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** Is Bomb Gozzle going to die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah, most likely.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:53]** Probably by the next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Technically speaking, Chalk is dying.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:05]** I can spend one quarter of my RP, minimum one, to stabilize, which I think I will do.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:12]** Fun fact about long-term stability that I did not know until I just read these couple of paragraphs from the core rulebook.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** Basically, every hour, you've got to make a con save.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** Every hour, you're stable, but zeros.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** You've got to make a con save.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Zero to nine, you're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:28]** You make a con, but if you don't get over a nine, you instantly die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** It's a death.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** Yeah, we talked about it in an episode some time ago, and it's a bad thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** It's not good.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** 10 to 19, you're stable.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** You check again in another hour.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** 20 or higher, you get one HP and return to consciousness.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** So I'm going to spend one resolve point to stabilize myself.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:52]** And then hopefully the next round I can use at the beginning of my turn, stay in the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** I thought you do stabilize at the end of technically your last turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** So you stabilize this round and the next round you get to do stay in the fight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:06]** Because Bumguzzle's turn was right after mine, I don't have to do anything until the end of my turn.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Okay.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** The turn that I get knocked unconscious.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** So, on my turn, I spend a resolve point to stabilize.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:19]** I can spend a resolve point to stay in the fight, but it happens very explicitly at the beginning of your turn.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Yeah.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:23]** Since that's already passed, I have to wait until my next turn in order to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Okay.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Whatever you say.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** So, just to clarify, your entire turn was just staying alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:34]** Are you at one point or you're at zero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** You're at zero but not dying.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Still zero, just no longer dying.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Not for the next hour at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** I think I follow.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** I think we're on the same page there.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** But it's Bomb Guzzle's turn.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:50]** So would Bomb Guzzle recognize that you did that?

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** He's just going to assume you're dead.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** Is that going to be a wisdom save of some sort?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** Probably be a perception check.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Probably life science.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** I don't think he's going to bother with that.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:07]** I think he's going to go a full round attack against Roland.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:10]** All right.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Let me do that.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** I'm going to roll some dice here.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** That is a 23 on the first shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Yep, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** And a 22 on the second shot.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Weirdly, that also hits.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** I don't know if that one hits.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Yeah, it's really weird.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** No?

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** No?

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Yeah, it's weird.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Just checking.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** Super weird, but it's a lot of nature stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** These 20s things are pretty hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** Kind of iffy.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Wait, sorry, sorry.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** I do have a minus two to attacks, so take two off of those.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** So I'm at actually 19 and 20.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** Is that right?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** No, sorry.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** 21 and 20.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** 21 and 20?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Still hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Okay, still hits.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:48]** We're level two, you know.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:53]** Let me spin my tiny little D8 here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** Circular peg, circular hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** That first shot is nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** Okay.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Circle gets the square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Cool.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Yep.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Yep.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** The second one is 10 points of damage for a total of 19.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** So he just, he looks at Chuck and he goes, ah, that f***ed up.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** And then, sorry, ah, that f***ed up.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:16]** And then moves to the other one and he points at Rolo and he goes, choo, choo, choo.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** And shoots at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:26]** From Thaddeus and Torme's position, you probably see Bomb Guzzle take the shots and Rolu gets hit.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** And then Rolu falls to their knees and falls face first on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Are you f***ing kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** Rolu is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Oh no.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** D***.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** If we get taken out by a space goblin, I'm going to be pissed off.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** This is not right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** That's harsh.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** I don't know.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Maybe Thaddeus didn't run away.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Shut up, Kevin.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** I'm just saying.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** But it's Thaddeus' turn, so this is his opportunity to make it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:55 - 00:22:01]** So just saying, Vahri and small goblin guy and, you know, shy Akeshdi guy.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** I can't remember your names.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** You get a move action and a standard action.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Shooting is considered a standard action.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** What is your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:39]** I'm going to throw Healing Serum at Shock because I don't think he has them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** But he can't, he's... He's conscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** He's not a monster.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** No, he's stable.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** He's stable.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** He's not conscious.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** He's stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** He's not conscious.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** He's throwing it at an unconscious person.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** And Rolu's down?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** Rolu is unconscious and dying.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** Okay.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** All right.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:02]** Thaddeus is like, you know, he's like, he's like looking at, he's going to roll to see how weak this mother trucker is.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** How close to death, you know.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** You doing a life science check for that?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** Yeah.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** Yeah.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** That's what I'm going to do.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** All right.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:08]** That's 18.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** He's about halfway there.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** I don't like this.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Living on a prayer.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Good lord, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:23]** Is this now a competition to see how many classic rock tunes we can record?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Dude, I'm down.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:29]** That has become our pre-show rock out playlist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** He's at 17 hit points.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** That's very specific.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** Thank you.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:39]** Look, I haven't slept in a long time in real life.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:44]** Sorry about the questions, but I want to heal Rolude.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** If I just put a serum in Rolu, is he going to be fine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:50]** It is a full action to heal somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** Shut up, Rolu.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Don't get the wrong idea, okay?

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** Yeah, what were you saying, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:00]** Uh, it's a full action to heal somebody who is... And then he'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** He'll get back up and can do things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** True, yes, but it's a full action and you're not within range.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** I'm not, yeah.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You can't possibly do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** You can't do it, yeah.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** All right.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:12]** All right, well, Thaddeus... Okay, so Thaddeus... Thaddeus is going to heal Rulu.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** He has to.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Rulu's just too powerful.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:20]** So, like, he's going to do this and then he's going to take a defensive stance or whatever the f*** it's called because I don't ever do this.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** He's going to try to reduce damage as much as possible.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:49]** fight defensively fight defensively yeah so you moved this remove action standard action to fight i moved right behind rolu because i have to admit he can pack a punch because he's very swole and like yeah so i'm gonna fight defensively which gives me he hits the roll it's like magical cheating stuff but whatever and then like lean lean swole whatever rolu whatever

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:59]** all right so he's gonna like he died i think he counts his mac stop talking about i'm not thaddeus isn't comfortable with what he admitted just now he this is a big freaking step for him okay

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:03]** All right, so basically, like, all right, fighting defensively, how much of a bonus does that give me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Anyone, sorry.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** Plus, it's minus four penalty to attacks and plus two bonus to AC.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:11]** All right, he's just going to prepare to get shot at.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:16]** You can, I didn't realize, I was mistaken, total defense is a standard action.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:21]** So that is a plus four bonus to armor class, and that's it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** You defend yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** All across armor classes.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** Okay, cool.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** EAC, KAC, and so on.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:36]** And just so you're aware, because I know it gets confusing, but Rolu does no longer provide soft cover for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** I know, I know.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** Even though he's... Because he's on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** He's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** I mean, look...

**[00:25:42 - 00:26:11]** here's here's here's couldn't really hide behind roly's dead body spoiler alert but uh all right i'm ready i'm ready for whatever comes next with my plus four that's the end of your turn that's all i could do really and that's the end of round number eight wow this is a long long long combat but there's only two of you left so it shouldn't take much longer uh roly what are you doing is it roly's turn just dying i'm just asking like what are you just hanging around yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:12]** Stabilize.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** I'm going to use an RP to stabilize.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:14]** Okay.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** Treme, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:24]** Treme is a little annoyed that this dude has taken out his two crewmates.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:49]** really upset about this this is not how i was supposed to uh spend today we were supposed to get this junk and just get the f out of here but now we have to fight this freaking goblin king whatever dude and uh he's just really enraged and um he starts muttering to himself and as he's muttering to himself like he's sort of like

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:57]** portals start opening up what then all of a sudden magic missiles yes nice do it do it pour out

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:02]** And I'm going to argue that I can use three as a full round action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** I'm going to have to take a challenge flag on that.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Start the timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** We can ask the rules lawyers, the rules paralegals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** I'm starting them.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** I'm starting the minute timer.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** And here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** This is supposed to be just like Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:21]** It says limited by two, though, in your racial ability.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:26]** And that would trump your likability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:49]** um i don't think it says i don't think you're giving fair reading to what it actually says because i think it says i'm trying to look it up right now alien where's my alien archive card copy i'm gonna look at the pdf 30 seconds we're ready for the listeners i have been holding up an iphone with a stopwatch going

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:58]** I can't find my Alien Archive PDF, which is really the worst part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:03]** I already had it pulled up, and I forgot, and now it's reloading, and my screen is being dumb and slow.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Five seconds left.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Force Bolt.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:14]** Which words can cast Magic Missile as a spell-like ability once per day for Magic Missiles that are caught, absorbed, using an ability, blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Kev, what is your ruling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Ah, you're...

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** I thought there was a limit somewhere in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** It does say.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** I think it's on catching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** The rules are paralegal.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Jeremy's typing.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Okay.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** All right.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:29]** The ref grants an extension for the rules are paralegal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** Call from the box came down.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Call from the box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** We need a decision from New York.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** Give me a moment to read their stat block is what he said.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:43]** If you would like to join the Will Save Discord, you can go to the Will Save Twitter and click on the tab link and then get on the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:47]** If you want to debate rules when we're recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Twitter, tab link, Discord.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** That's the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** You can get the rules.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** It's the tag rules paralegal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Yeah, the tag rules paralegal.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** You can join the rules paralegals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Yep.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** Get your own channel and everything.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:07]** It's a good way to fight the evil of Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:12]** Fight all evil GMs wherever they may be.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Bob Burnquist.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** It's good, man.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** It's like the balance of power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:22]** As he slides on his board down a rail.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:26]** As a former member of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Really short run.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** You should have picked a name of not an actual person, Kev, so we could put him in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Okay, hold on a second.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** I didn't realize it was an actual name, but I said it.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** I'm sorry.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Kevin, in the Discord.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** You didn't know who Bob Perkins was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** It's definitely there in my memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** This is important.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Kevin's doing some weird shit here in the Discord.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** He's not mentioning...

**[00:29:47 - 00:30:11]** term a side of the story here so will you need to get into the discord and like give your own oh my god because kevin's just like yeah two two missiles two missiles you just keep saying that over and over i never said two don't worry my you just said for every two magic yeah but like i don't know we need to explain how many i literally said how many missiles can a witch word shoot not catching anything which could and then my next comment was literally a copy and paste of force bolt what are you talking about what am i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** misleading the jury.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** I just feel like Will should be able to argue his case.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:22]** Our ability to use the timer as we've talked about before.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** We are so good at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I'm going to let you roll forward.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:29]** I'm going to say if you do it as a full action because it says Forcebolt is like Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Grumpus is typing now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** As long as we cut it down to two minutes, we're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Okay, so what is the ruling now?

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** So can I do three?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** He stopped typing.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Grumpus was typing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** He was.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** No, I don't know.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Well, Kev, you made a ruling.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Jeremy, you didn't come back fast enough.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** We love you.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Oh, wait.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Jeremy's typing.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** I'm ignoring... You're in real time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** I'm ignoring absorb force because that is the catching process for...

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:09]** Force Bolt says, which words can cast Magic Missile as a spell-like ability once per day for every two Magic Missiles caught using its absorbed force?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** That's when I can do it additional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:22]** You can do an additional Force Bolt, which makes me question all the stuff we did earlier, but as it is right now, this round... I think that was above the board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** It was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Oh, guess what, Jeremy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Jeremy confirmed...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Three bolts!

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Thank you, Jeremy.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** This is the way to think about it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I will agree to that.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** It is Magic Missile.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** It is Magic Missile.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** You're right.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** I'm sorry.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** I thought there was some stipulation saying there was only two.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Go for it.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Full round.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Three Magic Missiles.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Full round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Magic Missile.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** 3d4 plus three.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Oh, that's a four on the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** It's a four.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** On the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** No, no.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** On my first D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Oh, Grumpus confirmed, too.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Oh, man.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** This is so good.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** This is a good day.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** All right.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Just f*** up the space goblin, please.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** I love magic missiles.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** I really miss being a caster.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** Thank you for the RTR, the real-time ruling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** All right.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:10]** The total damage was... I had two fours and a three.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:14]** So that's 11 points from... Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** So the first... Fourteen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Fourteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Oh, he's almost dead.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** Four, a three, and a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Whoa.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** Three points away from dead.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Three points away from dead now.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** Suck it.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** We can do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I love that you're keeping track of that, Kelly.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Thank you for telling me, man.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** I'm so appreciative.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** You rolled for it.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** You deserve it.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Thanks, man.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** But it's the end of your turn.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** Because that was a full round.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Because you're down and dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** Chuck's down, dead, and dirty.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:44]** At the start of his turn... I thought Chuck was stable.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** He was stable.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Stable's dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** He was not conscious.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** You're dying, but you're stably dying?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** You're still dying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** You're not... So there's dead, there's dying, and there's stable.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Stable means you're unconscious.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:05]** You're stable for... If nothing else happens, you're stable for the next hour, and then you roll again to see if you stay stable, you die, or you come back to life with one hit point.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Right, so you're at the pearly gates, and that's dying, right?

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** And then stable is you're waiting for the bus back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Yeah.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Things can still happen.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** Just saying.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** So you are going to spend one RP to stay in the fight.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** I get one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Mark that down.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** One hit point for Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Dude, finally, Chalk's back up.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Player three has entered the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** So that's minus two.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** I get one hit point.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** It's a move action to stand up.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Nope, that's not it.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** That's the opposite of what I wanted to do.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** I put a red X on my character.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** What?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** I might get a X if I keep coughing like that.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Oh, please don't.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Yeah, don't die, man.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:49]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Please don't die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:54 - 00:34:02]** If you're firing a ranged weapon from prone, you get a bonus to attack, don't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Just looking that up.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Just looking that up.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** You get a plus four bonus to your AC against ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** If you die, you drop your weapon, so you have to use a move action to pick it back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** Sure, so I'm going to use a move action to pick it up, and then I'm going to shoot him with it.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** There's no bonus to your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** You just have a better AC against ranged attacks.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** But a penalty against melee attacks.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:27]** I see your disappointment, and I had that same disappointment in threefold as Rick.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:30]** I was like, I'm going to drop prone and do all sorts of cool things.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** And I was like, this is stupid.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** Well, depends on the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** Depends on if you're being charged in combat or if you're sniping at somebody.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Or being sniped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:45]** Yeah, I don't think running away is going to do me anything because Bomb Guzzle is going to try to kill him either way.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** I think so.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** And I expect the range on that blaster is decent.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** So let's let the dice decide.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Let's make another wisdom check.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** That's a four.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** I'm fired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** I was going to say, like, you rolled, so you're going to fire.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:01]** But I was going to say, like, if you want to try to bluff that you're still dead, Bomb Guzzle wouldn't even notice.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I'll do a perception against your bluff.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** But go ahead and shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** So anyway, I started blasting.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Amazing.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Nice.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** I love it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** So I started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** That's an 18 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Yeah.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Let's go.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** KAC of 17.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** So it's definitely a hit.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** If you say three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Please be more than three.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Please be more than three.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Yo.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** It's exactly three.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:42]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** Chalk is like intoxicated with power right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** We'll have to pay the price for this later, I'm sure.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:54]** Chalk is the new leader of the trash hunters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** He goes...

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** And just immediately grabs his gun and pulls the trigger.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** And it hits Bob Gosling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Here we go, here we go, here we go.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** He, like, gasps up.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:07]** He picks up his blaster and, like, shakily raises it to his eyes.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** And as he's looking down the sights, he says, Fort Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Nope, say it again.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Say it again in Chuck's voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:26]** He's looking down the sights and he says, Fort Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:47]** and that round it hits him right across the neck but like not his fleshy neck the machine and it explodes

**[00:36:48 - 00:37:11]** and you just see oranges and reds and smoke and fire and flame like a michael bay flick yes yeah uh-huh i just watched american psycho again and like the the scene with the shootout with the cops and he's like even like him as a character he shoots it with his pistol and like the cop car explodes and he looks at his gun like yeah that that's not how this works

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:16]** But yes, Michael Bay, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Fireworks in the background.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:24]** And the entire machine, like, Bomb Gozzle's face drops flat.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:29]** The machine just falls forward, smashes into the ground.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:37]** And now that both Asashla and Bomb Gozzle are defeated...

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:43]** A feeling of anticipation descends over the rest of midfield, or midzone.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:49]** The collection of members of the Trash Hunters and the Unbrewed mutter to one another about what just transpired.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:57]** The Akestis and Space Goblins standing ready to continue the fight, waiting to see what the other side is going to do.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Who's going to make the next move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:03]** Guys, guys, I think we just destabilized a local government.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** All in a day's work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** He suddenly notices that Rolu isn't moving and is face down.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** Because Rolu went unconscious after check did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Yeah.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** Thaddeus gets down on his knee and sighs.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** He's like, all right.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:26]** And like injects healing serum to Rolu.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** He's reluctant.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Well, I mean, he's not reluctant.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** It's complicated, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** F***ing Rolu.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Rolu.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** Rolu's eyes open.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** He looks to the right.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** He sees Jack.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** Jack, I'm... I'm glad you're up.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** Thank you for saving me with a healing serum.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** That was very nice of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** I can see Thaddeus.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Thaddeus, what are you doing here?

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Oh, nothing.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** Totally not saving you with a healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** If anyone's going to kill you, it's going to be me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** My Thaddeus voice is getting worse and worse every episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** It's fine.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Thaddeus, can you at least help me up?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Your goblins are getting better.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:09]** Rolo holds up a hand for Thaddeus to pull him up.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** God dang it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:15]** Thaddeus, like, coldly, like, just strides away.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:21]** As far as he knows, dude, you're not up to any good.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** But we need you for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:29]** Shakes his head and tries to clear the ringing from his ears and stands up and looks around.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Did we just overthrow a local government?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Yeah, this wasn't Operation Northwoods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** Shaq, you can brief the cop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** He's been asleep for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:44]** What are the... Are the Akishis and the goblins still just uneasily standing there?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** Are they just, like, staring aghast at, like, what happened, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Why don't you roll perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Just roller or everyone?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:52 - 00:40:15]** just roll it for now that's fine 13 perfect it's high enough because i didn't have a dc for that um so rolu rises you guys are all let me take a little x off your thing and let me remove this digital drawn on oh no i deleted the whole character how do i and i can't bring him back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Man-Z?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Man-Z doesn't work.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Oh, okay, that's fine.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Bomb Guzzle's gone.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Okay, imagine Bomb Guzzle's body's still there.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Because Bomb Guzzle's... Grave words?

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Do it, do it, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:43]** As Tremei walks up and reaches down to touch the chassis of Bomb Guzzle, Bomb Guzzle's chassis armor wiggles in.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:48]** and then cracks, and with a loud pop, and puffs of black smoke.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** And then Bomb Gozzle crawls out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** And then another goblin...

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Follows him on.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** For real.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** And then a third goblin crawls out.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Yes.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** Because there's three goblins in a mech suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Three goblins in a suit.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Finally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** They all stand up.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** But Bomb Gozzle stands up in front of them.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** And he's the tallest.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** All four feet of him.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** And he looks at each of you in the eye.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** Bomb Gozzle, see now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Trian's Tinkerton needed to fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** You, you are the chosen.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** And he turns away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Rolo steps up and says, wait.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Does Bomb Gozzle turn around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** No, Bomb Gozzle turns away.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:54]** But instead of walking away, instead of trotting off, Bomb Gozzle actually just bends over and looks at you through his legs.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** I was going to try to do this on video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Please don't.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** You don't need to.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** You're fine.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** No, please don't.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** I kind of want to see it.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** It's kind of interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** I don't want to see that.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** Nobody wants to see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Oh, hell, the junk lords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:09]** It's really inappropriate for you to wear pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** Oh, hell, the junk lords.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:40]** through his legs you see his face and he's shouting oh hey the junk lords and he's calling you the junk lords and in the distance you can see Akestis oh sorry the rest of the trash hunters turn and bend over in the same way and they all start repeating the phrase oh hey the junk lords oh hey the junk lords they're all bending over and looking at you through their legs and in the distance some of the Akestis wander off into the wastelands with their heads hung and their feet

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:49]** But if you remain, and those Akeshi's come and join the goblin chants, and they're all shouting, all hail the junk lords.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:54]** And that sound grows louder and louder, and you feel the pressure in the air.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** And the ground seems to shake with each word.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:03]** And you feel the rhythm of their song in your chest.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** All hail the junk lords.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:14]** All hail the Junk Lords.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** And you are bathed in their praise as you level up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** To three!

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Very nice.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:35]** Rulu strides over to Bomb Guzzle and stands five feet away.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:50]** and says, don't forget that it's not just Triune and the Junk Lords who you should revere and fear, but the three captains as well.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:54]** And Rulu kicks Baumgasl over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** What the f***, Rulu?

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Are you f***ing serious?

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Why?

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:01]** I guess so.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** doing that?

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** What did you do?

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Did you go to hell and come back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Why?

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** They're worshipping us.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:13]** Why did you... I mean, that's pretty harsh.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** I mean, even for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** This lord is lesser, perhaps.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** I don't know.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Rolo doesn't speak for all of us.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** I thought we should have said that earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** So let's just... No, let's play this out.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:30]** So let me copy and paste since I lost Bomb Gozzle and thank you to whoever... Are we gonna now have to kill Bomb Gozzle?

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:34]** Bomb Guzzle stands back up and takes a swing at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Rolo just takes a step back.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Are we in combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I think so.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** We're back in combat.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:43]** And that swing shoot is strength is zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Is he not in the mech suit anymore?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** No, he's not in the mech suit.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** He's not in the mech suit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Does an 18 hit, Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Yes, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** So he swings and he hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:00]** Wait, this isn't something... Did you guys script this ahead of time or did you just legit just go out of nowhere and kick this guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:06]** Rolu just felt like he was really pissed off at Shaq and just overcorrected.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** What did Shaq do?

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** No, not Shaq.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Rolu doesn't know anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** No, yeah.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** I guess he did go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Hey, all of you, you need to all just take a seat.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:22]** We don't need to... No more people need to die here today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Rollo's going to turn and walk away.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Get it together, Rollo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:32]** Bomb Guzzle reaches out and punches you, and he stands back up and he punches you, and he hits you for one point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:37]** What's really funny is Rollo was just down, and there's a very real chance that...

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Bob Gosselin would have knocked you the F word out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** This is a very even fight at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** What I was going to ask was how much he was healed by.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** I don't know how much he was healed.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Because I got a healing serum, right?

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Yeah, I didn't roll that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Let me roll that real quick.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Please don't roll one.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** No, it's fine.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** I'm kind of annoyed at Rolly right now, though.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Yeah, it's fair.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** You can be annoyed at me.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** It's fine.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** No, not you necessarily.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Necessarily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** That's what my character would do.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** That's what my character would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** No, no, no.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** I just hide behind Thaddeus for all my rage against John.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Yeah.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:11]** All right.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Here we go.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** You got seven points, you j*****s. There you go.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** You got seven back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** Well, you're down to six.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** What are you going to do?

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** We're just going to stay in because we never actually left initiative order, I guess, technically.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Thaddeus, it's now your turn.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** Thaddeus is going to like... All right.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** I just want to clarify.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** You said this in the name of the free captains, essentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Yeah, that's crazy, bro.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Like, you're crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** All right.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** You can't be saying that shit, Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** Thaddeus is going to try to tackle Rulu.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** I don't think this is going to work, but...

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Yeah.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** He's going to rush it, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** I think we're going to have to end up fighting all these people in.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Because they're going to see this thing and be like, these are no lords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** He's going to try to hold Rolu back slash tackle him or whatever.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** Because he just reaches around and goes, Rolu, cut it out, man.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** That's fine.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** This is how you represent all of us.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** You've lost it.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** The sun is gone to your head.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Relax.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Don't make me tell the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** So go ahead and roll me K, C plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** I would say Roloo willingly is grappled.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** He's fine.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Okay.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** He's not playing with me.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** There we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Now go sit down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** So are you voluntarily leaving combat?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** Yeah.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** He's not going to fight back.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Let's all relax.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** We have a job to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** All of the goblins at this point stop and stand up.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** And they were just like, they were devoting themselves to you.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** But you just showed that you weren't worthy.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** At least Roloo.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:48]** And Bob Gozzle is also, like, he's furious.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** He's standing there.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Well, I'll take you out of combat at this point.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:59]** Because Bob Gozzle is the only one that heard, like, in the name of the Free Captains, right?

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** So, like, this act of aggression was seen by the rest of them.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** But you were the only one that, like, he's the only one that heard you say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:10]** Look, everything is fine.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** It's hot.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** He's not from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** And he was knocked out clean.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** He doesn't like to feel weak.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** And he overreacted.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:24]** We want the same thing, so let's work together.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** And we all love Triune, don't we?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** We love Triune.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** We love Triune.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Not sure about him.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** Well, he'll take a nice time out, I promise you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** Jack steps up to the bomb guzzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Bomb, bomb, Guzzle.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** We've had our differences.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Lots of differences.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** We've exchanged blows.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** You have my respect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** And mine.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** He reaches out a nice paw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** Please forgive my friend here.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** I forgot to add the other two goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** Suddenly there were like 38 goblins on the call.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Literally surrounding us on the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** Those are just the other two goblins that got out of the mech suit.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** They just split off from each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Oh my god.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:19]** All right, so now we got a murder hobo, a bunch of goblins.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** Let's not put that in the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** Please forgive my friend's indiscretion.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:27]** He must have taken some head trouble when he hit the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Roll diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** You know how combat gets.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Things are said.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Roll what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:35]** Diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** 21.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** I rolled low, so I don't help.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** I don't help either.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** But Shaq rolled pretty high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** So tension's high.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:48]** Chak just moved him down a notch, for Chak at least.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Rolu, he's still uneasy about Rolu.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Doesn't know what's going on.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:59]** All the rest of the goblins, they're pulling their knives out and all their weapons pointing at you.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:05]** Let me take away a couple of the Akestis, because a couple of Akestis wandered off.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** So there's only about two Akestis left.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** But they're siding with the goblins at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Rolu, why don't you go see what's going on with the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Sure.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Rolu walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:27]** And as you start to walk away, there's an electronic pop from the direction of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:36]** The flickering force field around the wreckage winks out and Kesh and Merc emerge.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:41]** Wisps of smoking trails are actually still coming from Merc's goblin ears.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:46]** And Kesh actually steps forward from the crash stellar flare.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:51]** His arms raised, his scaly palms pointing toward everyone.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:57]** He pulls a small comm unit from his clothes and he speaks into it.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** His voice amplified across the entire mid zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Drash haunt us.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** I'm brewed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:16]** Working together, I, the goblin Junker Merc, and these outsiders have opened up the Great Wreckage.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** There will be no more fighting today.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:28]** In fact, this area will forever be a neutral zone where our people can settle disputes in peace.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** Kind of ironic given what Rolly just did.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Yeah.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:41]** But Merc nods vigorously in agreement and shoots some challenging glances at any of the trash hunters that try to challenge it, including Bumguzzle.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** And Kesh makes some calming gestures because clearly tensions are high.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:51]** And the crowd of goblins and the remaining of Keshies break into cheers.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** Praise Triune.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** All hail the Junk Lords.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Except Roloo.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** F*** that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** All hail the Junk Lords.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Yes.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Screw Roloo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Yes, Roloo sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Yeah, f*** that guy.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Yeah, we all.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Yeah, Roloo sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** I think he didn't like this place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:16]** So I think without... I was thinking about opening up an Airbnb here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:20]** That is on Zillow.com looking at... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Rolling socks land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** Is there a Redfin or is this a Zillow country?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:31]** I'm going to take out a couple more goblins as if they died during battle because there was a fighting going on.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Cool.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** So let's take you out of combat.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** I'm going to delete the dead bodies.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** We'll just move them off to the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:43]** You guys dragged... Just absorbed into the sand.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** You have sand taken back into itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** After 20 seconds, they fade away into nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Oh, but we didn't loot them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** I didn't make... Oh, loot!

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Yeah, we can talk about loot real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Loot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** We loot the bodies.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** In a respectful way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:07]** So as you're moving, Asashla, you can actually, the only thing on her is that ring that you guys noticed.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** You pull it off and it's actually a ring of resistance mark one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:17]** And then Bomb Gozzle is angry, but he sees you moving his chassis.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** You could repair that.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** It is a salvaged chassis.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I can show you that.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** And it has a mega junk laser on it.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** It has two batteries with 20 charges each.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:36]** Fun thing about that junk laser is if you roll one, it can turn into a bomb, and there's a lot of rules to that, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:36 - 00:54:01]** let me show you that that's cool i know he was he was running with it risky the whole time um so wait if you roll a one if you get a natural one that turns into a bomb it just blows up in your wait no there's rules about what it what actually happens so yeah let me wait john is that why in threefold when they were like it's not the same weapon that they had in threefold right where they're like hitting their guns like because it looked like they're about to explode any second


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:03]** That is a common theme among space goblins.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** So, like, they could just blow up.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:05]** Unstable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Their weapons, yeah, their weapons all turn into, yeah, the unstable, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Thank you.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Listen to Threefold Conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:21]** Basically, I'd have to, like, really read into it, but basically, like, you roll, once you find out whether it's, like, you roll a negative one, and you have to roll again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** It gets a timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Right.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** And if you roll, if you roll one, it blows up immediately.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** If you roll a six, you got some time to actually throw it at your enemy.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Um, but yeah, so I put them both up for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** It warns you that it's going to blow up as you're firing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** I think you just kind of guess you're like, um, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** So, Oh, this might have cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** Uh,

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Yeah, I think that's it.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** I think, like, he's settled nerves.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:55]** Whatever happened with Rolu and Bob Gossel's little... People are uneasy about it, but, like, it didn't destabilize the situation, right?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** No one died.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:15]** everybody still sides it's mostly chalk is the leader of this right he's the one that killed true noon or killed tinkerton so like he's the one that is the chosen the rest of you are his his like posse his you know his supporters so what do you guys want to do moving forward


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** What's your plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** Let's go in the thing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** I'm curious if any of us has engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Don't we get the secret?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Say again?

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:35]** Or like, oh, could I tap Merc and Cash to do some work on the salvage chassis for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:40]** Yeah, if you want to do the salvage chassis thing, we can figure that out.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Is it a heavy armor, though?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** It is medium armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Is it medium?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:51]** I didn't read it when I handed it to you.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** I'm reading it.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** It says size medium.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Okay.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:02]** I just think it might be dope, the picture of a freaking monkey plant in power armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Riding around in a junk mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** Go ahead, Kelly.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:10]** I was going to say, it might be good to sleep again if anyone needs to heal up.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Yeah.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** Roller, you should probably have a lie down and find your inner balance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** I don't even get touched in this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Be like Jermaine, kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:23]** You're right.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Yes, I should.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** You're off-key.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** That was out of character.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** I'm sorry.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** I grab the tent.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** I call the tent.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** I would have liked to use the tent.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** No, Rolo, you're in the doghouse right now, outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Eight-man tent.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** Yeah, you almost got us in another fight, Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** What'd you say, Kev?

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** It's an eight-man tent, and Thaddeus is, like, standing at the door, going, no, no, no, it's mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** It's mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Only two ways allowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Come on, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** And Merc and Kesha were like, what the f***, man?

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** They didn't do s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** They did nothing.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Orvari, for that matter.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** No, they were opening it up, right?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** They just did that now.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Anyway, I can take the first watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** So, Thaddeus, you're voting to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:35]** to rest because we don't know what we're going to find in this place you know rolo definitely has to rest yeah yeah check has one hit point and zero stamina so yeah yeah definitely definitely would like to take a long rest well i guess i'll take first watch and i'll also get your spell slots back get your health back find your balance yeah yeah

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** I got a little level up though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Jack sneaks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** To the level up first and then we can do the rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Worry about leveling up in our off time.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** We'll come back to that next episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Okay.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:55]** So I just want to clarify, you guys are saying you're going to, you're going to set up camp here and you guys are all posting watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** I'll watch first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** I'll watch second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** I got the most health.

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** I'll watch last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:08]** Actually, I'm going to see if Chuck can have a sidebar with Bob Guzzle to see if he can arrange a watch so we can all rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:15]** So, like, as you guys are discussing, like, what's going to happen the rest of the night, you're saying that Chalk pulls Bomb Gozzle aside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Yep.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** Hey, we, uh, that battle really took it out of us.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** We really need to rest.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:27]** Is there... Do you have some goblins that you trust to make sure that nothing happens to us while we're sleeping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:31]** Oh, I'll praise Chiyun.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** You are the chosen.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:38]** But I can't say we will watch for you completely.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:45]** We will try, but, like, Rolu, he really shook us.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:55]** So I think the best solution I have is we will put one of ours for one of yours throughout the night.

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:07]** I know there are dangers here, but, like, nothing worse than Tinkerton, which you killed Tinkerton, so, like, I think we could be okay with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Let's do...

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:13]** Since we agree that Rolo's a bit of a horse's a**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** Yeah, f**k that guy.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:16]** Yeah, f**k Rolo from inside the tent.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** That is a real piece of work, we know.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** You just hear it from inside the tent coming out.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** Yeah, Rolo sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** Completely unrelated to this conversation, he's just like, f**k Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** It's his dream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:31]** He's just having like a dream.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** His tail's like swishing around and s**t. Yeah.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:34]** Yeah.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** We'll put one of ours for everybody else.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** That's fair.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** That's fair-a-far, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** That sounds spectacular.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Many thanks.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:47]** Question about your chassis.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** Are you planning to take that with you?

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** You earned it.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** It's yours.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** You're the chosen!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:58]** You take the savage chassis and make for your own.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** You need help?

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Fix?

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** I fix.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** I fix for you.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** I have plenty duct tape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** Warning about Goblin Engine.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** I trust the Goblin with some duct tape for real, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Oh, that got me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Excuse me, that's hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** That is funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:20]** I mean, I would feel great if you were able to fix it.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:23]** I think we're going to rest tonight and then try to get going in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** Can you make a wallet out of your tape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** We have that on our Etsy.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Trash hunter Etsy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:39]** There's going to be, like, new f**k-a-rolu merchandise now on the Etsy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** I want to go to that.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Can we have that?

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:45]** I want to go shop at the junk merchant Etsy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** All right.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** So you guys are setting up camp.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** You're going to take, what, four watches?

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Because there's four of you.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** And for every four of your watches, we're going to match you with a trash hunter or an unbrood.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:04]** I'm meshing you guys together on my fingers.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** See that visual work?

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** Is there anything else you guys want to do before we set into our watches?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** No, let's go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** So who is taking first watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** Treme, I think.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** I'll take the first watch.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** I'm taking seconds.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** Well, I mean, it's not like I, you know, went to combat today.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]** I wouldn't know on full health.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** You're just going to watch all night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** I guess you could if you want to.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** No, I'm not going to.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** I want my spellbook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** Who has darkvision?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:42]** Oh man, I was going to ask that as we went along.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:47]** It is a normal quiet night.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:53]** There's a lot of creaky steel moving in the wind because you're in the middle of a junkyard, technically.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:59]** And occasionally you see a tumbleweed of just like twisted aluminum rolling across the ground.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:04]** And as I said, a random goblin or a keshdi will also stand guard with each of you.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:09]** And sure enough, each of you probably end up chatting with that respective postmate.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:13]** And by postmate, I mean like a watch post, not like the food delivery service.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** That would be nice, but alas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:21]** I really like that new restaurant from Postmates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** The Kaffak one?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Kaffak Bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** Kaffak Bowl?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** No, Kaffak Dog number four.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Don't talk to him.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Don't talk to him.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:37]** I mean, any place that's got more than three, you know it's got to be successful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:41]** So you guys are going to take your rest with one person standing watch.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:46]** In that time, you're probably going to repair your chassis, do whatever you need to do, recover health, whatever.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** But first watch goes to Treme.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:54]** and the goblin, Zagat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:54 - 01:03:00]** Hey, did you make a survey of foreign countries and destinations?

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Like a travel photo of Zagat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:06]** That's the same thing, right?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** I have no idea what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** It's supposed to be an accurate response, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** What is this?

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** What did you say?

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** You're crazy, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** Yeah, I'm pretty crazy, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:24]** So do you have low light or dark vision?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** I have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** You have dark vision.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Let me highlight that.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:28]** Dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:35]** And dark vision means you can see normally within dark light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** Yeah, up to 60 feet.
