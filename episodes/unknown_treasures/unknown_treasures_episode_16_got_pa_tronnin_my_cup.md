**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:07]** Hello, and welcome back to another episode of Unknown Treasures, a part of the Will Save and the Inner Sun Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:10]** You could say it's our extended universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:14]** We're going to extend that universe for you.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:14]** KSMR.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** Is it KSMR time?

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** Ooh, is it KSMR?

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Kevin ASMR, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** Yeah.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** KSMR?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** KSMR.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** Cashmere?

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Cashmere.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** That's all I had planned.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** I don't have anything else planned.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** Sorry.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** I'm really bad at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Delilah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:34]** I know we were all talking about sushi before we got on, and I thought that's where our conversation would go back to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:37]** Oh, we can talk about it if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** What's the connection?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:43]** Just real quick, around the room, what is your favorite roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** Y'all are going to judge the crap out of me.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** Because we just talked about really nice nigiri and sashimi and fancy adult stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Fancy adult stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:14]** There's a roll here called the Green Dragon, and it's basically a California roll, but you sub tempura shrimp for the crab, and they put avocado over the top and drizzle eel sauce on it.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:19]** And that is just, it hits the spot every time I have it.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** That sounds really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:28]** I think mine, Tocoro is the, what we were talking about, Tocoro in South Pasadena is my favorite sushi place in America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** In America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** Well, I mean, like California is probably.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** In the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:39]** California is probably the peak of sushi in America.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Anyways.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, maybe.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:52]** They have a roll called the mountain roll, and I'd have to look up exactly what it is, but it's basically just a pile of spicy tuna on top of a tuna roll.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** And then they use...

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:16]** is it ponzu and uh spicy mayo kind of sprinkled over yeah and it's just like it's just fresh tuna with a little bit of rice and just enough flavor and it's just oh melts melts my mouth it's delicious that's my favorite rolls a mountain roll from takara recommend trying it out that's good

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** Would you say people should fly to South Pasadena?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** How many Michelin stars on Kevin's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Oh, 15 stars.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** It's worth a drive.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** It's definitely worth a drive.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** I don't know if it's worth flying in, but if you're in the region, I'd recommend it.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** If you're in the desert.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Continental United States.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** Yeah, if you're in the deserts of California, go for it.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:46]** If you're in the Pacific time zone, Los Angeles, I guess if you're anywhere in Los Angeles and yes, I think Takara is worth going to.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** I'll try it out.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Done.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:56]** And I think during the week they have, or at least they used to have, um, buy one gear, one beer, get a second beer for a penny.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** So it's classic.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** It's like the typical happy hour.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Classic.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** It's a great place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** So wait, they, they have a good sushi menu and a good happy hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** That's what makes good sushi is the happy hours.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** That's the one-two punch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** That's not quite how it works.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** Good sushi, that's like that kind of sushi.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** That is what brings the door down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** The specialty rolls.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:27]** Anyways, Will, I think it's your turn to tell us what is your absolute favorite sushi roll of all time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** My favorite sushi roll of all time?

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** All time.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** Okay, I'll give you one and a half.

**[00:04:35 - 00:05:02]** i my favorite is the hand rolls at kazanori yeah they're very good which are basically just like toro sashimi on rice wrapped in paper yeah nice and it's done right in front of you at the bar and it's like hand roll only bar it's a hand roll only bar um and they're they're amazing that counts as a roll but if i was gonna go like the specialty roll i like the ones with the was that the half or was that the full

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** That's my favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:04]** That's the half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** It's like, I don't know if it counts as a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Okay.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Yeah.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** The other one is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Is like anything with eel sauce.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** It's good.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** It's good.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Eel sauce is dope.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** It's great.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Yeah.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** We got on this topic because Vinny was like, I will gladly eat my way across the country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Which I am totally with you on that one.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** But what is your favorite sushi roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** Mine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** He just said the green dragon.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** The green dragon.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Oh, green dragon.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Okay.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:41]** So for the listener, we got onto this topic because I'm going out to LA.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:45]** I'm going to the left coast for a couple of days here in a couple of weeks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** The best coast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** And yeah, we'll see.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** I'll let you guys know after I get back.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:55]** And I come from the East Coast, love sushi.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** So like, I love a sushi place.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** no matter where I am.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:06]** And I think we've talked before about how, like, I will try to order sushi when I'm in the Midwest and then realize I'm nowhere near the ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** The sushi pickings here in Maryland are pretty slim.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** There's not, like, a place that I'm like, oh, I love that sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** There's no lobster sushi.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** There's crab.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** There's lots of crab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Blue crab?

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Chesapeake blue crab, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** It's freaking delicious.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** I don't like crab in my sushi unless it's like the fake crab, I guess.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Anyways, that's the whole topic.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** John, what's your favorite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** I'm with Will on the one and a half.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:47]** I literally just had this omakase place, and it was just so good, and it was just like standard sashimi, so just fish on rice, and they usually put the soy sauce or the wasabi

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:51]** like on there for you if it's meant to have that to enhance the flavor.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:55]** And it's usually under the fish on top of the rice, so you bite into it.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:00]** And they'll tell you there, like it doesn't need anything else if you don't want it.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:06]** And I can't remember everything that I had, but I had Toro that was like phenomenal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** But that's on a roll, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** Yeah, but if I had to choose a roll, thank you, Will.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:14]** I'm a scallop guy.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** I really like spicy scallop roll.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** And maybe, yeah, there's some tempura.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** It's like tempura with spicy scallop on top or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Hang on, hang on, hang on.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** You guys on the left coast put scallop in your sushi?

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** I don't, though.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** I don't do scallop.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** This is okay.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Yeah, add that to the list.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** What's your aversion to scallops?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** Whatever sushi place you're at, you'll be like, whatever has scallops in it.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** That's what I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** I love a scallop.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** I like uni.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** Uni's great.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** So I think all of us here have nothing on Kelly.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Yes.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** You're Mr. Worldwide.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Yeah.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Mr. Japan.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** You've lived in Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** I'm just Mr. Japan.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I wish I were worldwide.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** Yeah, not to keep bringing up Japan because it comes up sometimes, but I have to in this case.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:09]** Like, not to flex on everyone, but, like, have some good fucking sushi, all right?

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** Rolls are not a big thing there, generally speaking.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:14]** So, but saba is, like, mackerel.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** That's pretty much, like, my favorite kind of fish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** I was going to say, I had some mackerel, like, crispy mackerel that you dip into, like, a mayonnaise mix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:21]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Yeah.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:27]** Well, besides all of the dipping and crispiness, yeah, like the normal raw sushi mackerel.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** JK, that actually does sound really good.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** Completely raw fish.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Not cooked.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** No, there was also a sushi mackerel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Not microwave.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** There was a fried mackerel chips that was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** I actually would try that.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** I would try that.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** That sounds really good, but just straight up sushi mackerel is good.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:54]** But so when I'm in the States and I'm eating American sushi, I like to go all out with rolls and just do the most American thing ever and get like cream cheese and a bunch of fried shit.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** Yeah, because you might as well just go all the way.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** That's how I feel about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** I can't do cream cheese, so I stay away from most of those rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Yeah, I don't like those rolls.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Savoring cream cheese is gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** Yeah, cream cheese and then in my rice, no.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** But tempura, eel sauce.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** It's like a bagel.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** It's like a bagel.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** Let's not get on that.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** You said salmon locks.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:24]** Dude, I'd love me some bagels and locks, but let's not get into the bagel thing.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** We've already gone down the sushi hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Okay, hang on.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** How far away is bagels and locks from sushi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** We're in Los Angeles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** It's ubiquitous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Everything can be everything here.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** It's a carbohydrate.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** There's people who import water from New York to make their bagels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** Vinny, we will provide you with so much food.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Do not worry.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** I would like to formally request a good ramen place.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I think we can find that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Sujita, where are we going?

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:21]** sujita is probably one of the best ones it's got to be torrents torrents torrents why i don't want to go to torrents torrents really of course torrents that's where it's all at hold on wait a second i think i've been to tatsu but it's not a it's nothing compared to like in the middle of like a grocery store it's true they make that shit in torrents right all right sorry john i don't know i i'm with kelly on this one actually because i do agree


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:26]** The Marukai that's in Culver City or Mar Vista has ramen in the middle of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** That's great.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** What about Dim Sum?

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Oh, Dim Sum has got to be San Gabriel.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** We'll take you to all of these places, Vinny.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** Dude, we only have so much time, you guys.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** You basically have to go on a diet before you come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** That's cool.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** I got two weeks to not eat.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** I fly in Saturday morning.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I fly out Tuesday mid-afternoon.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Somewhere in there.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** We need to document a lot of this.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** Is there like, I've never had hot pot, but I really like it.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** I know a good hot pot place that's really close.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** I've had it from a food truck here.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** No, he hasn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:13]** It was like... We gotta go to like Dato or we gotta go to Parks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** I will bring my camera.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** We will vlog it.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** It'll be a great time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:27]** I had to look it up because I can't... It's been so long since I've been there, but there's a place called Pisces that was down around the corner from where I lived in East LA.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** And they were number two on Yelp one year out of like...

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:55]** all the different like all of yelp they were number two 2020 um and their their ramen he's like he handcrafts his ramen he puts corn with it it's uh it's some of this yeah you think that okay you'd think that just trust okay when we went in he like the owner was like no no just just trust me on this do this this and this this is i've worked so hard on all of this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:21]** oh you're missing out man it's so good i don't like seeing it after there are two schools of thought benny when it comes to ramen there's the classic like daikokuya like torrents probably places like in the supermarket where it's like classic ramen and then there's the ramen like kevin's talking about and i'm talking about with tatsu that's like more modern and they have different flavors and they try out but they still cook their broth for like 24 hours though right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** Well, like here in town, there's a spot where I can go to get like tonkatsu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:32]** There's another spot at the beach where I can get like Cajun ramen that has like andouille and shrimp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** That sounds awesome.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Gumbo flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** That's dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** Before we jump into some important stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:42]** We're going to spend 10 minutes now discussing.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:42]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** I got a little short sushi story.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** One time we pulled into Japan.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** I was on a submarine when I pulled into Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** Navy story too.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** Nonetheless, it was like the day after drinking all night.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** So we're hung over me and one of my friends goes out to like the local town near where we're state like pulled in.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** And, um, all I wanted was a drink.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** So I was like, let's just go to McDonald's and grab like a large soda.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:13]** And we're standing in line at McDonald's on the corner and the doors, I hear the doors slide open and I hear my chief go, uh,

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Decker?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:18]** What the f***?

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** I was like, what?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** And he's like, you're in the middle of Japan.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Go get f***ing sushi.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:28]** And there's a place right around the corner that was the mom and pop sushi place.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** It was phenomenal.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** But I just wanted a soda, but I didn't want to piss off my chief.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** So I was like, yes.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Aye, aye, chief.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Moving.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** Okay.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** I've heard that McDonald's in other countries, though, is different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Oh, totally.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** All American fast food is better everywhere else but America.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** Cool.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** I don't know what it is about what we do, but it's the worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:54]** We export great fast food to the rest of the world.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** We do and they make it way better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** They actually take their food seriously though in most of those countries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** The standards are way higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:08]** When you order something from Fast Food Place in Japan, it looks like it looks on the menu.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Presented to you exactly how it looks on the menu.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I think it's time to move on.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** And I think we should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Let's do it.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Let's do it.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Okay, so let me just run down.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** Last time, you made it past the Kvarkness.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** But without them noticing.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Or not without them noticing.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Wait, what?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Wait, did they notice or not?

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** They didn't.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** They did.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:38]** They also... Did they notice?

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:43]** Last time, you made it past the Kapok Ness, but not without them noticing.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** And each... You each took turns crossing the bridge.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:52]** Torme stepped a little too close to Thaddeus and caused a wall of car seats to topple over.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:58]** Thaddeus' cat-like reflexes kept you both from falling into a river of acid.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:04]** Vario 13 clung to Rolu's side as you guys make it across.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** That's when the K'fax started to swarm the bridge.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** You took a couple of them out, but two more appeared.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:22]** And at an elastic ditch effort, Chak pulled out a breaching charge and handed it to Rolu.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** Amazing.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Who triggered it and then ran for it.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:31]** And you all dove into the sand as the bridge explodes and K'vok's guts go flying everywhere.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Michael Bay would love this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Yep.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** That's my explosion sense.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** All right.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** So you guys are all in the sand.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:52]** As you guys prop yourselves up to stand up, you realize you're in that opening where the dead body was with the android.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:59]** And Termay actually feels his wrist calm kind of vibrate.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** It beeps at you.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:06]** And that's because you did receive a message before, but didn't download all the way.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** This time it did.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** It pings telling you it's complete.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** Uh, it was a message from a radio man named Harden.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:19]** Uh, he tells you that Rolu had 46 contacts, but 40 of them were from the crew of the knaves revenge.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Um,

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:31]** This time, instead of just that message that says that, you also got a folder, which opens up kind of like an Excel sheet.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:38]** There's times, dates, names, IPs, and a file, which is a message for every... They have an internet protocol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** They have an IP address?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Oh, my God.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** I don't know, man.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** I make it up.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** I don't know how this works.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** Yes, they have Internet protocol numbers and whatever.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** So anyways, there's a message.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Each line has a message.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** There's hundreds of these messages.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:04]** Majority of them, though, are from two people, a Shira Dawnbreaker and someone named Frango Voss.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:12]** But in the message and with this file, there's also a separate file attached.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** Yeah, didn't he say, like, there's an interesting one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** He said this one is the most suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** What do you do?

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** I'm going to keep it close to my chest for now.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:29]** And as we're walking away, I think I might just, like,

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** you know, collect myself, so to speak.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** You know, dust off my robes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** How is everyone feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yeah, I just need a second.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** In ship shape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** Vary, are you okay?

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:53]** That was quite an ending to that moment, but you made it across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** I am fine, thank you.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** I don't know what I would have done without you.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** You would have survived.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** As you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Stuck inside of a semi-truck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:12]** How do we get back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** I think we should take the western route.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** We already have to go through two more layers of Calfox.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Let's cut one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Let's cut that in half.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Agreed.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:30]** Because below us, there's that tightly wound canyon where there were Calfox last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Yeah.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Screw that.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** I could probably do a 10-minute rest.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** I don't know.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** I don't need to, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** And burn a resolve?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Oh, I guess not.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Never mind.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I don't have any resolve to burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Oh, man, you're out of resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** I'm out of... I have zero resolve.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** No.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Don't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** Yeah, don't say that in front of Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Kev's eyes literally just lit up.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** He scares me, man.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** You thought Rick19 was a murder bot.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Kev is a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Kev is just by himself.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** It was Kevin all along.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Kevin!

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:06]** Kevin was Rick 19.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Have you ever seen Kevin and Rick 19 in the same room?

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** That's right.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** So, Tomei, are you going to pull off from the crowd?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** Yeah, as they're walking.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** I assume as they're walking off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:26]** Okay, so which way are you guys going?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** West.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** We're going to head west.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** West.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Towards the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:34]** This is where it was like a three-way intersection.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:41]** You came up and around from the southeast side, and there actually weren't any K'Vox in that area.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** There were, I thought.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** Okay.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** It's all rubber.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** We thought there was going to be a tire dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** I thought you meant the other side.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Okay.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** There was actually no... There were no K'Vox anywhere.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** There was no boss.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Either side.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Yeah.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** And there was no boss that you found until this time.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Vary, stay close.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:02]** We need to get you back so we can... Yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** I'm also in control of Vary, which... Yeah, anyways.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Bye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Vary sticks close to Rolu.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:20]** So Rolu, Chuck, and Vary are coming around that curve up to the northwest and around the bend where you see the tire mountain that partially toppled over.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** What are you doing, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:29]** Well, Thaddeus knows he is going to give Tremé an opportunity to report because Thaddeus, he did mention that he was going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:34]** You catch Tremé kind of dangling back and you're like... I feel like you have to roll a check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I don't know.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Here's the thing.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** He requested that you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** So he's going to give you an opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** But I have an opportunity to like, I might not, you know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Yeah, you can do whatever you want to do.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** But Thaddeus just kind of looks at you over his shoulder.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** Like he's waiting for you.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Give me a moment.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Okay.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Thaddeus just kind of leans against the wall.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** I'll check.

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** I'll check now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** He's checking.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** So you push the play button.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** What is he pushing the play button on?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** The message.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** The message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Do I have like earbuds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** Wait, so there's like a separate folder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** There was a file attached that had a recorded conversation, I suppose, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:27]** So there's basically an Excel sheet of all these messages, right?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:33]** There's hundreds of messages, but there's one separate one that's not in that folder that was attached separately.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:39]** that basically Radio Men Harden said, this is a suspicious message.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** I think you should listen to this one.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** This one caught my ear.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** And so he pushes play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:50]** ROLU, Captain Hears has collected your shirts.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:54]** Three of the star maps were disposed of.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:58]** The rest are in... Ah, damn it, computer!

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** Rewind five seconds, overwrite.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Okay.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:07]** ROLU, your contact has collected your shirts.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** Three of the star maps could not be found.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** The rest have been procured.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:16]** Your contact will pass them along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Wow.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** That is kind of suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Yeah, that's very suspicious.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** What are you going to do with that?

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** What do you think to me?

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** And this was to what ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:34]** The Dave's Revenge is the name of the ship that Rolu came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** It was here's his ship that he kept.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Yeah, I was going to say, give me a culture check.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** If you scored high enough, you would know this was here's his ship.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** Does a 25 get me in?

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Definitely.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** So you just know.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:54]** It's very apparent that this ship belonged to a pretty famous free captain by the name of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:04]** So I'm going to tell Weps, I'll be like, yes, it seems though our friend Rolu may have some allegiances outside of our crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Have a look.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** Thaddeus walks over and listens to the message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** He just grabs his wrist and pushes the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:22]** He's so like unwound because he senses that something's wrong with Rulu that he just grabs it almost super forcefully.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Let me listen.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Let me listen.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:27]** He listens and he thinks to himself.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I knew it.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** I can swear that Rulu is a traitor.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** He thinks to himself.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** And I have to prove it.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** And he sees all these other messages in there.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** And he says to T'may, Well done, T'may.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Later on, I'd like to review the rest of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Yes, we can go over them together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** So may I keep this between you and me only?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Yes, of course.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:05]** Although, fair warning, if I receive communique from the captain, I won't hesitate to bring it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:10]** The captain doesn't know what's going on, but of course to me.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** If it comes to that.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** If it comes to that.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** I think the captain and I will see eye to eye.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Thank you.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** I prefer it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:28]** And I'll just silently, you know, I'll be dusting off my robes since I took a dirt splash after that explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Hey, are you all following?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** We need to keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** On our way.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Of course, Rolo.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:39]** You guys gather back up as a group as you come back around to where those tires were.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** And actually...

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:49]** This is when Chuck realizes that his comms device didn't send his messages earlier.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:55]** And so he looks down at it and scrolls through and goes, oh, that one didn't send.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** And he pushes the resend button.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:04]** Do you want to tell everybody what your messages are or do you want to just leave it at that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Yeah.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:13]** So he sent, um, a couple of messages to the captain trying to, trying to keep cap informed of what's going on.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:21]** Uh, the first was, um, I guess shortly before we went across the bridge, I guess shortly after we went across the bridges, that's when we lost bars.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Uh, this is,

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** We get our way through the car yards.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** We fought multiple K'faks and something is up between Thaddeus and Tremaden.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Tensions seem high.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** And the other, he typed out as we were coming back across the bridge.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** He says, we found the android we were looking for in the car yards.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** We were looking for something to revolutionize faster than light travel.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** There's got to be more to come on that.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** We also got swarmed by some K'foks by a rickety bridge.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** Turns out that breaching charge, it did come in handy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** Nice.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** Cool.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** So you guys are – go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Sorry.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:20]** I just want to say I like Chuck in his message voice, and I like – it's like each of your internal voices, especially in Thaddeus' is so like, you're a traitor.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** It's so angry, and then immediately you're like, thank you to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:48]** you know it's like totally different it was just and then the way that thaddeus thinks and he said i don't know it's great it's cool it's cool thanks man i like your dawnbreaker voice a lot especially given the inspiration that she comes from that character you did fantastic on that oh thanks on that inspiration thanks yeah it was great it was a great reference i don't know the reference are we supposed to know that reference


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:52]** Find out next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:59]** The reference that I was like, I used, if you've ever seen Treasure Planet, that Disney animated movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** I was just thinking about watching this.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** I've never seen it, and I was trying to find where I can watch it.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** I think it's on Disney+.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** Captain Amelia from that.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Captain Amelia is the inspiration for sure, Don Brady.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Check it out.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Great.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Super great.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Really cool.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Will do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** Your contact.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** It's just... Your contact.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** So, it's... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Nicely done.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** Great voice acting from Captain Amelia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Anyway.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Kevin.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** All right.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:30]** So, you guys are all in a group now, and you're standing near this mountain of tires.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Let's see it.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** You guys...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:42]** Oh, no, I was just saying, because it's you, I was just going to be like, we're as far away as possible from them as we go through this game.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Yeah, we slide past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** We're like hugging the wall.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Why don't you give me a perception check?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** Can I ask you for a time check?

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** What time is it right now in this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** In game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:04]** the equivalent of like 435 in the middle of summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** So it's like cooling down a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:11]** Do we still have our get them bonus for perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Look alive?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Look alive.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Sorry.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** 17.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** I got a 20.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** 15.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Dirty 20.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** It makes sense for Shaq to be so perspective.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Yeah.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** He's perceiving all kinds of little things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** So you look over at this tower of tires.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** You see rubber piled on top of rubber.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:40]** And you see more tires on top of those tires.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** That's it.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** Cool.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** That's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** I'm happy with that result.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:59]** I think Rolu notes some shading of the tires that he's like, I'm going to replicate this.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Is that a good year?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Are you going to use tire paintings now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:07]** Yeah.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** He pauses, pulls out a pedestal.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** It's a move action for you to do that.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Happy little tires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** This will look great on my Instagram.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** And Jermaine takes a photo.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:21]** Jermaine takes a photo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Chuck, get in front of it.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** Take a photo.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Vahri, are you staying with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Vahri, sorry.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** I was going to just link Vahri to you so I didn't have to worry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** You did, but it's weird.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** You did, but you didn't.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Vahri just completely covered Rolio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Thank you for reminding me.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** So yes, Vahri is staying very close to Rolio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Okay.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Stay alert.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:47]** We're coming up on the area where we had to fight those Cap Hacks last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** Kev, can you unlink me from Vari?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** Because it is very... I've already unlinked you.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** I don't know...

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** You're not linked on mine.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** When I move, she moves.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** When I move, she moves.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Just like that.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Oh, I see.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Is it?

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Okay.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** No.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yeah.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Wrong one.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Did that work?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Wow.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:12]** I'm sad that it didn't work because I was hoping that every time you moved, it would just follow, but I realize it makes it complicated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** We're getting close to where the K'vuk's were, Thaddeus.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** Shaq, can you take a look real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** From a distance, do you see anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:27]** Shaq draws his hunting rifle and then... Fires it.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:32]** Alerts all the gift box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** I see you, Jack.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:46]** Okay, so actually what happens is you guys come around that bend and you make it back to the, basically the other side of this wall, there are two different three-way junctions.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** So you're back at that junction.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:58]** that first junction you came out of that you can either go left or right and one's tires and one was that part that looped around.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:07]** And I actually have it blocked off here from you guys, so bear with me for a second as I clear the path for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** I'm playing with dynamic light.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** I'm sure we're going to have to fight some thugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** I just had to fill it with monsters.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** I don't know if that revealed it.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** There's just a... No, I don't see anything.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Oh, there.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Okay, I got it.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** I got to grab this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:23]** You have to make a bunch of conversation checks, performance checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** Yeah, let me just... So you guys see the black still, right?

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Yep.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** All right, then I'm going to reveal these things here.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** You guys still don't see anything, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Nope.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Adios goes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Get ready for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** You did your...

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Oh, naturally.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Freaking naturally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:49]** Are you joking?

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** So listeners have no idea what's going on.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** I was just messing around with dynamic lighting.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** I had it all shaded off for them.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** They couldn't see.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** Go ahead and stay exactly where you are on the map.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** As you guys roamed around this corner, Chuck kind of ran ahead.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** Chuck turns to Webster and says, Noka Fox.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:17]** What you do see is the two familiar-looking true warrior Yusokis.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** There's one other true warrior.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:23]** It's a Hilki, but he's strong.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** He's big.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** He's got large muscles and a bandana.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** He looks like a pirate.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** He's a desert pirate.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** He's actually called a tough warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** And in the middle of all of them is a woman.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** She is a Hilki, but she's very pale.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** She has bleach white hair.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:49]** And I'm going to actually show you what she looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Oh, man.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Tez Tronin.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** She looks like a female Sephiroth, basically.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Yeah, she does.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** We wouldn't know her name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** You would actually presume her name.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** Does she introduce herself?

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** I believe Riddle did tell you that.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Okay.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** After one of your fights.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** She was the one in the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Got it.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** So she's a higher up.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** We recall that.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** She's a higher up with the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** She is the truest warrior.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** True.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** So she actually looks pretty cool.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** She has, like, a uniform that's reminiscent of, like... She looks cool.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** I don't know, like, European...

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** She looks like a motorcycle.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Yeah.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:32]** And then she has, like, basically a lightsaber, but it's, like, in the shape of, like, a loosely put together broadsword or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:36]** It looks like a beam of light that she has shaped into a broadsword.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** All right, yeah, ignore that part.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** That's fine.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** So, metagame, you know she's a Solarian.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Yeah.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Man, spoilers everywhere.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Gosh.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Great.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Great.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** Anyways, she actually looks at you and is like, oh, welcome.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** So, you are the ones.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:03]** You've taken out some of my men, and you're clearly protecting something very valuable.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Get it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Very valuable.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Very valuable.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** That was good.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** Before this gets ugly, I'll give you one last chance.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** You can hand over that android and get off planet.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** The true warriors will forget who you are.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Or your other option is death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:28]** Conversely, if we kill you, you will forget who we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Yes, you won't be able to remember us then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:35]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** That was check.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** That was not mini.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** That was check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Wow, they're not screwing around.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** 22.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** I rolled horribly.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Wait, do we have a plus two to initiative?

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Is that what it is with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** You do have a plus two to initiative.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** 24, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** 24 for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:55]** 21 for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** 21 for Chuck.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Oh, no way.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** I made a mistake.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** It's 22 because it's already applied.

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** I rolled a 23.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** I got a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** 23.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Okay.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** That's red for some reason on this Excel sheet.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Rolhu, what did you get?

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** 10.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** 10.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** You all scored high except for Rolhu who made the threat.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** I know.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** Sorry, and I do have to roll for Vahri.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** Rolhu was too busy congratulating himself for the sick burn.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:33]** I almost didn't have Rulu say it, but I think now with Vahri surviving all this through us, he just feels protective of them.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Classic Rulu.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Classic Rulu.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:41]** So let me just do this real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** Do I get any spell slots after leveling up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I know.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** I was thinking the same thing.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** I'm like, I've gotten some first level spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:56]** If you gained a new level spell, like if you got a level one spell, you would have gotten at least one spell slot with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Okay, so I gained cantrips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:06]** I think, Will, you and I similarly, we have learned a new spell.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** But did we get another spell use?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Because I don't know that we did.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** So spells, no.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Whatever.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** It's fine.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** I think we have to rest for that, unfortunately.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, it sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Great.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** Also, why do we have to pick a fight?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** We could have just given... No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** I mean, it's not really part of our plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** We could kill you, but...

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:39]** Get the hell over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:47]** You guys all rolled really high, but one of them rolled higher than you.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** That is actually the Yusoki.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Yusuke warrior number one.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** They have a very high initiative bonus.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** This Yusuke is going to take a pop shot at you.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** It's going to shoot at Thaddeus.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** He remembers how easy they were to go down.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:08]** Actually, no, you guys killed all those Yusukes, right?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:13]** I remember how easy you were to go down.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** Let me see.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** That's a plus four to hit.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** That is...

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** A 22.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Does a 22 hit, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:25]** Actually, okay, so this is probably an error maybe in roll 20.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:32]** I don't know, but that squad Aegis series armor that you gave me gives me a hell of a lot of bonus to EAC and KAC.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** So it wouldn't in that case, but I don't know.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** It shouldn't give you any bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** I think it just, if you get hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** That's not what it says.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Squad Aegis.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Oh, yeah, you're right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:41 - 00:38:03]** yeah if you get hit it takes five points of damage right so it is so yeah well it doesn't say that but i but i i believe that um okay cool so um and you take five points of damage what's your eac so if you had your your aegis on without it let me take it because it it modifies my eac enormously so i'm gonna take it off and um

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** If it... I'm sorry, what was it to hit again?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** 22, you said?

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Or 20?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** 22, yeah.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Yeah, it hits then if I take this off.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** A breakaway Aegis is what you have, right?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** A breakaway Aegis, yeah.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Let's just say it's that instead of squad Aegis like I have equipped.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Let's just say a breakaway Aegis.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** It fits on the wearer's arm.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** It's interlocking metals.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** I think it wasn't in roll 20.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** That's why I put that there.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** It negates five damage but causes the Aegis to crumble.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** So that was five hit to hit.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** If it would have been six, you would have taken only one point damage.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:41]** But basically it shoots and the Aegis kind of like –

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** blocks the bullet and shatters and crumbles to the ground.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Nice.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** You can scoop it all up.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Sad.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** And re-engineer it into armor again.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** But for now, it's crumbled.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** But you take no damage, which is nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** So the true warrior is going to do that.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** And then these Yusoki's like to take cover.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:05]** So the Yusoki's going to run back behind this pile here.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** And as it does... Every time...

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** What?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** A Kefauk attacks it?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Yes!

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Amazing.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** There's a Kefauk hidden among that junk there.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Let me reveal it.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** And it gets an attack of opportunity as the Soki passes.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Yes.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** So let me layer token.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** There we go.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Let me look at the Kefauks.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** Kefauks get...

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** Plus four to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Nice.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:42]** I really want Chak to, like, take out, you know, like, some little reed and make a call, and it's like a K'fok call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** And they all, like, come running, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:50]** So the Soki actually, the K'fok misses.

**[00:39:50 - 00:40:03]** and just swings at it but the Yosuke kind of stops and he's like what the they were not expecting this they must not have passed him on the way in it is now Treme's turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:08]** Can I quickly roll a perception check?

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:12]** I want to see which of them are equipped with ranged weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** You don't need to roll for that.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** You know the Yosokis have pistols out.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:22]** You can see that Tez also has a weapon, a gun, in their hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** Our main character here?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Yeah, Tez is the unique.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** The brutish-looking dude with the chin curtain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:39]** He's been crunching his knuckles at you for this entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Crunch, crunch, crunch.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:48]** So I am going to cast Misfire.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** On?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** On Tez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Okay.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** How does that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** DC, uh, 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** I want it.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** Just roll.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Terrible roll.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** So it didn't even matter.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** So what does that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:22]** So misfire, uh, makes it so that the next time that you try to use that weapon, it fails.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:46]** automatically fails automatically fails because i failed fire or operate this spell ends once it prevents the targeted object so it only works one round and it can't be cast multiple rounds on the same object so that's awesome so if you try if you're within this round if you try to shoot at us it's just gonna miss which yeah nice or misfire it won't fire got it got it got it

**[00:41:46 - 00:42:11]** cool uh that's awesome are you gonna move or you stay in your place um yeah i'm gonna try and move i'm just gonna spread out just in case like one of them has a grenade yeah um just you know some practical some practical tactics for y'all uh you don't want to clump up uh in combat just in in in real life or in game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Oh, look at that.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Tremei giving out the knowledge.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Just kidding.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Will's spreading it.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Sorry, what?

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** Because Thaddeus is always the one to be like, make sure you reload.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** I'm going to reload.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** That was well done, Tremei.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** Exactly what I would have done and what I told you to do before.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** That other time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Which is appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Because it's now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** All right.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** Well, Thaddeus, like, there are people that are close enough to him.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** So there's Rolu and the android.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:44]** And he says to the android, he's like, I hope you can help, Thaddeus.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:49]** And then he says, low enough for the surrounding people to hear, but not enough for these enemies to hear.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** Like, we should push them into the rubble with a fox so they can get attacked.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** And then he's going to take out his gun.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** He's going to shoot Sephiroth, female Sephiroth.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** What's her name again?

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Her name is Tez.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Tez.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** You can take a full action to do that twice.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Wait, did you have your weapon out?

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** That is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** Yes, and plus I'm a soldier, so it matters not that much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** Well, for a full action, it would matter because you don't get a movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** So it was out, bro.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** Okay, I don't think any of them hit.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** So they don't hit.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Let's just simplify.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** What did you roll?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Tell us.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Well, I mean, like, it's a minus four to hit, right?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** So then, like, each of those is, like, an eight and a nine.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** So it's basically, like, a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Yeah, those did not hit.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** No.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Okay.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** That's fair.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Good try, Catboy.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** It is now Chuck's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Chuck lets out a snicker.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** That is his failure.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** And...

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:53]** I'm going to look around at all of my colleagues to see if any of them don't have their weapons drawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Colleagues, are any of your weapons not drawn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** I've got my azimuth still out from when we took out those K'faks.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** I never put my weapon away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Cool.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:19]** Then I'm going to use my not-in-the-face ability to... I'm going to use my not-in-the-face ability on the Hilki meat dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** All right, and what does Not in the Face do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** Not in the Face, make a DC 14 will save.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** If you fail... Will save!

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Will save!

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** You take a minus four to any attacks against me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Say that again?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** Takes a minus four to any attacks against me.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** If he fails the will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:43]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** It's pretty cool, Shaq.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** I got a 12.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** 12 fails.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Cool.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:58]** In that case, Shaq is going to walk right up to him and say, You wouldn't hit a plant, would you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:04]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Is that your whole turn?

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** That's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Okay.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Interesting.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Yes, Shaq confused them.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** It is now the other Yosuke's turn.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** And let me just do a quick perception check.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Yeah, all right.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** That makes sense.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** He is focused on you guys.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:34]** He doesn't notice Chak, and he takes a shot at Thaddeus, who's kind of the front leader right now.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** But there's a minus two for soft cover.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Am I correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Because Tez is between them.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** You're the GM.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** You're always correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:54]** So it's a 14.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Is a 14 KAC hit?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Yes.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** All right.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** This is tough.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** That's four points of damage.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:12]** And then that Yosuke doesn't really realize what's happening to the other one.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Am I on the right selection?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:22]** It is going to move down back around this corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Nice.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Okay.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** That's a good place to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Yeah.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Okay.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** It is now Tez Tronin's turn.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** Let me just do a little perception check.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** What are you going to do, Tez?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:42]** I'm going to say that she does notice Choc, and she has her pistol out.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:49]** She just raises her arm, brings it down, and points her gun straight at Choc's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** And pulls the trigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** But it misfires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** That was clutch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** I love that.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:15]** I'm going to say that's her whole turn because I think she would spend the rest of that round unjamming her gun, not realizing it's a problem.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Incredible.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** That is the end of Tez's turn.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** It is Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Really?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Okay.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:38]** I think Rulu, seeing Thaddeus get shot at a couple times, is going to say, Thaddeus, we need to spread out, but I'm going to try and take some cover for you.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:47]** And Rulu's going to step forward, staying essentially in front of the line of sight, Tavari, going to take a...

**[00:47:49 - 00:48:04]** Actually, he's not gonna move he's gonna stay right where he is because he wants to stay in front of Ari and he's going to To a full action shot on Tess Rolling twice

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Just like nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Yeah.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Yes.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Wow.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Will, thank you for this dice that you got for my birthday.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** The one that looked like dragon dice.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Yeah, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:23]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** Kev, can I do the card?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Is that cool?

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Yes.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** Sweet.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Not the critical fumble deck.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** That's for chumps.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** I go with the critical...

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:59]** uh okay for everybody at home i am just gonna do a quick shoeful and then just gonna cut the deck grab the card on top i'm firing a an energy weapon ranged weapon um

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:28]** oh what is oh man what are the the one bad thing about these cards is that I can't ever remember what the different types are isn't this ranged it's ranged but the thing is is that like it gives you like all these little symbols right oh okay yeah so one is I think kinetic one is magical and one is like a weapon I think

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:59]** let's just go with the kinetic one if that makes sense oh it's energy kinetic or spell oh and there's definitely yeah it's energy so uh it would be because you're using your laser gun thing yeah using the azimuth laser serpentine yes uh oh it says so there too okay energy it is muscle damage the target moves one step down the dexterity poison track what until healed all right that's awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Yeah.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** So what is the first?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** I think I have that written down somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** It's core rule book page 415.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:12]** And then I would... So that goes to Sluggish?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I guess so.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** Yeah, the Dex Poison track.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** All right.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:21]** And then would it be regular double damage like it normally is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** Yeah.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** You roll twice and add bonuses.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:27]** So I think the Dex Poison track makes you sluggish.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** That's going to be a minus two to KAC and EAC.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Yeah.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Muscle damage.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** And then that's 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:37 - 00:51:02]** to test yeah okay um dang quick quick correction kev i don't think that that sluggish takes away anything it's not sluggish ac no that's stiffened um so sluggish you take minus two to reflex and decks ability checks attack rolls skill checks dcs of spells and you become flat footed flat footage does take down oh yeah you're right got it yes yahtzee


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Yahtzee.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:04]** Wow.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:09]** Also, penalty to reflex saving dexterity-based checks attack rolls.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** So I get a minus two to my attack rolls, too?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Yep.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Sweet.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** Try to help me remember that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Oh, we will.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** What is that?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Oh, yeah, we definitely will.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** What does that look like, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** What does what look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** The shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** Um, well, shocking to believe it.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** Your laser, like you just hit just right and you trigger shoot it, right?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** And it blows bigger than you expect.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** And it, she can kind of just brush it off.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** She, she takes the hit.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** She stumbles a little bit backwards.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:47]** And then she just looks at you dead-eyed.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Like, you don't even notice the effects.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** I'm putting all the effects in, but, like, she's not letting you see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Oh, man.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:02]** Can we, like... Does she have any, like, augmentation or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** She could be a projection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:10]** Yeah, could we do, like... Could we do, like, some sort of investigation, perception, life science, anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** That's a good idea.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** I will let you...

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Do that on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Okay.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** I don't think Roloo would notice that quite yet.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Unless you say so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** Well, I'm like looking intently at the fight from my covered position.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** I think Roloo just pissed.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** All right.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** That's Roloo's turn.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** And he's going to say, yeah.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** Oh, that was the first roll on the full attack action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:39]** Oh, and it's a crit, so you'd have to take minus two or minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Well, I already took a minus four, but I rolled out 20.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:45]** And then this was just a nine flat against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Okay.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** So you do that first shot.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** The second shot just completely misses.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Vari, stay behind me if you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:58]** Vari is behind you, but they actually pull out a gun.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** They have a semi-automatic pistol.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Nice.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** And they are going to roll the hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Heck yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Tez Tronin.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** They completely miss.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:17]** In fact, they get a little close because they are standing behind the two of you and they pull that trigger.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:24]** Yeah, you hear it kind of whip between the two of you and it goes off and ricochets off the wall and doesn't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:29]** Thaddeus, can you and I like side-eye like, what the hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** It's like the hairs are like singed by Thaddeus' ears a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** He just like smells a little bit sniffing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:49]** So now, the way the board is set up, you guys are starting to spread out in that three-way intersection, except Choc is right in the middle of it.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:52]** He walked right up to the Choc, True Warrior.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** So there's Tez Ronan and the True Warrior standing right next to Choc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Let me at him!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:04]** The two Yusokis had moved back and the K'fok took one swing at the Yusoki.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** It's going to take, it's actually going to do a full round to hit.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** It took two swings this time.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** That's a 14.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** That, let me just check my numbers.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** That does hit.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Okay.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** And then I'm going to roll again.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:30]** So it hits once, and that's going to be a D6 of damage towards the Yosuke.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** It's three points of damage on the Yosuke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Nice.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Sweet.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** That is exactly what I want to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** Kefauk's coming to our side.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** So that's one Kefauk.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:50]** And then out of the pile near the other Yosuke comes a second Kefauk.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** You guys can see it now.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:55]** It kind of just comes out the top of the pile, and it's going to do the same thing.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** It's going to do two attacks.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** That one hits.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Ace.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** That one does not.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** It's only one point of damage, though.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Just disappointing.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** I'm rooting for you guys on this one.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** So that one.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** All right.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:19]** So each K'fok attacked their respective Yusokis.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:26]** And now it is the tough warrior's turn.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** He actually does not notice Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** He's crunching his knuckles and staring at this group.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:39]** And this tiny plant thing kind of like waddles over to him.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** He's like, hey, tough guy.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** And he actually is going to run right past you.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:48]** He kind of steps over you.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Maybe he steps on your leaves as he goes.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** And he's going to get right here.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** And hold on.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Let me.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** I have to scroll back down in my notes.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** I have this all prepped.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** And then you guys asked a question like, oh, what about Dex poisons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** I think you might have moved him one square too far.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** He's on top of Roller right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** No, he looks fine.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** He looks fine on my map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** All right, let me refresh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** He's actually going to do a bull rush.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Actually, yeah, you're right.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** He's going to go just towards Thaddeus.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Oh, God.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:31]** He's going to do a bull rush, which he can knock the target back five feet plus an additional five feet for every five, which I roll over the results of a KAC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** What's your KAC plus eight, Kelly?

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** I'll wait until Kevin's done with his roll on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** Uh-huh.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Uh-huh.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** I hope I get a natural 20 on this.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Nat 20.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** What are you adding?

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:44]** One.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Give me a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** The one would be good, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** Does a 15 plus 8 hit?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** 15 plus 8?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Wait a second.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** That's not how it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** What?

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** What are you talking about?

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** That's not how it works.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** I don't want to do the math.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** It's a 23.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Does a 23 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** Wait, why are you adding?

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Why do you get a plus eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:09]** I thought you have to beat his KC plus eight to do a bull rush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** That's how it works.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** What is up with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:15]** Unless you're saying you have a plus eight bonus to do a bull rush, which is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** I'm telling you, I rolled 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:46]** to do okay what so what is your kac plus eight it's 20 so you rolled a 23 so ty goes to the to the player bull rush does not take any damage right from my understanding or else you knock tarbot back five feet plus an additional five feet for every five so i did not pass any five additional okay i don't think you knock him down either though knocks him back i don't think five feet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** I beat his KAC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** Yeah.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** 23, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Oh, it was 20.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Yeah.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Kelly's is 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** So, uh, your KC is 12.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** Kelly doesn't sound right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Yeah.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** It's really with armor.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** That doesn't sound right.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Well, I only have the breakaway armor.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:11]** Oh, I guess you were wearing that, and then you weren't wearing anything else.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** Maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** I don't know.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Someone else ought to tell me what their armor is.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** I mean, my freebooter armor is like...

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:22]** Well, I probably screwed up doing some stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** We can look at it after the fact.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:31]** So the true warrior steps over Chak and just comes charging at Thaddeus and he pushes him.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Knocks him back five feet.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:37]** And that's the end of our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** What?

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:44]** I want to kick their ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** We'll do it, Hulu.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** We'll get them yet.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:01]** Until next week, drift beguines and distant stars.
