**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Kelly, you're right behind me, too.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** Dude, I'm right across from Kevin, and it's kind of weird.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I haven't seen Kevin in forever.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Now I'm, like, staring into his soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** I should hide your face on Skype because I have you up on Skype, but I also have you, like, right here next to the computer.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** That's cool.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I love being back.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Apart of that, I was visiting some friends.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:48]** You have friends?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Yes, I have other friends.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Here's a fun story for you.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** So you came to see other friends?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** I came to see everybody I ever knew.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** How dare you?

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:00]** That's a lot of people, dude.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:07]** Anyway, so we were visiting some friends today and all the kids are growing up and one of their friends' kids is five years old.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Six now, sorry, six.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** And here's the story.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** The six-year-old walks up to me and says, hey, where's your dog?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:24]** And just so if anybody's not aware, I lost my dog and one of my best friends about six months ago.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:30]** And so I informed this six-year-old that I lost my dog and that he passed away.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** And the six-year-old then looked at me and goes, what?

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:34]** I didn't.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** Oh, and I see the father in the background.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** His eyes get big.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** And I'm like, oh, you just committed a faux pas.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Oh, yeah, then it gets worse.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:46]** And then you started talking about the Easter Bunny?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Like, what?

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Santa.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:54]** I'm not even sure how the conversation got there, but at some point he was like, well, where is he now?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** I was like, well, he passed away, so we cremated him.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** And he's like, what's cremation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** And I was like, oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** How old is this kid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Six.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** It's not your responsibility, Kevin, to mind that.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** His dad should have told him by now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** This kid is like... I'm so glad we're recording this.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:20]** Kelly, when you have a kid, we're going to play this back for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:26]** I'm going to teach your children all the terrible things in the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:30]** Every week, it's a new word regarding death.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:34]** Is it that hard to like... Okay, so you were going to finish your story, Kevin.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** I interrupted your story.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** No, no, that's fair.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** This kid, he's... I'm going to say different.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Micah Gamble, your son is wonderful.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** But he...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** He's different in the fact that he's a six-year-old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:56]** He's a six-year-old that watches ancient civilization shows on the History Channel.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Oh, so it's me.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** You should know about death all the time.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** He's me when I was that age.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:06]** So the problem is that he's also very emotional and so he takes it to heart whenever something passes away.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:11]** So now it's like, oh, he's going to be harping on Boney's loss for the next six months.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** And I just explained to him what cremation is and how we take...

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** The ones that passed away and burned them.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** He looked me in the eye and said, what about the bones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:26]** And I was like, those get burned too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** You can burn anything if it's hot enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Yeah, I guess I finally did.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:36]** I patched up a little bit by explaining that by burning the body, you're releasing the soul back to...

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** And that was enough for the mom to be like, okay, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** We'll stop you right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:49]** Thank you for... You should have just said, like, and when it dies, that's it, man.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** His eyes went blank.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** You're never going to see my dog again.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** No, I love my dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:59]** My wife swears that she hears him shake and huff every once in a while.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** And I'm jealous because I don't hear that.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** Yeah.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** I know I love that dog way more than she does.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Do you have dreams with Bodhi?

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** I miss my dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Have you dreamt about him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** No, I don't think I've had any dreams with Bodhi directly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** I've dreamt about Terrence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** Yeah, I dream about my dog sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** I dream about Ninja.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I dream about other people's dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Have you never had a dog, Vinny?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** Never had a dog.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** Have you ever had a lizard or something?

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Like a cat?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** Nope.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Any pets?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** Never had a pet.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Are you ever going to have a dog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** That is currently in negotiations.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** I would love to have a dog.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:42]** But my wife, and rightfully so, is convinced that I will take care of it for like three months and then it will be entirely on her.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** Which is fair because that's probably what would happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Is that what happens with your kids?

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** Like they hit three months old and you're hands off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Finny, it's fine.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** You build all the stuff.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** You just tell her, I build the things.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** You take care of the living things.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** I get the non-organic stuff.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** You get the organic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** If it's carbon-based, it's all you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:14]** I have a question for you guys related to Kevin's story.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** When would you tell your kids that death is a thing?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** What age?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** I had to experience that at one years old for Grayson.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** One and a half.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** He was one and a half when Bodhi passed away.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** It was tricky, but he got it.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** I told Grayson that Bodhi is gone.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** And he knows that.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]** And it's sad because like now we have Bodie on our calendar.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:42]** You know, my wife makes a calendar for the full year and Bodie's in all the pictures all the way until December.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:49]** And then we also have like his footprint or his paw print on the table or on the table, the like shelf.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** And Grayson points at Bodie all the time and says, Bobo, Bobo.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** And so he recognizes that that's our dog.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** And he knows that the dog is no longer here.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:04]** So I don't know when I'm going to have to explain cremation to him.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Yeah.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** That's another topic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** I think context and, and like everyone's different, right?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Just comes up.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** You have to eventually.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Right.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** Well, and that's you all, we all learn things at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Well,

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:26]** And for the approach that Jen and I have tried to take is to always tell our kids the truth, just in age-appropriate terms.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** Like, hey, we had a bit of a medical scare.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:35]** My wife is fine now, but we were not sure if she was for a good week or two.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** And like, my daughter was there.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** I was holding her while they took my wife away in an ambulance.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** And like, she was not in a great place.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** And like, where's mommy?

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Where's she going?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** What are they doing?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** What's wrong with her?

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Is she going to be better?

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** And like, I don't know, kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:07]** I mean, this is going to turn into like a therapy session, but I, my first experience with my, my, my very first experience with death, I think I was like three or four years old and it was, my grandfather was in the hospital bed in the living room at my grandparents' house.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** And I remember pretty much the entire family, 60, 70 people at the house.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** And, um, I think I, I remember watching him pass away.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** Like I was near him when he stopped breathing and,

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** But I was too young to understand that.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:28]** And I just remember watching the people's faces around me change and shift and everybody's focus turn towards him.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:33]** Because everybody's there visiting and celebrating his life.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:38]** And then he actually passed and the whole room just went quiet and the stairs changed.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:42]** And I was there looking up at all these people from their ankles.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** I'm like, man.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Anyways.

**[00:09:44 - 00:10:10]** is this a weird segue into killing our characters nearly yeah i was gonna say nobody's died on the show yet yeah speaking of death wow yeah that's a hard one i came close yeah thaddeus thaddeus was there twice um and then termay got there wait wait twice oh yeah maybe twice in the same fight everyone's been down more or less at this point except shack did rolo go down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** He did, yeah.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** That's right.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** He's been on death's doors.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Yeah.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Chalk's just giggling away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** He is.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** He's a bit of an opportunist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Plot twist.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Chalk is death.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** He is.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** We find it out at the very end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** He is the god.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** When you die, some vines just come out of the darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** That'd be creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Yeah, that'd be freaking cool, though.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** He's akin to Darth Jar Jar.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** He's the comic relief.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Jar Jar, yeah.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** The secret's like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Sith Jar Jar.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** You're a sad dancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Be like, oh man.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Yeah, that's a good segue.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** You guys ready to play?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Yeah, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** Let's keep talking about really heavy stuff right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Let's just keep going on it.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Let me... No, this is real.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Let's play.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Let's play.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Because what we were talking about before wasn't real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Here we go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Death's not real.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Nobody dies.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Last time...

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:10]** We've had you facing off with the last true warrior after Tez Tronin left in a flash, literally.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:18]** You were able to put two and two together and you know that Tez is actually a Salarian and that the flash was her supernova ability.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** The last true warrior left was a brute by the name of Michael, spelled M-A-E-K-O-L.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** I made that up myself.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:54]** but instead of fighting you guys were actually able to convince him to turn his back on the true warriors and you promised him new opportunities aboard the caduceus uh when you made your way back to junker's delight riddle kind of caught you in the alleyway beforehand and and let you into the back door and once inside uh var 13 started to explain why she ended where they ended up in the car yards uh so let's go back to that scene of the seven of you

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** in the lobby of junkers delight.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** Good.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** All right.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Um, so we get a full rest.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** No, not yet.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Relax.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** We'll get there.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** We'll get there.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Okay.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Okay.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** As the roof crashes in and a giant robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:17]** No, um, so very 13 robot comes in and tells you about death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** It's just a shock.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** And, uh, this is cremation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:32]** So VARI 13 explains to you that they recently began to remember snippets of VARI 8's life, a rare consequence of sharing the same android body.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** Thus, they began to examine their past, but they don't recall everything.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:48]** One particular vivid memory is that their progenitor running through the hallways to an escape pod on the Stellar Flare as it went down.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** I...

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:56]** I believe that the escape pod was damaged and that it did not make a safe landing on Akiton.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:06]** VARI-8 likely incurred their fatal wound in the crash, but they managed to embed the transponder codes into their escape pod in the last moments.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:17]** And I suspect that VARI-8 intended for one of their descendants, such as myself, to find this escape pod and thus the wreck of the Stoneheart Flare.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:32]** So VAR-13 was able to trace the beacon to Akiton and then Kafak Depot in the car yards, where you found out, or sorry, where they found what was left of the escape pod buried in the junk.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:41]** They managed to download a copy of the Stellar Flayer's transponder codes before the true warriors caught up to them and the Thessaron Kafak attacked.

**[00:13:42 - 00:14:07]** glancing off those encounters they refocus on the important topic i presume fire 13 says i'd have to somehow trace these codes to the starship because the stellar flares transponder must surely have been destroyed or or lost power but somehow the transponder is still broadcasting we should be able to find it with only a few hours work uh before i forget

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** Riddle does pay each of you 500 credits.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** As they promised.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** 500.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** 500 credits.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** As she promised for rescuing Var 13.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** And she also says, Yeah, and, uh...

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** I won't count those healing Syrians against you either.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** As you should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:35]** How many K'fok dogs can I buy with 500 credits with deflation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Well, K'fok dogs are, what, $2?

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Or two credits a K'fok dog?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** So, $1,000?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Okay.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** My math's right?

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** That's a lot of K'fok dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** When does... That's not Rollo's voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** When does K'fok... When does... You got one voice, John.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** You sound like a ninja turtle.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** One voice to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** I only have one.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** That's my only job.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Windows.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** My joke doesn't even land now because the joke was the voice.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Okay, sorry.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** That's right.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** The joke is your voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** No, I was going to say a joke and then I said it in the wrong voice.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** So the wrong voice became the joke.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** And now I'm explaining a joke, which is the funniest time for a joke is when you explain it.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** So thank you.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Yes.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Good night.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Good night.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** I'll see you later.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** I'm going to sign off now.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Bye.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** Goodbye, Rulu.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Jack?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** That was crazy.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Goodbye, Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Okay.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:41]** What kind of work is necessary to work through these transponder codes?

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:47]** Do you need any access to anything, or is it just pouring over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:15:47 - 00:16:00]** Oh, I definitely need to decode some of what I've been presented, but I also think that we would be able to triangulate the position if I could get some assistance, possibly.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** It's going to take a few hours, and it is very late.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** That would be you, Shaq, wouldn't it?

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** I'd be happy to take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:17]** If you have the energy, we all will need some rest and sustenance in order to face whatever may lie at these coordinates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:24]** Finally, finally, you all know the pain of being a caster and needing, like, a full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** Now you know why I push for it so much.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** Yes, I could use some rest.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** Not because my spell slots are at zero.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Oh, yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** All right, so really it is about probably 8 and 9 p.m.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** And you guys are talking about taking a rest.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:50]** Do you intend to stay inside Junker's Delight, or do you intend to go back out into Kvok Depot?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Do you guys need to do anything else?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** I just want to rest.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Just rest and go home, I guess?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Yeah.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** What?

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** So are you sleeping in Junkers Delight?

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:03]** Yeah.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Crash out on the chairs over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Would we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Are we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Yeah.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** Should we go outside and rest?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Did Riddle kick us out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** Are we good to stay here?

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** Riddle actually does, if you ask her, she'll throw up.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** She does have three cots available, but now there are seven of you.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** And there's a pot available for Chuck.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Oh, we're going to bunk up.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** It won't be comfortable.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:34]** If you choose to stay in Junkers Delight, I'm going to make you roll to see whether or not you're going to be exhausted the next day for at least a few hours.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** That's one thing.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** But you can also choose to go downtown.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** And 513 actually explains that they were staying over in a hotel in the casino.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** You could possibly take their room or get more rooms there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** Yeah.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:54]** I feel like it would be interesting to see the casino for flavor and story and all that.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** We might run into something interesting.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** At the same time, it might be a trap by Kevin.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** He just smiled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** He just smiled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** I changed my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:12]** This is definitely a metagame, but this is also an opportunity for you to shop with the 500 credits you were just given.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:19]** You can also do it in the morning if you want to rest first and then go out so that the trap is a little easier to handle.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Yeah, we should...

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** It's good to be rested, for real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:29]** Is there anything that you need from your room in the casino, Varee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** No, I think I have everything I need here.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** Thank you.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** But while you're having this conversation, you're talking about going out.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** Michael actually says, like, I think... Is this the voice?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** I don't remember.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Sorry.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Yeah, I think I can help you guys.

**[00:18:44 - 00:19:14]** uh and he pulls there's you know uh it's a guide shop so there's a bunch of maps on one of the counters near the front and one of them is a map of kafok depot and he pulls that out and he grabs a pen and he's like uh these are some of the areas i know that you'll run into you know i know you're trying to avoid uh the true warriors so he's gonna circle and and mark up the map to show you kind of where he's gonna give us the the cheat code to navigate right yeah

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** To avoid random encounters.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Fast travel past.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Yeah, fast travel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** I'm inclined to get a full night's rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** I think that's wise to do that first.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** So let's do it here, and hopefully we get a good sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:38]** But I don't know if we could all sleep here comfortably and, you know, get a full night's rest.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** I think some of us might be put out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** Well, Kevin, we have to roll, right?

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** Is exhausted mechanically going to, like, do anything?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** I am looking that up currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:52]** Also, Michael and Riddle need to take two of the cots, right?

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** Because we're not going to have them go out and stay at the casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** Well, Vahri and Michael would need cots.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Riddle has her own room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Nobody's taking her room.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Oh, I do see exhausted.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Here we go.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** Move half your speed, and you can't run or charge.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** That's a huge deal.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:14]** You take a minus three penalty to your armor class, attack rolls, melee damage rolls.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Oh!

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Thrown weapon damage rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** I'm really glad I introduced this.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** That is like the worst condition ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:27]** Reflect saving throws, initiative checks, and strength and dexterity based skill and ability checks.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** The amount of your bulk you can carry without being encumbered is reduced by three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** After one hour of complete rest, you instead become fatigued.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** Dang, there's no worse condition I've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** This is the worst.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** Can I just get coffee to not be exhausted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:47]** Is there cocaine in junkers?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:51]** I love that we fought a literal radioactive cockroach.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:58]** And the worst thing that would happen to us is a poor night's sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** Yes, I'm inclined.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** I really don't want to be exhausted ever.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Ever.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** A full night's rest in the casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** I don't really want to bunk with any of you.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** I'm sure we can make it there with Michael's help.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Let's do that.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** I think splitting up is probably not a good idea, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** Hang on, folks.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** I'm looking at this map that Michael gave us.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Looks like we might have some trouble getting to the casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Where's the casino?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Did I say casino?

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:43]** So just for the listener, I took the map of Kefauk Depot and I added a bunch of red blobs and I forgot that I added a big blob right around the casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Right around the casino.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Like the largest blob.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** You forgot or did you just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:21:50 - 00:22:02]** When I said the word casino, because I forget, this is getting into my GMing, but in early parts of part one, it tells you what hotel Vare stayed at, and I couldn't remember.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:06]** Anyway, so I was just like, first word that comes to my mind.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:14]** But what I will say is, yes, the hotel that they stayed at is definitely where the true warriors were.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:21]** And if you probe them a little more, Varya will actually tell you that that's where they first noticed the true warriors watching them.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** So it makes sense that they are following and tracking them.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Yeah.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:37]** But if you look at the map, the other numbers that are marked there, several of these locations are actually more like castle-casino hybrids.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** They're kind of like Las Vegas.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** They are each little fiefdoms with markets, shops, hotels.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Fiefdoms?

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Fiefdoms?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Fiefdoms?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Whatever.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** But...

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:56]** All of them have a hierarchy, and the water dealer is kind of on top of that hierarchy of the entire Kefauk region.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:02]** Hey, Michael, this casino spot looks pretty hot.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** There's a lot of pressure there.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:08]** Is there anywhere else you might recommend we could stay the night and get a good night's sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Do you have Motel 6 here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** I'm a Best Western Rewards member.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** We're always slamming it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:26]** I think there's a Best Western in the Monarch.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:34]** But, yeah, the casino is kind of where... That's where they put us up before we go to Jew Warrior Boot Camp.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** So, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Well, yeah, I don't plan on joining the boot camp.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:45]** I'm just looking for, you know, someplace I can use these points.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** So where would you guys like to go?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:54]** Clearly the casino is kind of off limits to you guys because that's where the Warriors are swarming thanks to where I randomly drew a circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** Is there like a barracks at the arena we could stay at or something?

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** Yeah, just whichever one of these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:06]** So the arena is probably the only place that doesn't have any kind of housing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** It's an entertainment venue.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** We could ask Riddle maybe.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** If there's a spot at the Monarch, let's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** Yeah, dude, the Monarch sounds baller.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** It sounds like a very chic place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** It's either that or the Necropalace.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:24]** Yeah, Necropalace is definitely like an Eoxian threshold.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** No.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** What about Examander's Throne?

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Yeah, Examander's Throne.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:33]** That's actually, I think, the one where Vary was staying in the book, but I changed that.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:38]** And then I was going to say, Cardival is kind of like Circus Circus.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Yeah.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** in Vegas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:47]** Yes, I wonder if they have a good steak dinner for $8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:53]** It says here that Ixomander's throne has breakfast until 10.30 instead of 9.30, so I think we should stay there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Good.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** Can we get a late checkout?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** You think maybe we should call ahead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** We'll call ahead.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Is there a way to call ahead?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** We'll call ahead.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:06]** I mean, is there like a Yellow Pages for Fuck Depot?

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** There's some way, right?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Infosphere to pull up the file.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** I was going to say, did no one bring a data pet?

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Yeah.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** We all have data pets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** There's also three computer terminals in the lobby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Yeah.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Okay.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:22]** So do I need to call Eximander Stone or can we just make a reservation right now?

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Is it the Monarch or Eximander that we're going to?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** Is it on Expedia?

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:44]** eoxpedia eoxpedia eoxpedia is actually only for it's all the advertisements for the necropolis you gotta scroll 15 pages in in order to find anything else


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Trivago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Trivago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** So we're going to stay somewhere else.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** And by we, I mean, I think Rolo is.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** So there are only three cots here.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Jack can stay here if he wants.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** And one other person can stay here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** All right.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Thaddeus will call up.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Are we splitting the party?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** I don't think we should do that, personally.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** But also, Thaddeus will call up Ixamander Stone.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Is that right?

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** On the infosphere?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** All right.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** I'm doing it.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** It goes to an automated... Oh, come on.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Thank you.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Welcome to X Commander's Throne.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:22]** If you would like to speak to hotel account... Whatever.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** I'm terrible at stuff.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:28]** If you'd like to speak to the hotel front desk, please go to... Or push one.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:32]** If you'd like to talk to... He pushes one aggressively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** And it rings for a little bit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Hi!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** This is Commander's Hotel.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** How can I help you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Yes.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:43]** I was wondering how much a room of yours is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:48]** It's going to be 57 credits a night per person.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** All right.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** All right.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Thanks.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Do you have breakfast in the morning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Breakfast will be available from 6 to 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** How much for plants?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:07]** Can we bring our own vegetation with us?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** Is that fine?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:09]** Do you allow pets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** Vegetation is allowed.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Pets will have a pet fee.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:23]** But I do have to let you know that the water is charged per the gallon as per the rules passed down from the water dealers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** So it's like one minimum, a gallon minimum, though.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** It's actually a $7 minimum per room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** How much is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** $18.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** All right, thank you.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:36]** Thaddeus, you're horrible at negotiating.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** What?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** All right, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** If you need anything else, let me know.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Have a good day, Mike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Click.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Yeah, later.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** No, there was negotiation.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** What are you talking about?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** Should we just try to stay with the water dealer?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** We'll figure it out.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** Alright, so it's like 57 credits a person a night.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Is that fine with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** I'm sure we can sneak Chuck in, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:01]** Didn't you ask about, you know, multiple reservations to give you a discount?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** We'll do that in the lobby.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** Do they have a group rate for pirates?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** Yeah, do you have a pirates discount?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** He calls them back.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** There's no answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** No, it's not happening.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** Let's go to you.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** They hang up on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** So rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** Service here is terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Alright, we should go.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** But I don't recommend splitting the party.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Splitting up, you know?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:39]** I just, I have a feeling that like the gods of this world, I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling that if there's an invisible hand, he's going to find some way to screw things up for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:43]** There's some kind of like, I don't know, game master floating above us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** It's like the hand at the end of Super Smash Brothers.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** That's actually pretty, pretty good.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:57]** So you're saying that all of us, our party plus very 13, far 13.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** And Michael.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Well,

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Well, I think Michael's going to join and work it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:07]** Vary and Michael will tell you they feel more comfortable staying at Junkers and that they'll be safe.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** And Riddle kind of confirms that.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:16]** She's going to tell you they have it very locked down and they'll keep an eye on things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** I think it's just us.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:22]** You know, we should come back and grab Vary and Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:27]** That's not my favorite, given the circumstances under which we found you, Vahri.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:34]** But if you feel more comfortable here, then we'll put our trust in Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:38]** I am very confident in Riddle's abilities to keep me safe, especially after hiring you.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** And she looks all of you.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** Or they look at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** To be fair, this was her second attempt to keep you safe.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** The first one didn't go so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:56]** Lorgan was very valiant in protecting me.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** If it was not for him, I would not be alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** Did he ever tell you that if he had a brother named Morgan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** No, I think he was an only child.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** So he told you his entire life story while you were hanging out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** We had... Oh, wait, go on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** He was so valiant.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** They actually dated for years.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** Sorry, Will, you were saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Oh, nothing.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** Should we call the carnival and see if they have a room available?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Alrighty.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:43]** Okay, well, let's just go to where we know we can stay and see if we can maybe haggle in the lobby for a group rate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:46]** You took the words right out of my mouth for me.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** All right.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:51]** We need a group raid, and do not let Thaddeus lead this conversation.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** It will do horribly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Yeah, I could try and work something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** All right, so where do you guys intend to go?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Ixamander Stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** That's where we call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** We will avoid the red area in between here and there.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** I need you to go into initiative order.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** So you guys are working your way through the city.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** You're walking on foot.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:09]** What time is it?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** Like eight, you said?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** Yeah, it's past dark, but not super late.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** Okay.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** You guys could wave down a taxi if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:42]** oh it's like a tech cab yeah how much is a cab on fact depot i'll say it's 30 credits for all of you we can split it i forget that it's a short walk yeah it's only oh how many yards whoever did the q uh 540 yards yep yeah what's that 1500 nothing also why are we going around the back way when you just go the front way


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:47]** Explain that to the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:57]** Playing with the arrows on the map, they were using the drop points and went almost in a full circle around the number seven.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** It wasn't clear where the front was.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** Okay, so you guys wander your way over there.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:17]** There is actually a point where you guys come up to an alleyway, and when you kind of step out, you notice off in the distance a group of clearly true warriors.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** I mean, a fairly large group.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** We're talking at least a dozen of them.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Where abouts?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:44]** where about on the map right here where the red mark is probably that red swath between us and our destination oh no roll 20 is not working I mean I went this way I thought oh you guys split up okay cool roll initiative


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:48]** But we see it out of the corner of our eye or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** How did we go?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** He was just saying we just see it from the edge.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:55]** Yeah, we just see an area where maybe on the other street.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** I'm going to just reveal a curtain a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** We know to avoid that area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:04]** It doesn't matter which direction you went and what casino you go to, you would have seen this.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** It's atmosphere.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** A little GM fact.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** Yeah, you guys just... They don't notice you.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** You guys continue on.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Very good stuff, everyone.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Good job.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:20]** So when you get to the casino, you kind of... They're all casinos.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** I'm going to call them casinos from now on.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** The castle... The fiefdom.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** You go in.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** You walk through.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** And of course, there's a fiefdom.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Didn't I say fiefdom earlier and you corrected me?

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Yeah, it's fiefdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** It's just messing.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** He's trying to sow discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Speaking of discord.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Join our discord.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** It's like...

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** You pass magical item shops, pawn shops, restaurants.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** Some of them are starting to close down, but a lot of them are still open.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:53]** Do you guys want to stop anywhere before you go to the hotel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Do we know if there's room service?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** You can order room service for additional fees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** Is this like our opportunity to purchase items before bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** Yeah, we'd like to purchase some stuff at the shop.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** By free, I meant available.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** Oh.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:59]** like there's not a whole lot of gun control laws so there is one shop that is uh specific for weapons in this area okay uh and they kind of all point you that direction could i also get a healing serum or two maybe we can talk about that once you're inside so you go into the store behind the counter there is uh nagaji i think it's how it's pronounced they are an ophidian or snake-like humanoid um they are wearing a nice suit that complements the pattern on his scales

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** No, that was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** Any overstock?

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:50]** You know, I trade a lot with a lot of different merchants on our ship.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** It's a lot like any of your sporting goods stores.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Yeah.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** And there is a wall of grenades.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** And there are some magical items.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** But in this shop, magical items are kind of rare.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** Seventy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Seventy zero.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Seventy seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** You know, a snake person would have more fun saying seventy-seven.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Or seventeen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** I can say seven multiple times.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** Seven.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Seventy.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** 77?

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** I have a total of seven serum.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** Is that Bob Shrapnel grenade I see over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Yes, I believe we have three of those available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Oh, I definitely want one of those.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:01]** I like the snake boy a lot.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** Is this a summoning grenade as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:09]** Yes, we have only one summoning grenade, though I can put some on special order for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Thank you.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** I don't think that would be necessary.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Is that...

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** You have a sticky, sticky bomb.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Don't do it.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:27]** Grenade and that scenery over there and a couple of frags.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** I think that'll do quite nice.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** Yes.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** Maybe a flash grenade if you got one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** Whatever you see on the shelves is currently what we have, but I might be able to put more on order for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Thank you.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** But they are there on the wall.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Check perks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** What are they?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** I don't even see them.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** What's this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** A Thasphalt grenade?

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** What's this promotion?

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** What?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** Is it because his cat?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** Is that why?

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** Look, I wasn't trying to culturally appropriate your language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** I see that you're trying to be sneaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** I don't think there's no sneakiness going on here.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Uh, come on.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** We can do better than that, can't we?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** Wait, how many would I be missing otherwise?

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:19]** I would miss out on two serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** How many serums do you have available for me again?

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** I have seven total.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:18]** Rolu just leans over as they are milling about and says, Do you have any armor upgrades?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:28]** Things to keep items unseen, some sort of concealment in compartments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** I believe we have armor upgrades over in the corner next to our special magic items.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Is there anything specific you're looking for?

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Concealed compartments.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Concealed.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:46]** I believe we do have a secret concealment equipment item.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** I'll go.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** What's it called?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Armor upgrade?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** I'll take it.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Yes.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** They ring that up for you.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** Does your plant friend want anything specific?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Yeah.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:02]** I'll take one of those bogus promotion fastfall blasters.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** $350.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** And I'll give it to you for $350.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** What's the credit to dollar conversion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** One to one.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** It's so hard to say not to say dollar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Can I make a diplomacy check to get him down to 300?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:22]** Yes.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** Go ahead and roll.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** Okay.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** So at this point, you guys all have your stuff on the table and you're going to offer to pay.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:38]** I'll let you do one solid diplomacy roll with no assists.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:47]** I mean, sorry, you could each do a single diplomacy roll for your cart, or you could do one diplomacy check for all of them, and you can all assist.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Who's the most diplomatic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:56]** I'm pretty diplomatic, and I have a pretty... I think I would have a lower DC at this.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** Based on my profession of merchant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Can you explain that a little further?

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:09]** So, according to my theme knowledge of profession merchant...

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:18]** I would have a, when attempting a culture or profession to recall knowledge about a commercial organization or business reduced.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** So that's not necessary.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** That's neither culture nor profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:29]** I'll say that you're able to like, you know, this is a chain amongst the PAX worlds and you're able to say like, well, I know there's a corporate rate for blah, blah, blah.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:55]** i'll give you that so you you could reduce the dc by you said five cool yeah okay so can we eight or is that just him really one what's your what's your diplomacy 10 yeah plus it's the same um i think i get a plus one circumstance bonus too from that same profession nice yeah we both because i've got con artists which is effectively the same thing oh we're talking about that

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** So you guys want to roll separately or you want to all roll together?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** He'll roll out of the system.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** I mean, I think odds we would.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** Can I assist or is it one assist?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** I'll give you up to two assists.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Kelly, what's your diplomacy?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** It's not.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** It's not.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** It's very intimidating.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Plus not.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Plus zero.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Cool.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:43]** uh cool so you guys set up for the night are you guys rotating staying awake or anything along those lines no as long as we can all get full arrests i'll take yeah i think that's the whole point i'll take full launch cool yeah first watch i should say

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** It's staggered so we can get full rest.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** I have the watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Cool.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:55]** So it's probably about 10 o'clock, 10 p.m., the equivalent on Akiton.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:01]** By the time you guys get settled into your rooms, you guys lock them, do the deadbolts, put the no, do not disturb signs out.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Who's taking first watch?

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** I think I'm going to order breakfast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** Do you guys want to get a bagel or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** Waffles would be good.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** Yeah, man.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** Cool.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** Chuck scrawls on the paper before he hangs it on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Does Chuck know this is, like, an open buffet?

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Wait, did we sleep already?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Putting it out, like, hanging it.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:31]** I think he's unaware of, like, the quality of this place.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:35]** Like, he's just scrawling on the paper and hanging it on the door, expecting it to be there when he gets up in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** So...

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Thaddeus takes first watch.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** How many hours is your first watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** I have to do some math here.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** Uh, well, I guess we all need to sleep eight hours.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:52]** So the math is, I have no idea, but basically it was four of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:56]** So, um, you're going to do like two hour shifts.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Yeah.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Yeah.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Two hour shifts.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** So who's taking second watch?

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Um, Rolu.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Okay.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:09]** So Rolu's up the rest of your sleep and Rolu's just about to wake up whoever's next.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** And some happens.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:40]** course he hears this like rumbling down the hallway just like smashing against the walls type thing you know real loud and then there's a pounding on your door specifically rollo's door well the out of the two doors that you have the one there's a of the room that rollo's in sure yes the room that you are currently in there's a pounding on the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** I don't hear this.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** I'm in the other room.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** Who is sleeping with Rolo?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Is it Torme or is it Jack?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** We'll say it was Jack.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Okay.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Jack?

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** He's just out of sleep.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** He's got his noise-canceling headphones on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Okay.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** Yeah, Thaddeus just has a little eye mask on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:08]** Rolo's gonna, like, nudge Jack and not go to the door yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Pounding doesn't stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** I know you're in there!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Come out!

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:22]** Rulu tells Chak to message the others and then Rulu's going to go look through the little people to see who it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** We'll say it's got a slider thing.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** You slide the thing open, you look through it.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:33]** You see a hilky woman right in front and there are two androids, a male and a female, standing behind them.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Go ahead and give me a perception check.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** You give me a percentage.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** 21.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** 21.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:47]** Okay, so from that perception check, you don't see any colors or any markings or tattoos that indicate that they are true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Check sends a text message.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Suit up.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** There's something going down in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:05]** Ralu is going to put one hand on his weapon, his melee weapon, and he's going to say, Identify yourself.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Don't f*** around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** You know who this is.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Come on.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Come out.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Seeing that move, Jack is going to grab his new blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** And they're still pounding.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** Every time they speak, they're hitting the door hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Okay.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:19]** Is the door starting to give, or does it look like it's going to hold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** I mean, it looks like it'll hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Okay.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Our Torme... Tell him to go away.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:30]** I'm going to open the sweet door to see if Torme and Thaddeus are...

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** I need you to... Rolo's going to... Wake me up?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** What's going on?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:45]** Rolo's going to shout back to the door and say, I need you to identify yourself or you won't get anywhere here and you'll be met with hostility only.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Oh, he's f***ing with us now.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:47]** Come out.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** You know who you're there.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** We know Verano.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Just come out here.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** Who?

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Verano?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** We know you're there, Verano.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** Pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Check.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** There's no Verano here.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** You have the wrong door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:04]** And as you say that, you hear a clack, clack down the hall.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** No, I'm over here.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** I told you.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** 392.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** And your guys' number is actually 394.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:18]** And she looks at the number and puts her eye up to the people and is like, sorry about that.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:23]** And as she walks away, you can see that they're pretty drunk.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:31]** And they barrel to the other room laughing loudly about the mistake and the door slams shut behind them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** False alarm.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** You almost killed an innocent woman.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** I'm getting a discount on this rate for this f***ing hotel.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** This is against the chapter 72 innkeeper laws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Cool.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** So, nothing else happens throughout the night.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** You guys wake up.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** Do you guys do anything else before you grab breakfast, I'm assuming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Yeah, you got puffatures.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Those Dutch mini pancakes.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** I mean, those mini pancakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:06]** Before that happens, I think Rolu, when he gets up, he is scrolling through his data pad.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:14]** And I think maybe when Jack steps to the bathroom, Rolu pulls up.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:33]** his data pad and then he you can't see what individual or number he puts in as the address but he sends a message uh that says um i've got some buyers and i think i'm ready to sell my paintings he types that in and sends that off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Okay.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:42]** Does anybody else have anything else they're doing throughout the night or during their time on watch before they get up and leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Yeah, I do have...

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:51]** So Thaddeus closes the door between these two attached rooms.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** And he's like, I just have to use the bathroom.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** It's going to be really loud.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** He just closes it.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Sorry.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** And then he talks to Torme.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** He's like, Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Good morning, Torme.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Yeah.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Hold on a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:13]** I just need some water real quick.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I'll get that real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** So to me, just like kind of fidgets waiting for him to come back.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** What's up, man?

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:24]** What were those drug fools earlier?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Did you hear that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** No, I slept pretty soundly.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** To me.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Did you get any?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** Did you get any more messages or did those messages finish downloading for you from earlier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Yeah.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** So they just said, stick to the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** No, not those messages.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** The messages between that ship, what was it called?

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** The Knave's Revenge.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** The Knave's Revenge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** So they finished downloading, did they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** There was some, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Would you mind if I take a look at them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** I'm really tired.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Can I just get a little bit more sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_16

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:06]** Go get some coffee.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Tomei hands you his data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** I just sent it to him.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** Pack it, send, airdrop, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:19]** So Thaddeus opens up.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:26]** the list of messages and takes a deep breath and clicks on the first message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:31]** Message one, Shira Dawnbreaker to Caduceus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:37]** This is Shira Dawnbreaker, first mate of the Knave's Revenge.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:44]** This will be the first of a brief series of messages for Rolu to aid in his transition to the Knave's Revenge.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:53]** I was told by your comms officer that private messages are not permitted to individual members of your crew during the onboarding phase.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:56]** That is highly irregular, but...

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** If we must cooperate along those lines, we will.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Requesting Level 1 access.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:09]** Thank you and out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:15]** Roloo, I've sent the remainder of your belongings to the station you've requested.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** You can pick them up when you're there.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:23]** Also, thank you for providing the details for your final order of shirts from our tailor.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Looks like but ten shirts.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** I will make sure those get to him.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** She-Ra out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01
