**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** I'm Kevin Decker, your GM.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]** And I'm going to start my timer because I never do that.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:05]** It's started.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:07]** It's official.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** Time is on.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Way to go, Kevin.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** You're so on the ball tonight.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Dude, well done, Kev.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** You're the best.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Just right.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Just right.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:20]** Starting off the new year perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Dude, you're good.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:24]** If you keep doing this for every other episode that you have to GM, you'll be perfect.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** That's how this works.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** Paizo actually sends you an award.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** I meant because it's a new year.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Happy New Year, everyone.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Happy New Year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** It's 2023.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** It's 2023.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Officially.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** We made it out of 2022.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** That's a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** We get to talk about this like this.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:48]** Hopefully this will be the year that things in life get better for the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:57]** I think that's my question for the week is like, how long, how long can you continue to say like happy new year and like new, new changes and all that fun stuff?

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Is it like a week, a month?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** I think, I think after a week it gets a little old and we're, we're in the cusp.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** We're four days into the new year technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:14]** So I think it is good up until almost however long you want to say it, as long as you haven't seen that person.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:19]** And then when you see them, it could be June and you'd be like, oh, I haven't seen you since 2022.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Happy New Year.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** And they'd be like, oh, you're the funniest.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** And then it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** Yeah.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:32]** Unless you want to create a running gag where you can pretend you haven't seen the person.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]** And then every time you see them, you can just be like, oh, Happy New Year.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** I haven't seen you since last year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** I'm going to do this to John for the rest of my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** Just pretend that you have dementia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:49]** I think it's a combination of both of those where it's...

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:58]** Little call me and call me, but mostly I, my take is within the timeframe of when you're still writing the wrong year on dates.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** And then you say it ironically to people like, Oh yeah.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Happy new year guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** That's I think writing the date wrong, but I'm going to take Vinnie's approach.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** And for the rest of my life, every time I see John be like, Oh,

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Happy New Year.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Happy New Year, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** It's 2023 forever.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Be stuck in time.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** It's going to be 2055.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:19]** Hey, John.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:23]** And then you could just be like, wow, like that Roosevelt, right?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** My God.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Just like, you know, be stuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** It's just Will.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Just dementia.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** You're just appreciating Will.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Will just live forever.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** He's like, Happy New Year.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** I don't know what time is.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I live outside of time, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** New year, old year, it doesn't matter.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** It's just, it's just time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Thank you.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** I hope you do that to me.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** I will hold you to it.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Cause if you don't,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** The thing is, every time I say something like that, I forget it immediately.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** So I don't remember what we're talking about.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** So you have the short-term memory loss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** He actually has it.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** So this is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Oh, because he did say that he's like a goldfish, remember?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** He is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Kevin, Happy New Year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Happy New Year, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** It's a new year?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Wow!

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** Happy New Year!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Nuclear power is perfectly safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** I blame Diet Coke more than anything else.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** For nuclear power?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** No.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Not Dr. Pepper?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** How's Diet Dr. Pepper?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** It was like the aspartame in Diet Coke that eats holes in your memory.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Is that a real thing?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** I believe so.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** I believe it.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** He doesn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** He's got holes in his memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** How would he know?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:39]** Did the Navy give you Diet Coke before it was available to the public?

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Because you were test subjects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** No.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** In fact, there's no soda on Submarine.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** What?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** They don't give you that.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** You can bring your own.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:54]** I used to bring my own hat for special occasions, but they called it bug juice.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** What is bug juice?

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** That makes sense.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** It's like orange juice or guava juice.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Ew.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** It comes in a... But it just attracts bugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** Well, I mean, that's fine, but they just have that on repeat all the time.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Kevin, why...

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** We talked about it, I guess.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:15]** I still find it surprising that you just joined the Navy and you're just like, I want to do the worst possible thing ever in the Navy.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** I'm going to be underwater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** It was not the worst thing ever.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** Plenty of other jobs are much more terrible than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** All right.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Fair enough.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** It is cool that you did nuclear shit, I have to say.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** It's cool for stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** For the record, I didn't bring this up.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** That was not me.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** This one doesn't count towards my Navy story counts.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** I'm just saying.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** They always count.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** They always count.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Yeah.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** No.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:44]** There's like a Navy gravity that just when you happen to fall into the Navy well, you know, then you start talking stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** We're all stuck in it.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** We're in like a whirlpool of it.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Yeah.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Here we go again.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Like Team Rocket.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** We're just like spinning towards the center of the vortex.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** And there's a Kraken.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Periscope comes up.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** It's Kev.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Kevin's a Meowth.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** He's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** Kevin, Pokemon was a show from the early 1990s.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** It's a Japanese show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** I just feel like you wouldn't know what it is.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** I know what Pokemon is.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I was a part of the originals.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** That was mine.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** Kev was number 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** That's right.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** He was.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:49]** and then we captured him and they were just like do this podcast I just I just saw a thing not too long ago that was like Ash Ketchum finally yeah won the championship oh thank god yeah 25 years he finally got it like congratulations congratulations congrats to Ash it only took being reborn 20 times he is the perfect employee he's the 10 year old with 25 years of experience exactly

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Who was his first fight?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Was it against Brock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** I think it was.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** I think it was Brock first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:28]** I mean, I thought it was him and Pikachu against a whole flock of Pidgeys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Oh, yeah, that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** That wasn't in the gym, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** That was just in the field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:38]** It was technically against Pikachu because Pikachu electrocuted him, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** They had some beef when it first started out.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** It was not a great relationship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** No, it wasn't.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** First gym battle.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** Yeah, John.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]** It's Pewter Gym against Brock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** Pewter Gym.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** Brock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Called it.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Man, look at that.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** All right, Kevin.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Kevin doesn't know what Pokemon is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** And I have a shitty memory.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** Happy New Year, Kevin.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** But I managed to pull that one out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Happy New Year.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Yeah, happy New Year, Kevin.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** I guess it came full circle and stuff.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I'm sorry I made fun of you for not knowing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** We left off at another form of Poke Battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** We did.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:13]** We did?

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** Is that Will Q in the app?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Is the Electrophore going to reprise this role?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Oh, no.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Okay.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** Wait, I'm confused on the Pokemon reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** It was a battle.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** Don't we have a battle royal going on right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** Because you guys had like the Electrovor and there were a couple of like the summon.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** But yeah, if you want to just jump into it, let's play.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:50]** I went to the future and I see what happens when you don't shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** Yeah.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Everyone on Discord gets upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** I'm sorry, we were talking about Pokemon battles and I'm just like, oh, there's another battle.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** That's like the best thing to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** Will doesn't know what's going on because he's beyond it.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** He's too old for Pokemon.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** Will is experiencing the past future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** He's over there at present simultaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** Will's over there like, I'm a Yu-Gi-Oh guy.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Or a Digimon guy.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Or Digimon.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** It's actually kind of good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Wait, we're playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** Unpopular opinion, and then we can get into it.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Digimon was way more entertaining than Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** I mean, it had a better story, for sure, because things actually happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** I'm willing to entertain your arguments, yes.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Next banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** I feel like you can drop that gauntlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Put that in the notes.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** Unpopular opinion, hot take.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Begin episode.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Alright.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:51]** Listeners, tell us about your favorite child battle show.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** Or if you're like Will and you watched Astro Boy growing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:02]** I don't know if I told you guys this one, but we went over to our friend's house and they had a trampoline and Grayson was still in the car.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** So him and I were sleeping in the car.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** And then we woke up and we're like, oh, look, there's kids playing in the trampoline.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** And there were four kids in the trampoline with shields and swords.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** They were foam.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** No, nothing crazy.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** They were foam swords.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Love it.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** And then I go in the backyard and I was talking to the dad and he's like, yeah, I'm, I'm creating my own tournament.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:27]** It's like, it's going to be like, bring me your kids.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** He's like, whoever wins, I'm going to fight them.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Oh my God.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Oh my God.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** That dad's name, Michael.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** Close.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:37]** It's Micah.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Micah, I'm calling you out.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** I'm sure he was, he was kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I'm very, you know, I think he's creating the first neighborhood gym.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** He's the gym leader.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:48]** This is how a gang starts.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** One day with augmented reality, we'll have like some real fucking Pokemon games.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** It'll be great.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** All right, Kev.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** I'm putting it in the notes.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Digimon versus Pokemon.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Next week, we're going to hear it out.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I want to hear the arguments.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I'm all for it.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** But yeah, let's play.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Here's my summary.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** Last time, you met back up with Merc, Kesh, and Vahri XIII.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:15]** You delivered the parts and described battles before Merc ran off to finish that EMP key.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:24]** Rolu Terme offered to assist while Chak and Thaddeus got a little history lesson about the land surrounding the Great Wreckage.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** Merc finished off the EMP and ran over to the sealed doors of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** While she was getting that set up, you noticed Kesh was a little uneasy.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:40]** And Kesha's concerns soon became a very real reality.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:48]** Bumguzzle and a horde of space goblins approached, angered about the slaying of Tinkerton.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** And then Torme and Chak were able to persuade them, kinda.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:25]** By calling it Saying they did it because it was a calling From Triune themselves So good Except Chuck didn't know when to stop And failed that last check That last Chuck But before it got any worse They totally forgot about that But before it got any worse Chuck was drunk on power at that point Yeah I'll take it I flew too far Flew too close to the sun Flew too close to the drift


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:33]** But before that got any worse, a Sashla and the unbrewed clambered over the other side of the junk pills.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** And after a short stare down, battle ensued.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** Will this be the final battle of the mid zone?

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Let's take you back to the maps.

**[00:12:41 - 00:13:10]** the mid zone wait is that like prophesied or something final battle of the mid zone can i roll a culture check the area that we're in it's like not quite the outer zone it's a mid zone between cat back this is the mid zone and and kesh told you uh that this is where many battles between the uh unbrewed and the trash hunters happen so we're on the map now you can see it uh there's lots of kestis on the right with lots of goblins on the left it's the final battle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:16]** It is the final battle of the mid zone.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** And does that have any significance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:23]** Like this is a big fight between the two, the two groups, the cash.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Yeah.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Trash hunters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** The, the, the goblins versus the cash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** We're caught in the middle.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** This is like spilling the tea.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** It's kind of winter takes all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:38]** This is, this is, this is, this is the rumble at the end of West side story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Yeah.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Yeah.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** One thing I forgot to do last time was actually show you images.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Drop these on here.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:48]** Show to everyone because artwork in this book is awesome.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Oh, wow.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** Can you show those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** They didn't pop up on my screen.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** I saw them.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Guzzle.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Bomb guzzle.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** So we have a Sashla.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Is it a giant Keshti?

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Giant.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Not actually giant, just large by definition.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Somebody would describe her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Uh, she's a huge lizard.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** She kind of looks like Godzilla, basically.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** I don't really know what else to say.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** She has, like, these, like, tusks coming out of her face.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** She looks pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:23]** She's red, scaled, muscular, with these sort of, like...

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:39]** looks like bandages or like 20 pack abs, maybe tassels that were bandages for like sparring, you know, like, uh, like training as well as like a, a tunic of some sort, deep red tunic.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:45]** But like a scaly body with like horns and like claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:50]** Very sharp claws and a ring on her right middle finger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** Also, she might have... Her biceps are massive.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** Also, she has giant spikes going down her spine, sort of.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** It's kind of cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:03]** I do wish I had an image of Frog to throw up next to her because they are the same creature.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** They're both riveners.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** I believe the females get a little bit larger.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** But...

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Let's look at the other one, Bomb Guzzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Bomb Guzzle.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Yep.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** Bomb Guzzle has like 120 teeth.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Yeah.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Very tightly packed.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** Imagine like a giant goblin head inside of a... Mech suit.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Junk Gundam.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** Yeah.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Yeah.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** That's it.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** Pretty appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Yep.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:34]** And the right shoulder is like some... Looks like an old, I don't know, pistol with a scope.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Artillery or something.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** It's like steampunk looking.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** It's like an Acme cannon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:38]** Yes.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** I can see that.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** The whole left arm ends in these massive claws.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:47]** I'm hoping that Bomb Gozzle has all of these weapons in actuality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** Edward Scissorhands on the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Kind of normal on the right.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Yeah.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** I feel like you're about to find out because we are in the middle of combat.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** We rolled for initiative last time.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** We did.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** We did.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:00]** We did.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** I have your numbers all written down.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:19]** cool oh and it's actually rolu's turn first stop man i was really hoping you wouldn't say that just a cold open i gotta jump in not knowing i had what's so cold about it it looks like it's hot it's hot

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** All right.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** So just just for the listener.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** So this area here is called the mid zone.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:30]** It's a large open field with all sorts of debris spanning out from the entrance to the stellar flare.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** And I just for anybody who's looked at this map before, I turned it and rotated it to make it a little more interesting.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** appealing to myself.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:42]** So the entrance to the stellar flare is at the very top of this map and it spans downward.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** And then we have spread out throughout the map.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:52]** We have Merc, Vari 13 and Thaddeus are kind of uptight against the door of the stellar flare.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** And we have cash just to the right of the door.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:02]** Then you come down just a little bit and we have Treme and Chak are standing within arm's length of bomb guzzle.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:32]** rolu happened to step in between uh asashla and bomb guzzle because asashla is down kind of diagonally to the right about i don't know what 20 feet and then to the right we have one two three four five uh smaller kestis and then on the left we had one two three four five six seven goblins but one of them was crushed instantly just boom by asashla before this fight even happened

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** All right.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** Now that I described all that, did I leave anything out?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** You ready to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Ready to roll.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** It's good.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Let's roll.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Let's roll.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** Rolu?

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:52]** Rolu, I think, turns on his heels seeing all this happen so quickly as, I think it was Asasla who just said, like, let's freaking go, right?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Ambushed.

**[00:17:53 - 00:18:12]** led the initiative there and I think you see Rolu moves his robes back out of the way as he is going to take total defense as a standard action and is going to start to move back towards the line up north of the map 10 feet back and

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:40]** and is going to move towards the entrance because he is thinking of protecting that entrance and not wanting to get involved in the combat kev and just just to be clear total total defense gives you plus what four four to your eight to your ac let's put that to work because you just moved out a threatened square no way okay all right for real of course i did of course of course i did so the 10 foot reach of the rivener


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** That's right.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** You were one square away.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** That's a 19 to hit.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Does 19 hit with your plus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Against what?

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** KAC.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Unfortunately, it does.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** But 19.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** I have a 19.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** You literally got it.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** Of all freaking numbers you could have rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:04]** So just as you try, she reaches out and just grabs the back of your neck.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:08]** Vulcan neck pinches you and now you're unconscious.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** That's right.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Holy slashing tight.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** God dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Everyone avoid that one.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Wow.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** That's like the big one, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Yeah.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** I think Rola was trying to say something like, back up.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** We need to stay out of this until we know who we can focus our attacks on.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** And then focus our attacks.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** And then just gets like.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:54]** cut in the back while trying to move out of the way thanks kev that was super nice of you buddy you're welcome yeah thanks for playing into that uh termay it's your turn is that your full turn that was that was your full turn was full defense yeah is full defense a standard action standard action okay so full defense and then walked away and it didn't do anything to help it almost did almost termay i'm gonna take a guarded step back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** And then I'm going to cast.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** Actually, I'm going to delay and see what they do as far as like attack.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Can I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** I think it's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** You're pretty close to the top of the turn order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Do it.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** You can delay.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** You can't delay your full turn.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** You'd have to do ready in action at this point because you spend.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** I'm going to ready in action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Okay, you have to give me what you're going to do and the trigger.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** Okay.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:27]** And just to know, if it is an offensive maneuver that you're going to do, then whatever the trigger is happens first.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** But if you're doing strictly defensive, then the trigger happens second.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Does that make sense?

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** Yes.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** I'm going to use my final spell slot.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:46]** And I'm going to cast Adamantine Shot on a regular old round.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:54]** Thanks to the firm for the update on using Adamantine Shot.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Nice.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** Thanks, Brules Paralegals on Discord.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** And who are you going to target?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** I'm going to need you to tell me that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** So I'm going to target whoever is being the aggressor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** Whoever's the aggressor or whoever's targeting you.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** I don't know if I can just let you choose the aggressor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Whoever's targeting me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Okay.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I will give you that.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:18]** So you're going to ready an adamantine shot to target whoever is attacking you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** And you're okay with losing that spell.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** I guess you wouldn't lose a spell because you don't technically cast it then if you aren't targeting.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Right.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Okay.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** All right.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** As long as that's all clear, we're all under an understanding there.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Chalk, it's your turn.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** But before you do anything, you notice again, there's just this war raging in the background.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:43]** There are Kestis on one side launching all sorts of magic missile and stuff like that at the goblins.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:49]** And then on the other side, you have the goblins shooting their junk lasers and building barricades and hiding behind things.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** It's just chaos across this war field.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** So what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** Chalk is going to... Excuse me.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Sorry.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Chalk is still sick.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** Chalk is going to turn to Bumgozzle.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** He's still sort of drunk with power.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** And say, I killed your god.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** You can't touch me.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Oh, shut up.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Shut up, Chalk.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Please.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Holsters.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** That's going to be his not in the face action.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** So please make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** We'll save.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Okay.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** We'll save.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** We'll save.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** For Shaq.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Wow, Keller, you really just... Because of Shaq.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** There's so much energy for that we'll save.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** What's it going to be, Kevin?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** What's your we'll save?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Kev, what's your we'll save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** I'm looking up the will.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** Slow down.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** Kev, what's your we'll save?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Tell us, Kev.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** We want to know.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** It's a 14.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Oh, 14, 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** Time to go to the roller.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** That's super duper annoying.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:52]** I'm going to put away my light fast fall blaster and pull out my combat knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Nice.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Okay.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** So not in the face is a move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** It is, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** And then you're using your standard action to pull your weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** To put away my blaster and to pull out my knife, yeah.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Okay.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** And that's your turn?

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** And that's both actions I've allotted, yeah.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** There we go.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Very impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Well, this is interesting.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** It's now Asashla's turn.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** And she is going to just march forward.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** I'm going to kill you all!

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:29]** As she steps forward to here.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Where is here?

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Hmm.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:52]** why don't you explain where here is and then two steps forward towards everybody to be within range of everybody well at least rolu and and shock are this is basically basically tpk yeah that's right yeah let's do it um well there's technically

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:58]** There are four of you in my targeting range, so I'm going to roll dice one through four, going clockwise.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:04]** We're going to start with Bomb Gozzles one, Chalk is two, Treme three, and Rulu is four.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Let's see, who does she go for?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** That is a two on the dice.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:16]** So she steps forward, and she just reaches out for Treme.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** No, Chalk.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** I said Chalk.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Yeah, you said clockwise.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** That's Chalk.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** That's right.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** My bad.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** You're not in the face only works on bomb guzzle.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** It didn't work at all.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** He passed the DC, but it would have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Oh God.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** I'm going to kill someone.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Aren't I?

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** That's a 22 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** Come on, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** This poor plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Yo.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** It's a plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** There's no bonus for meeting my KZ plus eight, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:46]** No, unless I'm doing something or other.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Okay, cool.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** A combat skill.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** So that hits, you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Yes.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Yes.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** Indubitably.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** Indubitably.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Without a doubt.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Chalk is wrecked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** That is only nine points of damage.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Slashing tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Oh, just nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** But you're weak against because you're a plant, right?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Pokemon.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** Plant type is vulnerable to slash.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** That's true, isn't it?

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** It's true.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** God dang it.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** That was a good one.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Are we live still, Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Yeah, I'm good.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** I've just mismanaged my health for a minute.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** You said that's nine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** That's nine to hit, yeah.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Or nine points of damage, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Pokemon!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** I've still got three stamina points.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:27]** Okay.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** And I've got six hit points.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Oh, wow.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Yikes.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** Chuck's gonna die!

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** No, Chuck.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** And it's now Bomb Gozzle's turn.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** So he's within arm's reach of Asashla.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** He's close enough to attack Chak.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** And Chak is the one saying all sorts of stupid shit to him at this point.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** And he's growling between the two of them.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** No.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:59]** But he's going to take a guarded step back, away from Asashla, and ready his cannon.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** Yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** What?

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Let's see if I can hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Kamehame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** I'm pretty sure that hits.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:17]** That is a 26 against her easy to beat KC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Oh, that's good to know.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Nice little drop there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Yeah, okay, cool.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Sweet.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Thanks, buddy.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** And that's going to be...

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Only four points of damage.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:33]** So that shoulder cannon readies itself, comes down.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** It's rattling and clanking, and there's little pistons moving on it.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:46]** It goes, and this laser beam hits her right in the shoulder, and she kind of just winces a little bit and shakes it off.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** So then...

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** Four points of damage.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Bam.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** All right.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** I'm actually really excited about this.

**[00:26:51 - 00:27:00]** I set this on the Excel sheet, and I don't know why I did this sooner, but I have all the details kind of written out, but then I have all this extra room from where I have your guys' information that I didn't put in.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** So what I did was I made an equation to where...

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:10]** Any damage I have, I can just throw in any square above or below, and it takes away the damage from the appropriate bad guy.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** I'm just very proud of myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** That's cool.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** You should share it.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** It's a proprietary.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** I'm going to keep it to myself.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** Or is it owned by Wilson?

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** Shoot.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** You own one.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** I didn't read the fine print.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:29]** Oh, rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Kevin.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Well, this is an interesting turn of events.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Thaddeus, what are you going to do?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:39]** Thaddeus is just like, well, looks like now we know who we need to kill.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** I recommend everyone stay a distance.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:47]** Step, do guarded tactical treats and fire from a distance.

**[00:27:47 - 00:28:08]** tactical retreats everything all right and then he's gonna he's at a distance but he's gonna move a little bit further back because you know that right and then uh looks like he has a pretty open shot he's moving the tent he's just gonna maintain a distance from this guy so he's

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** No, slow down.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Listen, okay, hold on.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Thaddeus, all right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:18]** Thaddeus says, I'm going to take a tactile retreat and then says, excuse me, as he squeezes between a small goblin and a helpless android.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** Okay, all right.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** He's taking advantage from the doctor, okay?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Rule of tactics.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** You guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:28]** I just, like, flick s*** as I move around to, like, you know.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Now hold on now.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** Thaddeus, you have to give him respect for the fact that he has done this s**t for a very long time.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** This is what he does.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** He knows what he's doing.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** Also, he doesn't give a s**t about this goblin.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** He doesn't care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** Our weapons officer, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Is that how you killed all those Kasathans?

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** From a distance?

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Behind other people.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Behind other people.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Behind other people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** All right.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** Look, there's a method behind this.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** So, but for real, maintain your distance.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:04]** And he's going to shoot, you know, a Sashla.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** And here we go.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Here we go.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** So, auto-target rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:13]** Don't forget, that's now soft target, or soft cover, because you step behind two innocent people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Does he really?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** After all the weird, like, cover conversations we've had.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** After stepping behind somebody?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Yes, you get soft cover.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** No, but, like, I'm literally between the two of them.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** You're passing through their squares in order to hit a soft cover.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** That is soft cover.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:23]** My bad.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Then I'll just go here.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Okay.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** All right.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Where's here?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** So now.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Right.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** Slightly in front of him.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** All right.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** You know what?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** I'm here.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Now I'm not behind anyone, Kevin.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** That was where you were.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** So now I'm going to, like, shoot.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** You took a step back.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** That wasn't where I was.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** That's where I was.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Oh, it's one step back.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** It's a 22 to hit.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** That hits.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Definitely hits.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** All right.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** KC?

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** That hits.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Three damage.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Hooray.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Three damage.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** And what are you shooting?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** That's the venom caster?

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** That's the venom caster.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** There's no venom in this shot.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** All right.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** All right.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** He, like, pings her in the face.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** In, like, the nostril.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** In the face.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Yep.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** And she snorts it.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Now stay away.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Badass.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:31]** yeah yeah okay so that is the end of that round but what i'm gonna do now is actually move kesh murk and uh vari 13 out of the way because they are gonna just cower in fear much like thaddeus tried to do oh wow yeah and so they're gonna jump in yeah murk is actually gonna run up and around on top of uh the little hill that goes up and over the door yeah of the um stellar flare

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Vahri is going to run out and behind the tent.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Oops, I'm going to move the whole tent on accident.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Whoa, did the tent just move?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** The tent was moving too.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** I'm sorry.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** I should have put the tent in the background.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** I'm going to move that down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Oh, great.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** The tent's an ally.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:50]** I'm going to move it to the map later so I don't do that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** Also, thanks again, Michael, for not coming along to help out.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** Michael, is that you behind the tent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Is that you?

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Who knows?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:04]** You left Michael with Riddle, and he may still be a true warrior at heart.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Just saying.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Don't, but not in reality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Don't do this to me, Kev.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** This is not the three-fold conspiracy, sir.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:14]** I don't need that much paranoia in this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Seven-fold.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** Three-fold extended.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Avenged seven-fold.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** End of round number one.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Moving into round number two.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:31]** I thought about doing some clever work with rounds and affecting things, but I didn't on my Excel sheet.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** I left it alone.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:35]** Round number two is now Rolo's second turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:35]** All right.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** Rolo is going to say, Chalk, I'm going to need you to listen to me.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:44]** You need to get out of range of this demon.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:48]** And then Rolo is going to take a guarded step back.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** And hopefully that obviously does not encourage.

**[00:31:52 - 00:32:21]** current ao because i think i was in range so it takes a five foot step back and as uh are you saying a guarded step or five foot sorry a guarded step backwards and two and his two lower hands scoop his robe so that way he doesn't trip as he starts shuffling backwards and his upper two hands quickly cast blessings of youth so that way he can get some of his stamina points because fyi rolu was at 9 of 14 hit points and no stamina

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** So any other hit and I think Rolo could have been down.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** Yeah.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Good call.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Good call.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Yeah.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:31]** So going to cast that and get some stamina points back.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** And I rolled an eight max stamina points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Oh, yes.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Dude, I love to see it.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** You love to see it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** Plus five foot enhancement to the target's land speed for one round.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** But I'm not going to use it.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** And that's my turn.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** That's a beautiful turn.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** I love it.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Thank you.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Terme, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:53]** Seeing clearly that my opportunity was wasted to attack.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** I am now going to attack, but I'm going to take another guarded step first.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Yes.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** Take a guard step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Diagonally away from a Sasha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Yep.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Yes.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Yep.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** It does.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** We've left chalk for a sacrifice.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** Well, I mean You did bring it on yourself Chuck.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:26]** Get out of there quick It's just like literally Getting hella far away from this dude just like on to the edge of the map We don't want and I'm gonna cast at a man teen shows Do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:34]** So I roll three times and then for each one of those I can roll a d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** You're attacking who?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** The big bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** There's two big bads.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** There's a bigger bad and a little big bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** The biggest bad.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Asashla.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** He's attacking Sandy Claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Sandy Claws.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** The one that attacked Chalk.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** It's accurate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Did it attack Chalk?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** He just wants to give us presents.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** She did.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** She crushed Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Slashed him.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Rough.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Okay.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Natural 20 on the first one.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** Ooh, that is a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** It's just a flat D8.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Roll that D8 twice, please.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:17]** I'm actually, I'm not sure if that's on the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Are you saying you can't crit on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** Would it?

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Ooh, it's a good question.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** Let's see if we can do this in record time.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Adam Mantine shot Starfinder.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Let's see if we can see if it crits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** I don't have my slack open.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Somebody asked the rules lawyers.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** Give me Discord.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:33]** That's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** Ask on Discord the rules.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Why wouldn't it crit?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** There's nothing saying it doesn't.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** No, now I'm arguing it.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** It doesn't crit.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Why?

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:52]** Because Will objected to his own... That's like declining a... No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:56]** Asking the rules barely holds hold on.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** I was just wondering if it did or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Because I roll three times.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** What's the question that I can ask Jeremy, Jeff, etc.?

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** What if I got three crits?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** That'd be crazy.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** That would be crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** You also have to run the odds of you getting three crits.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** That's one in, what is it, 20 cubed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** While we're talking about this, what is your bonus?

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** What are you applying for this?

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** Do you have a ranged attack?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** Or are you doing your spell attack?

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** Because I think it should be ranged, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:27]** Add a manatee and shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** It has the knockdown critical hit effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:52]** yeah oh there it is knockdown found it so it does have a critical effect you use your you still do the crit damage ability score instead of uh strength now i gotta look up knockdown uh key ability score for a and triple the spell slot level instead of the item level so it's a d20 plus your key ability score plus three times the spell slot level this is what i'm seeing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Yep.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:57]** Okay, so my key ability score is charisma, which is a plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:01]** So that would be... That's for the breach weapon special property.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** So I think the knockdown critical hit effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:08]** It is a breach weapon, though, because the adamantine shot makes it a breach weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Right?

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Right.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** But I'm wondering if the knockdown is the critical hit effect.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** Otherwise, as a breach weapon, I think you can use it to literally breach a door.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Knockdown is just the target gets knocked prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, I think you just get knocked down.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** And then it's double damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** I think it's double damage.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** I'll give you double damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** And then you get back up again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** All right.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Is this a real spell?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** I'm never going to keep it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Never to keep me down.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** What book is it out of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Adamantine Chopper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Adamantine Chopper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Yeah, but what book is it out of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** School Transmutation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** Galactic Magic is the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** There it is.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** There aren't as many Starfinder third-party books that do spells like in Pathfinder.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:47]** So do I double the first roll, or do I roll it twice?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** You roll it twice.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** You roll it twice, and you add the effects both times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** You get the bonuses.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:57]** Okay, so 13 points of damage on the first adamantine shot.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** What did you roll?

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** I rolled a five and an eight.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** A five and an eight.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Okay, that's just the first shot.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Shot number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** A 14 for KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Does not hit.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Yes.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** Does not hit.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** 17 does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Go ahead and roll that damage.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Let's get it.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Let's get it.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Eight.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Dang.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Yes, dude.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** I love this.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:40]** She's coming at you, and you just kind of pull this bullet out of your robe and flick it, and it shoots up in the air, turns into three different rounds of adamantine, and goes shooting off in her direction.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** One of them whizzes right past her head.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** The other one catches her lip and almost tears her cheek off.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:49]** And the last one hits her dead in the chest.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Amazing.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** And knocks her to the ground.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** And everybody feels a ground shake.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:04]** Even all the Kestis and the goblins that are fighting in the background, they pause for half a second and look over to see that happen.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** And the Kestis, they look nervous.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** I mean, their big boss just went down.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Amazing.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** And that's the end of your turn.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Chuck, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Get out of there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Get out of there.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Don't be a hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Be a hero.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** I'm going to make a wisdom check.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** About whether you should be a hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:26]** This is whether Chuck's going to run away or whether Chuck's going to try to stab her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** No, Chuck.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:32]** Ten or under, you stab her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Oh, my God.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** If you fail, you stab.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** You get a plus four to melee attacks, right?

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Yeah, because she's prone.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** When they're prone, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:46]** Yeah, he rolled a three on wisdom.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** He stabbed her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:54]** I love leaving character decisions up to dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** I'm so glad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Cool.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** He's going to stab her and he's going to take the full attack to stab her.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Yes.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:02]** He's going to try to stab her twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Let me just double check prone.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:07]** What is... Are you close enough to do a full attack, Matt?

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Yeah.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** I'm within five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** It's pretty bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Okay.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** So he has the L fan.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:19]** So if he was just a tiny creature, he would have zero reach.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:26]** But because he has the extending arm tentacle things, he's able to do a regular five-foot reach like normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:33]** And the prone is that a Sashla will have a minus four penalty against Chok's melee attacks.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** It's not that Chok has a plus four.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Yeah.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Okay.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** I was just reading that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** That's what I meant.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** It's the same thing, though.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** It's effectively the same thing, but it's technically.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** It's like subtracting the negatives.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** It's still addition.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Cool.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** But I was also trying to look up how to get back up.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** That's a move action to stand up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Yeah, it's a move action.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** Okay.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Chalk, what do you do?

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:58]** So for a full round attack, it's minus two to each attack.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Is that it?

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Minus four.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Minus four.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** So you're breaking even, essentially.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Because she has a minus four to her AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** So that's a 13 for the first stab.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** That's a miss.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** That's a miss.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:15]** Chex tries to stab her, but it glances off one of her scales.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Even with the minus four?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Yeah, well, I only get a plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:25]** It's a minus four from his attack, but it's also a minus four to her AC, so it's equivalent, equaling out.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** So whatever he tells me is going to be, like, he's fighting her basic AC.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Right?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** You're not subtracting that minus four, right?

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Correct.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Fifteen.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Fifteen also does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** What easy to hit monster were you talking about just a minute ago?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Come on, dude.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Easier than a 27.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** Talk about unrealistic expectations.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Sorry if I misled you on that one.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** So misleading.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I think that was on purpose.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** This was a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** This was a trap.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** I told you it might be a trap.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** We all fell for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Choc's dying.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** That's fine.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** He's like Choc's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Kevin's the abracadabra Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** Sashla is going to stand up from prone.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** How dare she.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Cool.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** The audacity.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Cool, cool.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** And Chuck is the only one.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** It's just like he's the shadow of a sendover shot.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** It's a good day.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Sorry.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** He just looks up slowly.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** As she stands up, Chuck sees his entire political career that he left behind.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** Flash before his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** That's a 20 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** I don't know who you think you're attacking, but yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** No.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** But it's only 8 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Only enough to put somebody down.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** I rolled a 1 on that.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** You only need one.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** You only need one hit point, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Oh, you're still up.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:05]** I have one hit point.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:10]** Her claw comes down and she slices right between you.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** You're just standing in between her.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:18]** You come up between her fingers but all your leaves and your arms are just shredded.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** But you're still alive.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:25]** You're just like, oh, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** You see a little sap run down his leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:33]** It's now Bomb Guzzle's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** That one is mine!

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:43]** Because he's pissed at you for not only killing his god, but also teasing him a little.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** He didn't like that.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:52]** But he wants you to himself, and so he's going to take another shot at Asashla.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** That's a 21 to hit, and that hits.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** I lost mine.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** I found it.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** I found the right guy.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:13]** That is max damage for, big math, 11 points of damage on Asashila.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Good.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** She's got to be getting there soon, hopefully.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Impressive.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** Yeah, very nice.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:25]** He looks you, and he's so pissed at you, but he's like, I want you for myself.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:29]** And he shoots Asashila one more time, and it hits her dead in the shoulder.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** She's wrecked after just standing up.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** It's now Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Oh, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:41]** Thaddeus, like, actually catches himself being kind of sad about the shack situation.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** And then he kind of, like, you know, in spite of the fact that he's also kind of pissed off.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:50]** And he also wants to, like, give him his just due soon for all that shenanigans.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** But he tells, like, that Torme is like, Torme, it's up to you.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:58]** But if you could lift him out of there, I know you could do things like that.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** That might be helpful.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** I'm not sure how much he weighs.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** And then... Terme, what's your health at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** Uh... I say telepathically, I'm fine.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I'm full health.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:16]** And Shaq didn't do any critical s*** recently, right?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Nope.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Never mind.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Then he's just gonna, like, shoot him.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** Dude, with technical formula, it doesn't hit.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** You can tell me.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** No, no, no.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** It's nothing secret.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:30]** I was just going to top you up because I can do that if you did a critical action, which you don't need it.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** No, we should save it for chalk, baby.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:33]** Yeah.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Wait, what is a critical action?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** I'm confused.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Basically, Will did some crit s***.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:42]** So then, like, I can ask Thaddeus once a day.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Or actually, I don't even think it's once a day.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** Just generally, whenever a crit thing happens, he's like, Regroup!

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Like he did earlier with Rolu.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** And help him heal up a little bit.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Do I get a spell slot for that?

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** No, it's some kind of passive action thing.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Can you remind me and the listeners what that is?

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:13]** uh it's called regroup and um it is a two state hold on this triggering the triggering ally regains stamina points equal to your class level plus your charisma bonus and so on oh nice you can use it indefinitely you can use it over and over and over

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:36]** but it's after someone performs some kind of critical thing you know what i mean okay during a combat though it's like during that combat exactly it's like limited limited victor cries effect only the ally that scored a critical hit or reduce or reduce an enemy to zero hit points so that's basically so i could almost tank at least once right it replenishes me once this is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** This is in the Core Rulebook, right?

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** I don't know why it's not popping up for me.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** It's a feat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:50]** You can... I don't know if it has to be done in the same round, basically, or immediately after you perform the critical hit.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** I don't know.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** What's the feat?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** It's called Victory Cry.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:00]** Specifically... Specifically Regroup.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** And I'm not sure if I can just use it later on in combat.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** If that's the case, then that would be very helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:22]** battle leader so it's part of your battle leader skills which is your theme right yeah okay sorry yeah you learn one victory cry chosen from the list below as a reaction when you or an ally scores a critical hit against a significant enemy within time yeah cool okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** But I wonder when I can use it.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:30]** You'd have to use it as a reaction when we'll create the Xanadu out of 18 shot.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** So pretty much immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** I would give it to you at the end of that turn.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** That makes sense to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I think so, too.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** But it doesn't need to be done.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** You can use it.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Actually, it's f***ing free.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** F*** it.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Do you need health, Will?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Sorry, this is going on for a while.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** I have full health.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** He's just going to shout regroup, and he's going to be like, well done, regroup.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** And then he shoots, and he misses.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** Wait, what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** How do you know you missed?

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** It was like an 11, dude.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Oh, yeah, you missed.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** But you should tell me.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** I want to know.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Well, I just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** I missed.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Unfortunately, Will do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** All right.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Moving on.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** That was Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** It is back to the top with round number three.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Rolu, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** Okay, Rolu's going to do something that I've never done before, because you know what?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** We're...

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** You only live life once.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** I, and this is a total rules question for you, Kev.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:32]** I want to reposition chalk or bull rush or essentially grab and move chalk out of the way.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:43]** That is a reposition combat maneuver says that as a full action, you can move and drag the target along behind you for every five.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:49]** Like as much as you move them, you, you can also move, but maybe it's different because Jack is willing.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Benny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:55]** Um, I think it's also worth noting that one check is willing and two check is tiny fair.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** And these rules are assuming you're trying to move a medium creature, a medium unwilling creature.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** So automatic success.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:06]** And I would probably ask if it's possible to do that and also move through threatened square with acrobatics.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Maybe that's too much tumble tumble.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:19]** Uh, you can definitely try that, but just remember for every time you pass through one threatened square, the second time you try to tumble, um, would be a plus two to the DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Got it.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** So it would be two movements, though, to go in and out, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Yeah, I could either.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:34]** So for the listener, you know, Termay and I are about 20 feet apart, and Chalk is right in the middle of us and also 10 feet, like, south of us.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** So, like, diagonally down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** It's like a little triangle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:47]** Yeah, so I could duck in and then come back up, or I could keep going and go past Bomb Guzzle because I don't know that Bomb Guzzle is really attacking us.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** You know, I could try and make it to the far side.

**[00:48:50 - 00:49:10]** of bomb gozzle this is a tough thing we're literally running in between like in the open field in front of this literal riveter demon chalk is at the tip of the spear between two armies yes all right so i'm gonna so so just to be clear i'm gonna try and reposition him

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:34]** i'm rolling to see if i can move uh i'll show you kev take like five feet i'm not i'll move roller back but i'm moving five feet grabbing chalk and then moving five feet away does that make sense you can't move action move but that's part of the reposition oh then is it then i guess i could move here and reposition chalk next to tournament five feet away okay

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** Well, no, five feet reposition is move five feet.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** If you do a full action, you move them some more.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** So really, uh, is this square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Oh, you can move them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Yeah.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Is this square between Treme and I?

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:53]** So it's about 10 feet away from that is still within a Sasha's reach.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Ah,

**[00:49:53 - 00:50:08]** so really this doesn't make any sense unless you can go really high in your case you can beat his kac by an extra five but it doesn't make sense instead i should try and boost chalk and let chalk try and get out of there because i think chalk takes their turn before this ribboner

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** but then chalk also.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** All right.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** All right.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** So you're saying I can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Uh, you can, I don't know.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** I just don't know how useful it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** Uh, you can't move action, move in with, uh, with the action that you're trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** So yes, I can only move here, but nowhere.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** So, and by here, I mean like within reach.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:38]** So I would just tumble or I would try and tumble, get it without incurring an AOL, but nowhere that I move chalk is going to be safe from the river.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** No,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:44]** Not if you can only move... That's if you can move in the first place, because it's KSE plus 8.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:50]** And then the only way to move him out of the danger would be... Oh, and that's a very curious question.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** If you move a body with reposition, do they incur AOL?

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** I don't think I'm going to reposition, though.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:04]** Because after all this long, drawn-out thing, there's nowhere that Chak can be moved that doesn't have any... That's safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** All ruins lead to getting killed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:35]** pretty much uh but rolu's gonna try and pull focus from chalk uh unless or from yeah unless maybe shock has healing serums or maybe termite could float him out you know i don't know can i move and give him a healing serum or is uh there is a rule against that and we talked about this is a standard action to apply or is it a full action it's a standard to do it to yourself it's a full action to give it to somebody else


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Yeah.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Because I have healing serums, but I can't.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** I can't get out there fast enough.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** You could throw it out of there, right?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Could I throw it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:53]** If you throw it and you can score above the AC, which you probably could, I'll give him a reaction to grab it with a dex check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Okay.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Don't we have like a bajillion healing?

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** I thought Shaq had some, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Does Shaq have any?

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** I've got one.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** I'll give him one.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** All right.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** I'm going to heal his soak and you heal his hit points.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:15]** And Rolu is going to take a five-foot diagonal step forward closer to the Rivener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** You're doing a guard step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** Yeah.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Okay.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:28]** And then Rolu is going to cast Blessing of Youth on Chok to heal Chok's stamina points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** What is the distance on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** For blessings of use, I think it's 30... The range is 25, so 35 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** So you're not going to move, you're just going to cast that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:40]** Right, because if I move, then cast, I'll incur an AOA.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** Yeah.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Yeah.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:44]** So that is unfortunately only two stamina points.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** It's something.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:55]** Because I think Rolu is thinking and feeling the pressure of realizing that one of his team members may go down.

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:02]** And so as his hand starts moving and he's saying the words that he said over and over again, he stumbles a little bit and there's a brief flashback.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:31]** flutter in his concentration and so you don't get all of the stamina points that you could have get but Rolu then focuses his attention takes a few steps forward in a guarded step next to Chak and closer to the Rivener and is going to look up at this massive beast and say why don't you pick on someone your own size and that's Rolu's turn very brave Rolu brave and stupid I love it very Rolu-esque very Rolu-esque


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:31 - 00:54:00]** JK that was actually a smart move just kidding and now it's Treme's turn uh yeah what he said except uh don't hit me please uh I'm going to take a guarded step forward and uh administer I can't I guess I can't administer right I can only just alright it's a full action yeah that's the breaks dude that's the hard part


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** I hate that, by the way.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** I think we had this argument before, but I think it's dumb.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** You can change it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** Full action is, it says helpless or unconscious creature, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:37]** anyway um in the meantime can i do like a could i do like a skill um can i see like do a life science check or maybe perception mysticism i don't know is there anything does does keshji like have any special things i could be aware of that i could roll for you can roll a life science to learn more about the keshji sure okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** 21.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** What do you want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:48]** Uh, any, like, immunities or, like, weaknesses or, uh... I don't know.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Good idea.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** What's there to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** Well, there's no immunities or weaknesses.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Ah.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** You already know she has 10-foot reach.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Uh...

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Yeah, she's pretty simple.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:03]** She is just a war machine that can smash you up.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:08]** I will tell you she has a claw that does plus 8 to attack.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** It does 1d6 damage plus 7 for slashing damage.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** That's about it.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** That's all she's got going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:33]** no like cool okay so she's not immune okay did i do that skill check for free or is that uh is that all yeah i'll give you that free all right uh i want to cast a uh stumble which is a cantrip

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:46]** As a standard action, then I momentarily transpose the position of the limbs of the target in order to move or interfere with its proprioception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Proprioception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:55]** If the target fails its reflex save, it's off target and can move only half speed for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Nice.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Nice.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** I hope this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** What do I save against?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** It's a reflex save.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** DC 13.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** It's not that great.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:29]** pass that oh okay i got a 19 on the die never work stumble good try good try it's it's a cantrip next next turn i'll i'll hit chalk so that was your whole turn yeah if chalk goes down uh i can revive chalk and i can administer the serum yeah same if need be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:50]** interesting because it's now chalk's turn what are you gonna do chalk three points away from death and i'm actually curious uh you don't have to answer this if you don't want to is it mathematically possible for her to do 15 damage crit uh yeah just create i think because i told you it's one 1d6 plus 7 so max damage from her is 13 okay cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** where your math is going with that.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** It's kind of scaring me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Just running some numbers in my head.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** And this is a threatened square.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** The square above me is threatened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** You are in a threatened square and the square above you is threatened.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:08]** Don't forget, you can also try tumble or you can just do guarded steps.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Those are options.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Can you do two garden steps in a single run?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Talk to me about tumbling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:23]** So tumbling is an acrobatics check against their I think it's 15 plus one and a half times her CR.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** So I have that value up and ready.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** You can roll an acrobatics check against that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:35]** If I fail the acro check, then I take the attack of opportunity or I don't move.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:39]** You take the attack of opportunity, and then I think you continue to move.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** It's probably safer to just do guard steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Yeah, just do two guard steps.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Could you do two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** I mean, you can tumble if you want.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** I'm all for it.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** Nobody tumbles around here.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** That's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Let's look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** My son does it all the time.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** He tumbles and avoids my attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Okay.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** Vinny's living by the dice.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** I'm going to die by the dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:05]** Okay, so it is... Let's see, you move... Tumbling is a move action, and you move at half your speed.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** That's the only thing to know.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:17]** You move through... To move through a threatened area is 15 plus one and a half times the opponent's CR, and then it increases by two every additional threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** It's just one threatened square you have to get through, right?

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Right.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:23]** If he's moving through a threatened square, but he's still moving out of a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Yeah, he's moving into one and then out of one.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** So it's twice?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** I'm going to say that's twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** That's risky, dude.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** It's two rolls.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Nope, that's too risky.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** I'm going to double guard this stuff.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** Good job.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** There it is.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:46]** I wanted to try to take advantage of the extra five feet of movement that John gave me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:57]** I mean, to be fair, like, I mean, you still get your movement after you tumble is the advantage, right?

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:07]** So you can tumble for two squares at five feet, so it would be ten feet, and then you have 20 feet of the rest of your movement, right, Kev?

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** But I would also have 25 feet after that.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** If you have 30 feet.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Because of the blessings of youth.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Where am I going to go?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** I'm going to go right here.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** That's a double move.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:26]** Jack is out of the way of danger.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:31]** He's retreated next to Wepps on the very back line of the battle.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** Near the entrance to the... Yes.

**[00:59:35 - 01:00:00]** as far away from danger as possible at the west position yeah glad you could see actually slightly farther away from danger than than the plant is that's true that's very true still it's gonna throw that out there arranged warrior yeah all right all right cool crisis averted wow cool stuff jack might die today


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** All right.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** So it is now Asashla's turn.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Wait, why is there another aura?

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Who did that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** I did.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Stop it.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Turn it off.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** I did.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** What is going on?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** There are no auras anywhere.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** I have to refresh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** So it is Asashla's turn.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:17]** She is going to be attacking somebody.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** There's only two of you within her reach.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:23]** I think she's actually going to do a full attack.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:28]** So that is a minus four.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Goodbye, world.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** Does a 14 hit?

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Roll it.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:35]** Casey?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** No.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:41]** Get out of here with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]** So she does her right hand, swings down at that.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Her left hand kick rocks.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** The natural one.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** This is so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Pull out the deck.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Let's do it.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** Man, you guys are lucky.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:07]** I was thinking about just taking out a little goblin in the back just to save you a turn, but I didn't.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** I went for it only to get a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** These are the best moments is when you just go for it.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Ready?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Here we go.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Stop it.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** It's a kinetic attack, right?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Kinetic?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Yes.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** Apply just a flesh wound.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** That's the name.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Good, good.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:42]** Apply the wound critical hit effect to yourself, and you roll on table 7-1, core rulebook, page 183, and suffer the listed effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** Oh, we've seen this before.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** This is metal.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** This table is absolutely metal.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** I'm so excited for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** Page 183.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Fortitude negates.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Fortitude negates.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** Let's see what you're going to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** So, like, you could lose an arm.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** That'd be fun.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:06]** You could lose a leg.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Okay.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** This is a fortitude negates, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:14]** Yeah, which is tough because then I have to go figure out what the DC is for your fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** It's a pretty high fort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** I think I passed.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** It's an 18 on the die for a total of 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** What's the attacker's CR?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:23]** I'm sorry.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** The DC is, hold on.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]** It's 10 plus one half the attacker's CR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** One half the attacker's CR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:32]** Yeah.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:52]** or is it one in one so for ability checks it's 10 plus one half the attacker cr for a skill check it's 15 plus one and one half i think fortitude is an ability check right because it's based on your constitution it's based on my cr yes the attacker's cr the attacker's cr


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** Okay, so it should be 11 then.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** And you pass.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** And then I passed, for sure.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:57]** Okay, that's it.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** 27.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Yeah.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** So nothing happens?

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** So much for that card.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** Yeah, the wound critical hit effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** It's unfortunate.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** Lame.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Wow.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Lame.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Lame is critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:21]** So she misses one, and she stumbles on the other, and then coming from behind, one goblin runs up to her and jumps on her shoulders and starts...

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:32]** Like stabbing her with his dog slicer, and she just grabs him from over the back of her neck and slams him on the ground by the scruff of his neck.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:40]** You just hear all of his bones crack as he hits the ground right in front of you, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Oh!

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** No!

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** Come on.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** I want to keep going.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** I just wanted this to end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** I think we're close.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** I think we're getting there.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** For sure.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** We've already done like 35 damage or something.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Yeah, we've done a lot of damage.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Something kind of high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** Well, it's done a lot of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:02]** Shock, thankfully, is safe.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** Kev just left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** I'm just going to say, for the final page of this episode... Everyone, talk about Kev.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Kev just took off.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Kev just took off.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Yeah.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** He was like, I'm out of here.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** Forget this.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:12]** Yeah.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:15]** He's like, dude, I'm not going to give you all any more money.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Let's talk about Kev in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:21]** He's not going to give us any info on what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Or any explanation.
