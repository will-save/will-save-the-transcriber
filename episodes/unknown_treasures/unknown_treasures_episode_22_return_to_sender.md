**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to another episode of We'll Save at the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin, your GM, and this is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** Beep, beep, beep, beep.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:28]** welcome back happy real estate wednesday or whatever day it is for you let's just jump into this one real fast like you're jumping into a pool of ice so this this actually leads to ice ice i'm not sure where your vinnie is gonna go with this one uh but for me

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:32]** An absolute faux pas is putting milk, putting ice in milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** It is disgusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** Right?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:39]** It's a weird constant.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:46]** Actually, my dad, bless his heart, he won't listen to this podcast, still puts ice in his wine.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:54]** I bought him the gel wine glasses so that he can freeze those and put his wine in so he doesn't have to drink like a Neanderthal.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Anyway,

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:03]** No, this is a debate that my wife and I have fairly often because she will not drink anything with ice in it at all.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:09]** She has to have no ice water, no ice soda, no ice, just no ice in anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** I don't drink water with ice in it.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** I like my water kind of room temperature.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Do you drink Dr. Pepper with ice?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** No, Dr. Pepper needs to be cold.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** But with ice.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** But that's what the ice is for.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** So ice in my Dr. Pepper?

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Yes, I'm for that.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Okay.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** But like ice in beer?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Oh, yeah, no.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Oh, well, who's doing that?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** Well, the Brits would do that because there's no, like, cold beer sometimes.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** Yeah.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** In a weird way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** Because Lucas makes their... No, they just drink warm beer.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Well, allegedly.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** That's a big dig in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** Well, John could confirm because he was recently in the UK.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** There was no ice in any beer.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Yeah, they don't... Was the beer cold?

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:48]** It was cold.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Yeah.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Okay, that's good.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** No.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Like, America cold or, like, Britain cold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** All right, all right.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** It was America cold.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:18]** i have had it be british variable before i just heard that i think he said like erica cold and i was like what wait who's this erica why oh this girl john and i used to know you don't want to know have you ever seen the videos about like europeans versus americans and how like europeans think it's weird that americans boil water in the microwave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Who does that?

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Do you boil water in a microwave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** I think this might be a Kevin thing.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** People who do, I don't personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:36]** I don't boil my water, but if I'm just going to make some tea and I'm just going to put it in my mug and put the mug in the microwave.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** And that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** Why have electric kettles not caught on in the U.S.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** ?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** I have them.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** I have them.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Because they're overseas everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Right.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** It's brilliant.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** I have a regular kettle, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:53]** I mean, I'm not quite that bougie, but I've got the electric kettle.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** I have every sort of kettle you can imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:00]** I will point out that I do boil my water for coffee on the stove.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Or not boil, but heat it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** What?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** If you're with a French press.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** Hang on.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Kev, how do you make your coffee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Yeah, this is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Well, I use electric kettle for that.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** That makes sense.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:14]** All right.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Again, electric kettle.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** It's perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Look it up.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** Okay, but do you do pour over or do you do French?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** You said French press.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** French press, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** This is great.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** I prefer to buy it from somewhere.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** What is the problem with being like water in a microwave?

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** I need it to be hot so I can put it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** All the microwave is.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** This is just science.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** A microwave just vibrates the water.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:46]** It vibrates the molecules at the frequency that makes it create heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** It's very hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:51]** Technically speaking, with tea, it should be boiling even for lighter teas.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** No.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Not always.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** It should be just shy of boiling, I thought.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** It depends on the tea.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** Alright, fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** I do 170 degrees.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Let's bring this full circle.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Do you put ice in your coffee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** This is a fun one, Vinny.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** You might like this, but I'll let everybody go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:16]** I will never, ever again make a hot coffee and then put ice in it and call it iced coffee.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** I just will not.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** I'm just not going to do that.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** You're doing it wrong.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** It's wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** It doesn't taste right.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:25]** It's weird.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** There's a difference between iced coffee and cold brew.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** They're not the same.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** There's a difference between Americano and brewed coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:40]** There is a way to do a hot... I forget who does it, but there's like a...

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:46]** I think it's actually a Japanese method of cooling it and then putting ice in it.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:50]** Through some sort of aeration, I've seen.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** I'm curious about this.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Rumors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Japanese only.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Myths?

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I got two things.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** So one, there's our farmer's market around here.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** There's a company called Zeek's that comes out.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:10]** They have a truck there and they do a nitro cold brew, which is delicious until it is no longer nitroed.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** Then it becomes just regular bitter cold brew and it needs some cream and sugar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Because it oxidizes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Yeah.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Yeah.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** So the nitro cold brew is delicious at first.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:28]** And the second thing is, I recommend trying it before you start making fun of me for it, is I like to order a nice hot coffee with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Affogato.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:38]** Dude, I tried this for the first time on Thursday night, and it was spectacular.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** I had zero expectations.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** It was so good.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** Did you try it because I mentioned it once before?

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** Or do you try it on your own?

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Try it on my own.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Cool.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** I'm just like, oh, there's hot coffee.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** There's ice cream over there.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** Let me get a scoop.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** It's awesome.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** I'll put it in my cup.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** It's so awesome.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** It's spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** It cools the coffee coming out at just the right rate, and it gives it a little bit of vanilla.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** The ice cream doesn't melt right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:04]** It's like eating a fried ice cream, but with a pick-me-up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** It's so good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Yeah.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:06]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:10]** The funny thing is if you ask for it at a coffee shop, they're very confused.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** They're like, I don't know.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** How many coffee shops have ice cream?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Few, but I've been to a couple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** They're not going to carry it.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:20]** This might be the first food item that you and I have wholeheartedly agreed on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** I have good taste sometimes.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, Kevin, that's an outlier and a really good thing you just said, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** A broken clock is right twice a day, Kev.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** That's right.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** So, you know, it's good.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** You found one of my times around the clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** Speaking of clocks, what time are we at, Kev?

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** We should play.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** We should play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** I forgot to start the timer again because I'm absolutely terrible at this.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** By the time we get to the end of this game, I'll finally figure out how to start a timer on time.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** But no, I think we're good.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** I tried.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** You should set a timer to start your timer, dude.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Here we go.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** We're in that sweet spot for banter time.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** I think we're good.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:01]** All right, so last week, we found you back at the Thaster Toad hole.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:12]** You used your... Sorry, you, being Treme, used your psychokinetic hand to lift a container out of the hole without confronting the injured Toad that was down there.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:20]** Thaddeus asked Treme to help him decipher Rolu's messages, and Rolu talked to... Oh, I'm sorry.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Yeah, Rolu's messages.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** And Rolu talked to Vahri about the Stellar Flare.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:29]** You guys moved on in search of the Stellar Flare, but you found yourself stuck in the middle of a minefield!

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:45]** Under the wreckage of Vaskarian Cruiser lie these plasma torpedoes, kind of buried in the mud and dirt, and you make yourself, you guys, major way across this minefield, only triggering two of the torpedoes along the way.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** You're now at this makeshift shack on the other end.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:54]** Treme sees a data pad under the pillow and a container under the bed, and I misheard Will

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:02]** So Treme pulled his second connected hand on the wrong thing and lifted up the data pad, not the container.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** Because I heard container.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** I heard container, but my brain didn't listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** You heard what you wanted to hear.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Right, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** I heard data pad, so I went with data pad.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:13]** So retconning that, you're moving the data pad.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** What happens?

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Any questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** I was going to say that we could have, well, I'll say it later.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** Okay.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** All right.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** You sure you don't want to say it now?

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** I was just going to say that we could have used a junk drone, and I totally forgot.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:30]** I just need to remember that we have stuff, and we picked up stuff.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:35]** That is, took that rifle, we had the junk drone, now we have this mindless circlet.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** Drunk drone.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** We have a drunk drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** All right, well, let's take you back to the map.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** I'm pretty sure you're already there.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** No?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Are you there yet?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Yeah, we're there.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** We never left.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** On the map, you guys made it across this torpedo field.

**[00:09:51 - 00:10:00]** Will's smartest thing I've ever seen Will do marked X's along the path that you guys went and therefore you guys could just walk across.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Honestly, I was like, what the hell is he doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** And then I was like, oh, wait.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:08]** All of the things that Will has done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** He's done many smart things.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Apparently not as smart as this.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:17]** Will, who manages our website, this is the smartest thing we've seen him do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Yeah, this is definitely it.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** I mean, we still don't have our HTTPS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:28]** Incredibly successful at what he does, but he really should stick to minefields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** Minefields and Snapchat filters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** Speaking of, go get your Snapchat filter of the WillSafe hats.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** WillSafe!

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** So the minefield is off to kind of to the like three quarters of the page on the right.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** On the left hand side, there's a makeshift tent.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** Thaddeus is down on the very south side of the map next to the tent.

**[00:10:48 - 00:11:01]** And the rest of you are up on the north side, kind of clustered together real tight around Treme, where he lifts up the data pad with his psychokinetic hand and the pillow falls over.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** And the Psychokinetican carries the datapad to him.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** And that's it.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** And that's our game.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** And that's our game.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** We all explode.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** I'm working on making suspenseful endings.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** That was it.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** That's why I said datapad.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** I was so focused on how am I going to end this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** But didn't he grab the crate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** It's cool.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** No problem.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Nothing blew up.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** But now what are you going to do?

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** You have a datapad.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Yeah, change the music.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Don't worry.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** There's plenty of chances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:38]** So I'm not really trained in computers, so this is a data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** I guess I can access it, right?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** Because I have some sort of basic ability, but I'm sure it's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** I'll say two things about it.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** One, you can give me an engineering check.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** That might give you some information.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** A computer's check is definitely going to be required to unlock it.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:58]** And then also the crate is a steel lock box with a lock on it.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** The lock...

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** It's pretty simple, but it'll still take an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** I will pass the data pad off to Chuck.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** Yeah.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:14]** And I'm going to go after the crate.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:18]** I'm happy to aid you on that engineering check.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** It looks a little complex.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** I thought it was computer to me.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** No, computers is for the data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** I don't know how to do Roller's voice, so I'm just going to do Yogi Bear.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Hey, y'all, look at this lock here.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** It looks kind of complicated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:55]** And then and then like I guess like shot a little like sidekick This look looks pretty simple All right

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** What does Ranger Rick sound like?

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** Oh my god, Vinny, he looks like a supervillain everyone at home, like the way that he's frozen right now.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** It's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** I think it's the internet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** It's important to have good internet.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** His mother-in-law tripped over the internet.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Vinny, roll the check to get your internet back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** Got him.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Do I stop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** I can pause the timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** Oh, he's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** Goodbye, Vinny.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** This is a strange...

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** This is a strange place.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** And we're back.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** And we're back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** I passed the, uh, yeah, thing.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** Yeah.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** We're going to open up this lock and I'm going to roll to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Cool.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Okay.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** Give me, uh, engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** 18.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** Plus, I guess, roll who's assisting, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Plus two is 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** With the assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** It's just enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** You crack open the box.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** And the lockbox contains... This is a lot, dude.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** You guys want to write this down?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I'm excited for you.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:07]** There is a spell gem of junk armor.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** Of what?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Junk armor.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** There's also a spell gem of junk barricade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** This is delightful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** And a spell gem of junk restraints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:28]** You're like a senior citizen woman, like, reading off bingo numbers right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** That's what you sound like.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** B7JB22.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** It's got to be like one through eight.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** I have no idea how big it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** It's amazing.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** Somebody's I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:42 - 00:15:06]** cool uh so that's all the stuff that's in the box that's all you get a bunch of junk gems useless wait so the first there's two junk gems or there's just three one of junk armor one of junk barricade and one of junk restraints cool i'm gonna assign somebody some homework so we can get some story time starfinder story time next week just read them what they do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** No, I don't want to read them.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** I do enough reading in this game.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Next week, we'll do Starfinder Storytime on junk.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Sorry, not junk stuff, but on spell gems.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Yay.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** I'll sign that to Kelly.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** Kelly, I want you to do all the research you can on spell gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Oh, yes.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** I'm so excited.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** I will take a note of that right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** All of it.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** All the information.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Every last bit of it.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** Okay, so... Moving on.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** Okay, hold on.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Well, the items are written down by Jon.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** You should play Bingo on Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** So, Spellgems... It doesn't matter what spell is in the gym.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** I want to know more about Spellgems themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Well, I know about those already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Oh, then go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** But I'll tell them next time, though, I guess.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Nope.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Trigger the Starfinder story time.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Let's do this.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Save it for next time.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:52]** All right, cue the children that we totally did not kidnap to say what they said.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** All right, so basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Wait, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** You got a little more.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** I need this drop, by the way.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** Okay, so I guess we're going to... Thank you, John.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Hey, guys.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:23]** So spell gems are magical items constructed of a lattice of rare metals on shards of precious stone enclosed in a silicon casing, each imbued with the energy of a particular spell.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:31]** A spellcasting character can use a spell gem to cast a spell within the item without using up any of their daily spell slots, which is awesome.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** The spell gem becomes inert and useless after this usage.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:40]** The spellcaster doesn't need to know the spell within the gem, but it does need to be on the list of possible spells they could learn.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:48]** For instance, only a technomancer can use a spell gem of junk armor, which is what we have in this case, or one of the ones that we have.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:52]** So the spellcaster must also have a high enough key ability score to cast a spell.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:58]** For instance, a technomancer must have an intelligence score of 13 or higher to use a spell gem with a third level spell in it.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:16]** Finally, casting the spell from the gem takes the same number of actions as casting it normally, but if the item level of the spell gem is higher than the character's caster level, they must succeed at a caster level check by rolling a 1d20 plus their caster level with a dc equal to the spell gem's item level plus 1.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** A spell gem with a second level spell has an item level of 5.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:24]** On a failure, the spell isn't cast, but the spell gem isn't destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** That was beautiful.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Fun fact.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** All the spells are Technomancer spells.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** And we don't have a Technomancer in the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, we don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** So, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Thanks, Kevin.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:43]** But maybe we'll get lucky.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** Maybe we'll find a Technomancer NPC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:50]** What's up, Kevin?

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:55]** Let's just restart this whole campaign and I'll tell you exactly what the book has written out for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:00]** We should have had a Technomancer on this junk adventure is what you're telling us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:04]** I mean, there is a class that I offered for you guys called a Junkmancer.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Oh, my God.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** For real, though?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** For real, though.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** It's a real thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:09]** My goodness.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** She's like a junk bender.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Among other things.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:19]** Maybe we can find a Junkmancer gauntlet that lets some plebeian...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:40]** dang yeah no let me search that in the pdf to see if that's in the book somewhere you know you could just add it yeah because every time i add something it goes really well all right so what happens in the data pad oh yeah i guess i should there's data pad does anybody else want to roll perception

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Sure.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** Tremé is very focused on the box and the data pad.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** 20.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** Okay.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** Perfect.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** This box has got stuff I can't even use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:03]** So what you're realizing is that this makeshift tent is from somebody who's very, and I'm just at a loss for words, good at being in the wilderness.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** What's the term for that?

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** He's a survivalist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** He's a survivalist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Yes, that's the term.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:12]** I was trying to avoid the word survival because we used that for checks, but yes, he's a survivalist.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** He's very MacGyver style.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** He's Bear Grylls, but without the camera crew?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** He's MacGyver.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:42]** right but a little more army related more more militaristic uh because in the corner of this this area next to the bed you actually see a rubbish cannon a light rubber rubbish cannon and there is a golem forged plating type 2 hanging next to the bed what's that yeah what is that plating


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** I will take that if I can.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Sounds like heavy armor.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Heavy armor.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** It's heavy armor?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** I can use heavy armor.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** Golem forged plating too.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** I'll take it then, I guess.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:04]** Golem forged plating is one of the most popular heavy armors in the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:10]** It is... So... What type of weapon is this?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Junk weapon.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** That's rude.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Why are you calling it a junk weapon?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Is it one-handed or two?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** What is junk?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:21]** That's what the freaking heading next to this thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** Okay, it is a junk weapon, I guess.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** It's a junk weapon.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** It's a level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Junkers delight.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** Junk isn't a derogatory word.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:40]** Instead of rockets or other mass-produced ammunition, a rubbish cannon is loaded with one bulk of junk.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** It is a junk cannon.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** I think it's a heavy weapon.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** It says light.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** It says light, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I'm trying to figure out if...

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:12]** if check can wield it or not 1d8 bludgeoning that's okay yeah that's better than my pistol yeah right it's got knockdown on critical which is kind of cool it is also as far as like it is a two-handed heavy weapon cool wow per the book well i can't wield it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** I think that's dumb.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Who can will it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** That is the whip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Are you proficient in heavy weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:28]** I have... Yeah, I am proficient in them, but I don't know if I want it.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** The weapons officer can't use a weapon.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** I can use that, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** It's like unlimited ammo out here because you just load it with junk.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** But I don't know if that's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** So I'm just going to check my formium venom caster real quick.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** So, and it, wow.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:47]** I'll take it for now.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Yeah, I'll figure it out.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** I can maybe like pass another weapon to someone else in exchange.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Cool.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** All right.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:58]** So all that's left is this data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** So somebody give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Engineering or computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Somebody give me engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** I'll assist.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** I don't have engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** I don't have it.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** I got a 23.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Perfect.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:16]** You can tell that it's a common model of electronics produced and used by the Vascarium.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:23]** The data pad is a tier one computer with miniaturized upgrade, and it's locked with a passcode.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:27]** Which, guess what it takes to break a passcode?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** Kelly?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** You having any ideas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** No, I have something for later.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Please continue.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** I'm not trained in this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Thank you.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** I'm also not trained in computers.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Except in real life.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Want to guess a computer's check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Yep.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** So you already handed it off to Chuck, right?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** Because he said he could handle computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Am I the only one that knows how to use this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** I know there's a keyboard somewhere and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Check rolls his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Do you use a stylus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** I prefer paint and oil.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** This is like a Newton, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** You people are useless.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** A yeoman whose entire life relies on Excel spreadsheets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I keep it all in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:35]** smart smart if you're a yeoman and you're listening and you use more than excel spreadsheets please tell us everything you use it's a nine oh yeah all right that doesn't work or all the three on the die cool well moving on then i guess unless do you want to take you could do what take 20 oh yeah i think you can as long as there's not a um negative outcome negative consequence you can try

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Let's see.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** So you're saying if there's a trap, you can't take 20?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** So does that mean it's up to me to let you take 20 or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I think that's by definition, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** All right, go ahead and take 20.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Kelly, what do you got going on?

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** You're the GM.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** You get to decide everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:51]** So Thaddeus realizes that after that...

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** He realizes that when the torpedo went off that it actually didn't hit him.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** It hit his breakaway Aegis, which took all the damage for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** That's what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** It was equipped, Kevin.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** I just literally forgot that it was equipped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** I need you to tell me ahead of time.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** You need to keep this in mind.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** No, Kevin, that doesn't make sense.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** I'm going to say no to that one.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** It's still good for next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** The torpedo somehow just went around his breakaway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:20]** How did it go through my... Did we repair your breakaway Aegis, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:41]** i prepared it after every every engagement we've had i've always like rebuilt it so well it takes 10 minutes to do so yeah of course i i need you to let me know that you have it at the time otherwise but like why would i need to you should just assume that i like have it on because i always because i can't remember everything it's up to you to remember well i'm informed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** We'll argue about this later.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** I don't know.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** It seems like the easiest thing to retcon because it's literally the rules.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** But if you don't like the rules, man, then I guess I could take back.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** I'll gladly take a vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** There are five people here.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:58]** So everybody raise your hand if you want Thaddeus to use his breakaway ages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** Are you serious, you two?

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Are you serious, Vinny and John?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** I think you have to call it in the moment.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:15]** I don't agree at all, but I'll just... It wasn't just a GM call at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** I think it's funny.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Kelly and Will, have you guys GMed yet?

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Anything?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Anything ever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Yeah.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Okay, then never mind.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:30]** I was going to say we were split by everyone who's GM'd and everyone who hasn't, but that's no longer true.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** I want to give it to you.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:37]** Here's how I would have expected it as a GM.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Bomb goes off.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Kelly says, cool.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** As it explodes, so does my armor.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** And I only lose X, Y, Z. Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** That's fair.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** But 15 minutes later, oh, by the way, I had this thing on.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** I just can't.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I can't.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** One week later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Right.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** A statute of limitation.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** Even though our GM got to undo all of the weird stuff that he did in that one episode.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** After we all hired him on that one.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** I know, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** And I was nice enough to let people still wear their environmental suits for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:27]** an hour and a half later fair enough i don't i don't want to i don't want to like environmental suit it's the whole day it's fine but i will reduce it back to my negative so while he's i'll just say this quickly before you go john um so he does notice though that this this gun could be he knows

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** the junk cannons, that there are light versions of this gun.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:34]** So he thinks to himself, are you sure, Kevin, that this is a heavy and not a light version?

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Because there are light versions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:45]** The book that was given to me that I'm running this game from has it, and it says rubbish cannons, two-handed heavy weapons, and there are three variations.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** This is the light version of that, but it is not a light weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Right.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:56]** There's a light, a standard, and a heavy, and they all require heavy proficiency.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Oh, yeah, you're right.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** I just saw that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Not confusing at all.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** I'm sorry.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** I'm trying my hardest, and GMing is not easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** Thaddeus is eating his words this entire time.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** That's right.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:09]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:13]** Let's re-ask that in Thaddeus' voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:32]** Kev, I'll just tell you, if you take 20 on a computer's check to hack a system with countermeasures without first disabling or destroying them, the countermeasures are automatically activated.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** That's the only thing.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I'm not doing the check.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** You had just asked.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** You were like, if there's a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:41]** I'm just now knowing that we haven't officially said what happens after take 20.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** I was giving you a minute to read that while we were talking to Thaddeus.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** So knowing that, do you still want to take 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Clarifying question.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Rolled a nine.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** Would that be enough to know that there are countermeasures in place?

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** To know whether or not there are countermeasures in place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Rolled with a nine.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** You are confident that you know whether or not there are countermeasures in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Yes or no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** I, I'm going to say that's not enough to know whether there are or not.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Cool.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Take 20.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Take 20.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** It is.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** All right.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** So you're like, I got this guys.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Hold on.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** And you start typing away.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:25]** You take the full 20 minutes and some like roller knowing this is kind of like watching his clock waiting 19 minutes and 50 seconds, 19.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** He's just like something, something doesn't feel right.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:58]** and then it unlocks oh okay nice and so this this data pad contains the accounts of a vesk named Zethelred's quests to find tougher and tougher threats to throw himself against though these notes are written in shorthand and that leaves out some details so after reading all this you get a sense of Zethelred's personality and his goals but not exactly what happened to him he's clearly not in this camp


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:25]** one of Zethra's final notes simply reads collected supplies backslash backslash junk construct alright guys I got good news and I got bad news the good news is well the good news is sure Rulu the good news is there's a supply cache very likely nearby

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:35]** The bad news is there's also a junk construct very likely nearby.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Clarifying question.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Is there a timestamp on this entry?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** And how long ago was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** If so, that is a good question.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** There is.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:49]** And it is about a week and a half out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** Hmm.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Hmm.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** Rereading this message and the timestamp, there was a supply cache a week and a half ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:07]** I think you're pretty confident that the supply cache that you're probably referring to is this shack.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** This is probably his home base.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:13]** This is where he... Gotcha.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:22]** So this Vesk created this area, probably knew of the torpedo mines and utilized them as a self-defense.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** But like I said, he's a survivalist, a military expert.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:51]** probably a big game hunter and he's no longer at this camp gotcha at least um is there he's out in the bush perhaps is there anything resembling a grave nearby oh what a grave why would he bury himself well like if he had if he had uh i'm assuming the ship was piloted by more than one individual if he'd lost crew members hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Yeah, I wouldn't say.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** There's nothing apparent.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:58]** Maybe there's a place nearby that he would take them to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:09]** But you've got to also understand that this, like we said decades ago, this thing crashed, so he might not be from the ship itself, but migrated to the ship in search of something more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** Scrubbing through the rest of the messages, is there anything else about this construct?

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** That's all that refers to a construct.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** Junk construct.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** You might want to keep your eyes peeled for a junk construct.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Good job.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** How does he take his coffee?

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** So you find a microwave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:56]** and a french press and an empty ice cream carton is there an electric kettle no no it's solar power shakes his head plebeian all right so you guys what roland wants to take a 10 minute rest since this seems like a place sure i'll say you could take a 10 minute rest while he was doing mistake 20 if if jock's not going to take us to take a 10 minute rest too yeah no i'm good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Hey, Weps, you might want to put that Aegis on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Way ahead of you.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:06]** Actually, I'm putting on this new armor, the Golemforged Plating II Environmental Protections one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:11]** Are you qualified to wear heavy armor?

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** I am indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** He is literally the only one in our party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** We're a party of unique individuals.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** What is dawning armor?

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** How long does that take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** I thought it was 10 minutes.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Well, actually, I don't know.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** I think it depends on the armor.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Let me see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** I think it's different for powered armor, but I think all the other armors fall.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Heavy armor requires... Oh, I'm wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** 16... Minutes?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Rounds.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** 16 rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** What a weird measure.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** John, what are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Dude, I'm reading the book, bro.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:48]** So a round is 6 seconds, right?

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Yeah, so that's what?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** 96 seconds?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Okay.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** It's so random.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:59]** I guess they kind of take into account that you might be putting on armor in the middle of a fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** Right.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Light armor takes four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** So you're like... But that is... I mean, that's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:10]** A minute and a half to put on heavy armor is like... You're cooking.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** You're cooking with a gas.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** All right.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Should we move out?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** Do we think we need to explore this ship or do we keep moving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** I mean, can we explore this ship?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** Is there an obvious opening to the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Yeah.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:28]** So the ship's actually kind of on the top of the... This is like a canyon almost.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Yeah.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Oh, okay.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:33]** And the ship's kind of sitting up on top, and that's where the shadows are coming from.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Those guns are sticking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Gotcha.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** So we can't go on in.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** All right, cool.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** I guess we'll go west then.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, we'll continue west.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** You can go west.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** You can also go back across the minefield if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:45 - 00:34:03]** let's uh yeah let's totally i think we found a place where we need where we could long rest if we need to but now we're fine we keep going oh yeah how about we we try to reorient uh with the beacon that is a great idea let me take a look


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:24]** guitar bearings and uh vario 13 kind of groups up with you and pulls out their data pad and and was like i i may have been wrong about that the last entry it looks like we should be going further west west it is awesome and three torpedo mines jump up out of the sand and follow you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:29]** Three torpedo mines in a suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:36]** They come over and they make coffee.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:39]** Ice cream.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** That's very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** Alright, so you guys are heading along again like you're walking through a desert.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** The big canyon kind of dies away and you find yourself back out into the openness.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Um...

**[00:34:52 - 00:35:07]** But then the canyons pick back up again, and you're winding through these canyons, and, um... The winding paths through the outer junk fields end abruptly at a crumbled bulkhead of an old starship.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:15]** A small pile of coiled pieces of metal lie on the ground next to a puddle of unidentifiable liquid.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:21]** A pair of Akestis in dirty leather stand over a juvenile K'fok.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** They take turns pulling one leg off, both laughing the entire time.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:33]** One of them tosses this tiny appendage up in the air and fires a ray of acidic energy from their fingertip.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:40]** With a hiss, the leg melts in midair and falls back to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Let me take you to the map.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** What kind of creatures are these again?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** They're small or are they tiny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** Kestis are small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:56]** Unless they're a Rivner, then they might be much larger than small.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Are they saying anything?

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Or are they just laughing?

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Let me see.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** Oh, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** It's actually a Rivner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** Kevin just expanded the token.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** I can't put it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:15]** Control Z. Control Z. Gross.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Oh, boy.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:41]** it's growing uh playing around with this dead kafak over in the corner of this uh dead end here what do you guys want to do are they still uh taking apart yeah they are just very focused on peeling apart this dead this dead kafak and they they speak common or acutonian

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:49]** They probably speak, I don't know if Dukeshti had their own language, I'd have to look that up, but they definitely speak Common and Akatonian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Can we go?

**[00:36:51 - 00:37:03]** Shaq would like to sneak up to here, to about midway across this map, which looks to be on the other side of some junk from these Keshti.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Let's see if he can sneak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Can you roll a stealth for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** I keep forgetting his stealth is terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** You just think he's small so he can be stealthy.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Yep.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** 17.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Okay.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** So let's see what everybody else does.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:26]** I think Roller was about to say something and then just sees Jack start walking up.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** We have comms, right?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** So he can say like, Jack, what do you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:39]** With your comms, I'll say if you want to, you're not certain whether or not they also have comms is all I'm going to say.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:44]** So like whatever you're saying, if it's on an open channel, they might also hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** I think we would have our own channel.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Do you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Do you have your own channel, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** Show me in the book where it says you have your own channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:55]** Show me in the book where it tells that it depends on the frequency.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:59]** My book says whatever talking you do is open and out.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** If you don't want me to talk, I don't need to talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** That's fine.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Having used radios across different properties in like

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:20]** actual practice there's a lot of work that goes into making different radios compatible with each other yeah i'd say you probably have like a 1 in 20 chance that these guys aren't listening to your channel


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:25]** Or a 1 in 20 chance that they are listening, I guess, would be... Because there's probably about 20 channels available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** Yeah.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** Based on how congested future Spectre might be.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** I would take that.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:34]** So if you want to roll a dice, if... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** No, because I don't know.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** I don't have anything important to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:42]** Can we go... There's like a sort of... It looks like an AT-AT or something, like Fel.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** I guess it's a piece of a ship, right?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Like, can we go inside of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Did you mean an AT-AT?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** Or an AT-AT, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** I have a separate question, but I will wait for the answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:00]** Okay, so just for the listener, this is kind of a big cul-de-sac.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:10]** It's a U-shaped cavern and there is a large, it looks like a tower or something on one side of it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** with these two arms that are coming out to the center.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** Those two arms, for you guys to know, are up in the air.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** So you can travel, and I'm highlighting them on the map for you.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:28]** You can travel underneath the arms, but this area where Chak currently is standing is congested.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:32]** So if you're going to walk across this area, I'm going to need an athletics check.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** I have a question.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Or you move half your speed.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:56]** okay first of all i want to know uh what is the bulk of the uh corpse jesus i don't know man why is bulk questions book of what corpse the corpse of the oh the fuck uh definitely less than one yeah small creature easily less than one book

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Does it still have its head?

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** I'm going to say no.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Okay.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Is the head around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Did you say we could go in this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Say again?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Can we go in this or not?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** I might have missed it.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** You said that we can.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Go in what?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** This thing, the AT-AT, that's now passed out.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** It's a starship.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** It's a big ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** I know, but can we go in it?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:24]** No, you can't go inside of it, but the arms that are right here...

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** are sticking out, but, like, arching down.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** So you can go underneath them here, but not here.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** We can't go on top of them, though, correct?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** If you want to do a climb action, you are more than welcome to try to run up the arms.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** You can do that stealthily.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Okay, roll a six die.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** I want 60 D20s.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:46]** One for stealth, one for acrobats, one for athletics, one for... I don't know.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** I'll make him up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Bluffing.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay, I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** So, okay.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Who's going to move now?

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** So, right now, Shock has moved forward.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** The rest of you are up against the wall, including Vary13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:01]** Well, Thaddeus will go to where Shock is, and he's going to do f***ing stealth.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Okay.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** Which, I guess, because of his heavy armor, is now a minus one.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** I just realized that, which is not... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Uh-huh.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Metagame moment.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Are we...

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Are we just going to ambush these guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** I don't think we've decided.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** That's not going to be possible because I rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:24]** Also, before anything else happens, roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Oh, come on.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** I'm sorry, guys.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** City being my heavy armor.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** 24.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** That's an intimidate.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** I messed up, Kevin.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** That's not 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** 20.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Thaddeus had a 24?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** It's actually a 10.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** I rolled intimidation instead, so it's a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Wait.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** I will go first.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Math, but okay.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Terme, you had?

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Dirty 20.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Dirty 20.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Okay.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:55]** Roloo got a 23.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** 23 for Roloo?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Got an 11.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** 11 for Chuck.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Cool.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** So I was going to let you guys set up if you guys could keep it stealthy.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** That would have given you a surprise round.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** However, you failed at that.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:16]** I'm not going to say there's an automatic fail because of one, but it's pretty bad.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** They get a surprise round.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** So go ahead, Thaddeus.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** Move where you are going to move to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:27]** I think it's just going to move right here, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** Right at where the arms drop on the floor, but away from the other side.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** I guess the heavy arm is just like clank, clank, clank everywhere.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** That's probably why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** Cool.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** It is Rolu's turn.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:48]** Rolu is going to take about 10 feet.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:54]** He's going to step forward and swiftly two of his hands are going to bring out his rifle.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** And he's going to point it at them and then stop.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** And he's going to ready his action.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:06]** Trigger being that he's waiting for them to take an offensive action and shoot at him or at Chak or Thaddeus.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** And he's just going to shout across this area.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:30]** uh open field and say you have an opportunity to leave alive okay so just ready in action does change your initiative order yes and your trigger is before they take an offensive action this is there's it's tricky because it says like if you're being defensive you move first but if not you move after

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:35]** Yeah, I think my action is offensive because I'm going to shoot them.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** So if they shoot, then I'll go after them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:41]** Okay, I'm just going to move you now because we know what's going to happen.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:54]** All right, so now it is Vahri 13's turn, and they are actually going to just stay up in the very top left corner of the map and hide from behind all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Which language is Roli using for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** Rolu is going to use Akatonian.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Okay.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Turbay, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:17]** To me is going to use the newly found mind circlet mindlet mind link circlet mark one.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** I believe I've been trying to read through the rules.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:27]** I believe that if I do more than one person, it's not two way communication.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** So it's there's no way for me to.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:49]** to have a conversation with them telepathically, but I can certainly say something to the effect of, uh, if you don't put down your arms this instant, we will do to you what you've done to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Going to assist with that.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** And he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** You can't assist when we're already in initiative action.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Oh, really?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** My bad.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:05]** So, Termay, you're giving out this command, but you were readying in action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** So, I was attempting, I guess, to demoralize, maybe.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:15]** So, you're actually going to try to do a change to their...

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:23]** So as a standard action, you can use intimidate to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to become shaken for a number of rounds.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** This is a sense dependent ability.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:34]** The DC of this check is equal to 10 plus your opponent's total intimidate skill bonus or 15 plus one half.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:38]** One minus one half of the opponent's CR, whichever is greater.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** If you succeed, the target is shaken for one round.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Duration increases by one round.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:48]** For every five by which the result of your check exceeds the DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:49 - 00:46:00]** All right, this is a little bit of a spoiler, but I've got the PDF open, and I'm trying to get to DCs and stuff, and I accidentally typed Technomander, which is kind of funny.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** So do I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:21]** so the range of 30 feet uh i would assume is based on communication but maybe not so i guess i would have to move up to do that which i would yeah yeah so you're gonna move up i think communication is 30 feet do i have to be 30 feet from both of them since i'm doing it to whichever ones you want to talk to if you're gonna talk to multiple they both have to be in your

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** Well, okay.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Is the mind link circlet?

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** What's the range of that?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** I'm trying to look that up too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** The mind link circlet is 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:34]** Yeah, you have the range to walk up to where you need to in order to make it.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** I was looking up.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** You said it's a will save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Mind link circlet?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Intimidation...

**[00:46:42 - 00:47:12]** standard action cause a creature shaken total intimidate skill bonus if they have intimidate skill bonus or 15 plus 1 minus 1 half the opponent's CR nice 1 minus 1 half so 1 half or 1 plus 15 plus 1 minus half times the opponent's CR so if your CR level is 3

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** You take half of that, which puts you at 1.5.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** No, it's one, one half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** No, it's, it's, well, I know what you're saying, but it's 1.5.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:28]** Cause that's always been the DC for like, it's like 15 plus 1.5 times the CR of the creature.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** Order operations, man.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:55]** right that's true but i'm just saying that that is not for some reason paizo didn't denote it as like yeah i think it's written as it's not a minus 1.5 yeah it's one one half yeah so what is that number uh well whichever is higher for me to know and you to find out so 15 plus one and one half of their dc's i have to do a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** I hit 25.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Oh, you rolled it.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** Well, I rolled my intimidation check.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** You're right.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:08]** You're lucky because I failed it on my roll, but my roll doesn't count.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:18]** So if I exceeded it, though, by five of your check, then that's another round that you're shaking.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** So I'm shaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** I'm shaking.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** Am I shaking at all if I just fail?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** You're shaken for one round if you fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** They are shaken for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** And what does shaken do?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** Minus two penalty to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** That's interesting because it's their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** And the first one, hold on a second.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** What was it again that you said, Tremé?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:55]** I said, put down your weapons or we'll do to you what you've done to that kafak.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Both are not holding any weapons.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:10]** And he holds his hands down, kind of out, and two bluish missiles fly out of his hands.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** Are they magic missiles?

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** They are, in fact, magic missiles, and they hit automatically?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** No, except they don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Who are you trying to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:34]** I'm going to see this, and as a witch word, I have the ability to absorb and catch magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** God of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Okay.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** So you can catch a magic missile or you can catch all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:49]** As a reaction, a witch word can use any number of its free hands to catch magic missiles, plural, from the spell of the same name fired at it.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:57]** Doing so absorbs the missile and manifests as glowing nimbus around the hand, which no longer considered free.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:05]** The energy lasts six rounds or until it is used to create an additional force bolt, which is basically a magic missile.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** To use this ability, the witch word must be aware of the incoming magic missile and cannot be flat-footed.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** The foresight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** You're not flat-footed.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** You probably saw it coming.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** Torme it in with the Uno reverse card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** I know, right?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** I'm still confused.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** So it says with a reaction, you can capture multiple missiles?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** It says, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** One per open hand.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Any of its free hands can have magic missiles.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** So it's yes, plural.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** So how many hands did you have free?

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** I have two.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** No.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Let me see.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Yeah, I just have the pistol.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** So I actually have three.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** Three hands free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** And this was a full round attack.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** Because the catch didn't move.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:47]** I mean, it's... So you catch all three magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Dang.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Wow, wow, wow.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** That's dope.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Made for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** It's made for this.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** God, it's so good we have Will on our team.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** You were saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** That's the end of the Akesti's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** I didn't see that coming.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** It is now Rolo's turn.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Yes, it is Rolo's turn.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:17]** Rolu is going to shoot and unload a round into that Akeshti.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Which one was that?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Was that the northern Akeshti?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** That was the southern Akeshti.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** The southern Akeshti.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** Southern Acoustics.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** You heard of the Southern accent, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** The Southern Acoustics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** I'm a Southern Acoustic from Savannah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:40]** John used an Australian accent for Harag, so now all my Acoustics have to be in Australian, so I was trying to do Australian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** Well, you have to understand that the Riveners have a bit of a crazy accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** The Riveners are from way down under, but we... Way down under.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Way down under.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** The more civilized Akeshdi civilization.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** We're just from the south.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** Like molasses dripping off the tongue.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** Some lemonade on the front porch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** That was an 11.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** 11 for what?

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** My attack.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Can I get more detail?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Is it E-A-C?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** K-A-C?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** Oh, it's the E-A-C.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** I don't know why I asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Doesn't matter.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Whichever one's lower.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Cool.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Yeah, then I super miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** Also, you don't even have a line of sight, so take another minus two off of that.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** I mean, it made sense that I missed anyway, so yeah.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** See, it all makes sense.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** So it flies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** It makes sense.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Chuck, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Am I fully obscured behind whatever this bridge is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** You rolled high enough stealth that you are still hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Right, but can I see the riveners from here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:43]** So you could probably see the one Rivener that's further north.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Yeah.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** But not the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Just a quick check.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Are they Riveners or are they regular?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Sorry.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** No, Akeshjiz.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Okay.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** I blame Vinny.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** That was Vinny's fault.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** I might have said reveners.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** My bad.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** I can make them reveners.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Hold on.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Nah, it's cool.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** No, I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** For the listener, I'm a little bit hungover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:10]** Definitely not obscured anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** It's taken up eight blocks.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** So I'm going to pull out my light fast fault blaster.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** I'm going to take a quick measurement before...

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I say that.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** Hey-oh, I'm within 20 feet.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:28]** Yeah, I'm going to pull my light asphalt blaster and bust a cap in this melon farmer.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Nice.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** That is a nine to hit.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** That misses.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Doesn't matter.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Definitely misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:39]** Man, Jack and I are on the same wavelength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** And now you've given away your position.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** They know.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** It's Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:52]** So I'm guessing we can fire over this stuff since Shaq just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** No, Shaq fired under it, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Okay, then Thaddeus will fire under it.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** Thaddeus will get on his knees next to Shaq's height and be like, hello.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** And then he's going to fire under this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** I guess that is what I'm saying.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** which I've never done before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** Honestly, like if you, if you moved like, like here, here, you'd have like clear shots.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:21]** If you're here, if you're where you are currently, I'm going to say you have partial cover or they have partial, but no, it's one of those things like, yeah, you're right.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** They,

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** it would be partial cover for you, but not for them because you're closer to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:32]** I love the mental picture of Thaddeus getting prone and being at eye level with Chuck standing up.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** With Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** He lays down to shoot, but then he's like, okay.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** What's going on?

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** Because Chuck's just right there.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** But if you're going to go prone, I'm going to say that's a swift action to go prone, right?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** So you can do that, but it's going to take time to get up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** So...

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** Well, that will not be super advantageous.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** So I'm not going to do that.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** Instead, he's going to be like, oh, never mind.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** And then he's going to, you said here is okay, right?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** Yeah, that's a full shot.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** I'm just going to move back a little bit where I have more clearance.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** And then because I moved, I can't do a full action.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** But I'm going to do a ranged attack.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Okay.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** That's a 14 to hit.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Does that hit?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Is that K-A-C or E-A-C?

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:15]** I think that's K-A-C because it's injection projectile, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Ting!

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** You hear on the metal behind him.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Sorry.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** So it doesn't hit.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** You missed!

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:30]** It is now that Akeshi's turn.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Great.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:35]** And they are going to use Magic Missile!

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Of course.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** In a full action.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** I will do the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** You have done the same.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Oh, yes.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** On whom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** There's a reason why it's good.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:46]** One, two, three missiles at both of you.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** So two on Thaddeus and one on Chuck.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** And they hit automatically.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Right?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Am I right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Yeah.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** So let me just roll this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** I don't know if I can do it multiple times.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** I mean, it's really unclear if I can absorb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** It says once per day.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** I saw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Oh, okay.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** And you have to be targeted, right?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** No, I don't have to be targeted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:12]** Unless you've thrown those three back, those hands are now considered occupied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Yeah, I agree to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** You could throw them back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:20]** I'd argue that you have to be the one that's targeted or in the line of sight of the other one.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Who wants to take the first hit?

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** It's a four plus one for five.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** You...

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** The first one goes to Thaddeus.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** The second one is... He'll be brave.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** He's the big guy.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Also a four.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** Wait, they both go to me?

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** The two or the three go to me.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Ten points of damage.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:42]** Oh my god.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:59]** no i don't oh yeah that's right it's still equipped huh yeah i'm going to use my breakaway i shouldn't have to remind you of things like that but yes okay so your breakaway just good for five so the first the first one comes i can't use that on top of my like golem forge though i'm guessing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Oh, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** Oh, cute.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Love that.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** All right, cool.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** He's layering.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** It's a layered look.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:10]** But golem armor is useless against magic missiles.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** It must be so huge looking right now.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** It's incredible.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** All right, so... That's why you failed your stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Yeah.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** It is amazing.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** It's a layered, huge armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** He's a cat, exactly.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** But it sounds like Spurs.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** That first magic missile comes flying around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Meow, meow, meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** kind of weave in between things, goes right through Chalk's bushes.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:36]** And you put up your arm and it hits your arm.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:41]** And your A just breaks away as it's supposed to.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** For a total of six damage then.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Yes.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Well, that was five damage there.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** It takes out five.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:53]** The second missile hits you right in the chest as you're already blocking that first shot.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** So you still take five points of damage.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** And then the last one...

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:20]** that one goes for chuck and it's also a four man oh my god so that's five points of damage to chuck woof that last missile goes boom right on top of you uh let's go back to vari's turn they are going to stay in that corner and it is termay's turn thanks a lot very uh so which one threw the missiles at me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** The one to the south.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** This one here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Nobody's hit these guys yet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Yeah.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** Well, that's about to change, I think.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** Hey, you over there.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:37]** Can you catch Mr. Akeshdi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** Well, he's still shaking.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:46]** from the idea of the intimidation.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:53]** But he's also shook by the fact that you just caught his mattresses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Pretty freaking bad.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** So yeah, I'm going to throw them all back at him.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:01]** Nice.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** All three.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Yeah, well, he threw three at me.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Okay, but you use something different.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** What are you using?

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Force Bolt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:13]** It's Force Bolt, but it's effectively the exact same thing as Magic Whistle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** Can you send three?

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** What does it say?

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:38]** it's just like a racial trait for magic missile basically is that also i wish i hope it says that it's like forest bolt is just a racial trait of i mean i have to that's fair i just want to know i just want to know the mechanics it is automatically hits for 1d4 plus one it's the same is yeah i'm looking at archives of nethus and it says there's a maximum of two per round


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:55]** are you looking at the witch creature oh yeah i am as a standard action the witcher can throw a magic missile this is under force bolt so force bolt is su which i always forget that stands for special ability or something super super ability

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:01]** Uh, as a standard action, a witch word can throw a magic missile as per the spell of the same name.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:14]** One D four plus one force damage from each hand, each free hand or hand that has absorbed a magic missile with the absorbed force ability to a maximum of two missiles per round.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:22]** Which word can throw an additional force bolt from each hand that was absorbed by Magic Missile, expending... Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** So I can get an additional time.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:27]** You can actually throw four this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Yeah, that's why I don't understand that.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:32]** So you can throw a maximum of two, and then it says which word can also throw two more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:38]** So I can actually throw two this round.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** I still have one left over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:42 - 01:01:08]** that i caught what what i think this is saying is you can throw two on your own like because you're a witch word you can throw two additional that you absorbed this round yeah that's that's how i'm reading is that you can throw that just throw it twice you can throw four force bolt from a free hand so you can just automatically throw a force bolt but since you caught them then you could throw all three well and i can throw my own did you have you'd have to drop your pistol to do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** Yep.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Well, okay.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** I'll give you, yeah, you can throw three.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Well, four, if I draw my pistol.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** You can throw three or throw four and drop your pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** Or just throw two and do something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** What do you mean by do something else?

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** Because this would be your standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** It's a standard action, so I can move.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Right.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]** Or I can do anything equivalent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]** I don't think the quantity changes the fact that it's a standard action is what I'm reading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:33]** No, because a full round action for Magic Missile is three.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** So when he casted it, he did a full round action.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** Yeah, that's how Magic Missile is written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** So if you... Yes, I can see how that could be a corollary.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** But it doesn't say... It's a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Sorry?

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:53]** But for what he said, he said, I can throw two and do something else, but I'm going to say the two he threw took a standard action.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** I'll let him throw three as a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** You can throw two as a standard action.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** You can throw three as the same standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:59 - 01:01:59]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Either way, it's a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** You can technically throw up to four as long as you drop your pistol first.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** You can throw all four as a standard, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** I'm really confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Is there max per day for this thing?

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** This is ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** Yeah, it's a once per day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Well, I'm not going to throw any more magic missiles at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:22]** Every two magic missiles caught using its absorbed force ability, a witch word can use its force bolt ability in additional.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** Okay, so it's just saying I can cast it twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:28]** Yeah, you can do two on your own with free hands.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** You can do two more because you caught them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]** I'm going to throw two at the one that threw three at me.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** And I will retain one in hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:40]** I also want to... I just kind of toss it to yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:45]** I think it's worth noting that I think these rules were written assuming characters have two hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:51]** But this is a witch word, though, and it's a racial trait for a witch word, which is inherently forearm.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** I'm done.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:57]** Is force bolt not a spell you can take out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:01]** Because the extra two throws doesn't make any sense if you only have two hands.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** It's definitely written for a witch word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:12]** Okay, so I got a five on the first one and a four on the second one, so nine points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** Dang.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** Do you throw them, like, just clarified, was it right-handed, left-handed?

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** Is it side to lower ones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** Is it underhand?

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** It's like I'm doing a slider pitch back at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** And how much damage was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Nine points of damage.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Catch this, Akash-D!

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:45]** You kind of underhand both those missiles, and you kind of just lob them, and they fling up, and they hit this Akash-D right in the kisser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:52]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Right in the kisser.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Pow.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** Right in the kisser.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:57]** I want to know if they died.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:13]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
