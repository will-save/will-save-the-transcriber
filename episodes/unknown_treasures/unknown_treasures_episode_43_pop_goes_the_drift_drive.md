**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:02]** My name's Kevin.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** I am your GM for unknown treasures.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:06]** And I have a sore throat.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** I'm just letting you guys all know that.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Sorry.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:10]** You didn't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** You don't sound like you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** That's good.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** I'm glad you guys can't hear it.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:14]** You sound great, man.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:17]** I can feel it, but I don't know what it is.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** I just got over a cold, right?

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:23]** I went through a whole week of snot and headaches and everything else.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:30]** Got over it, passed it, and then as it's coming off and I feel that relief, my chin swells up like a bullfrog.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** It's stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:36]** Do you have an excess of moisture in your... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:39]** We were talking earlier about the word moist and moisture.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Is it moist or dry?

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** Is it dry or moist?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** Apparently people don't like the word moist, so apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** The word dry is not as offensive as the word moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** I won't do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** I'm all drugged up on ibuprofen and I have a soda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** How do I mute somebody else's mic in Zoom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** How are you guys feeling today?

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Nature's cure right there.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** You guys are all good?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Yeah.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Give me a health check.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Each one of you guys.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** Give me all your symptoms for anything going wrong.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I have a slight headache from listening to this.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:17]** I have slightly high blood pressure from Will using moisture earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** I didn't say the word, though.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** I did.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:26]** Also, Denny, I'm just impressed that you have the technology to check your, like, you're just good.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** You're just like, yeah, I periodically check my blood pressure.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** And that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** He's just so in tune with his body.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** You feel it.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** It's just like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** We have the technology.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** I've got a headache from dealing with all these audio issues.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Yeah.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** It's good.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** It's frustrating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:48]** For the listeners, we're talking about changing our platforms for how we do things here and testing things out, and it's just not going well.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:52]** To bring you more higher quality content on demand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Yeah, we're working on it.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** Yeah, and also higher quality content for us.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:59]** So we have a better experience because we're all remote.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** So with like a platform that we use, trying to make it even better.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** And of course, things go wrong.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** So that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:08]** But it's like one step forward, two steps back every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** Can I talk a little bit about something really boring?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Dude, of course.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yes, I'm into it.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:18]** You know how much time I spent this week doing this thing that no one cares about until they do?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** Taxes?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** I've probably spent four hours...

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:42]** uh i feel like everyone cares about taxes especially this time of year because they get fat checks uh unless you're in the one percent i i usually have to pay back the last few years no i've spent like four hours this week just doing cable management oh i i think my my desk is an absolute disaster i don't even try i just hide it all behind my monitors

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** I went to Lowe's.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:48]** I bought the 150-pack of Velcro cable straps.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:54]** And I've got a lot of cable eyesores in my office since I built it because I put a bunch of outlets everywhere.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** And...

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:11]** You know, the cable routing wasn't the best, but shortly, I mean, over the course of a week, I've probably spent four hours just wrapping up network cables and power cables and making sure that these cable paths all go in the same directions so that I don't get lost.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** I don't trip over anything.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** I did all the cable management on my TV this afternoon.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** It's just like, you know, you feel fresh.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** It's like a good spring cleaning activity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:25]** Are you doing the... I have a question for you, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** Are you going to put like the holes in the wall and run your cables through the wall?

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Cause like that makes everything super clean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** And then they just released like, you know, like wireless power at that point.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** And you're like, ah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** No, I've got my, I have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:46]** I've got my TV cables fished in the wall, but like in here, because everything is behind either a monitor or a computer, I haven't fished anything.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Go ahead.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Well,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:53]** So you went to... Did you say Best Buy to get the Velcro cables?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** I went to Lowe's.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:01]** Why didn't you get proper plastic cable ties?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** Like zip ties?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:09]** Yeah, because effectively you're trying to create a permanent solution for many of these things.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Or semi-permanent.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** It's not permanent with zip ties.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** No, but it's certainly more permanent than, than the Velcro straps.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** What I like about the Velcro straps is I have flexibility and reusability.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** So like, I dig that.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Yeah.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** So like I can, I can take out, I can replace the network cable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:32]** Are you changing the straps behind your TV at a rate where you need to have the flex?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:41]** Like if I have a Velcro for like specific things, like all of our cables for the show, those are, are, you know, they get reused.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** Right.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** But like things that don't get reused.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** I'm not going to waste a Velcro on dinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:54]** I, I use Velcro everywhere just because my brain, like I will go in 18 different directions in three weeks.

**[00:05:55 - 00:06:01]** And so I would rather have Velcro straps than 25 cut cable ties.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** And they're also easier to work with.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** I think I don't have to have a tool to remove it.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Uh, I see lots of hands.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeah.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:16]** Mine was to pivot a little bit to a same umbrella topic, different thing.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** So Kelly, if yours is about this, please go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:24]** Oh, I was just going to say Vinny has, he's self, well, I was going to use the word self-diagnosed.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** That's not the right way of putting it.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]** He is, has, but admits, I should say, that he has ADD.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** What are you going to say, Kelly?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:36]** On Instagram, a lot of things that he posts on his stories are like, you know, things about ADD.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** And yeah, they're really fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** His Instagram is just a bunch of kittles and Velcro.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** Yeah, so the 18 different directions thing, I get that.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** I know what you mean.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:50]** Also, I need some A-B situation for switching between my two computers here, so maybe I'll ask you something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** I got something fun for you guys since we're talking about cable management.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** Why don't you just steamroll over what I was going to say?

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** I think I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** I thought you said something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** No, he wanted to pivot to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Oh, I thought you did pivot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** What was the pivoting?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** Nope.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:17]** I was just going to say that actually in the spirit of switching between computers, Kelly, I have specifically tried to get some of the little sticky guides that you put at different parts of your desk.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** That way cables can just sit up and ready to go.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** Those are pretty cool.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:32]** And I have to say for switching between my work laptop and the recording laptop, that has been very easy to where it's like one, two switches and everything's already switched over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** But is it a button you can just press?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** No, I don't have a KVM switch.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I need a button.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:43]** Yeah, because I have bought dedicated cables that stay plugged in other than the power cable.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** So then that way, you know, it's good to go.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** That's cool.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** That's way better than what I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:53]** Yeah, I'll throw up a photo in the Discord whenever we publish this episode.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** So I ended up, because I've got a work laptop in my personal laptop.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** And I've got a single dock.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:04]** So like I just unplug from my Mac and then plug into my work desktop work laptop.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** But I also printed because I've got a 3D printer.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Really love it.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Everyone should buy one.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** They're dirt cheap.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** I printed like a two slot.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** I guess it sits like that.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** It's a two slot vertical laptop stand.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:21]** So like my Mac sits in front of my work laptop and they both sit right next to each other on my desk.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** That's so it's legitimately just yoink and plug in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** That I think is best.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:30]** I use my laptop screens as an additional screen.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** So I have three screens.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:39]** But I would like to move to your setup because then that means that you have three external monitors instead of a tiny laptop screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Yeah.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** I've got two 27-inch.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** I think they're 1440p.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** I do what you do, John.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** I have my work laptop and then I have my personal laptop.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:53]** And I usually swap out my USBs and I have to change out the HDMI cables.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** But it works.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** Mine's like three quick moves and it's almost muscle memory now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:02]** Will and I are like... Sorry, I interrupted you, Kevin.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** What were you going to say?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** You're fine.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** You were in a rant for a second there.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:09]** I don't like interrupting your rants, so... Was it a rant?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** It wasn't a rant.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** It was just about to become one.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** It was building up to a crescendo, and I stopped it.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** I don't think he had the rant ready.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** All right, I'm sorry.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:24]** I was hoping there would be... Will and I, like, well, and I'm sure Vinny and... Well, I... Anyway.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:52]** all right look we we like are you assuming about me we're programmers so such a preamble vinny's an honorary programmer he's basically programmed anyway so like here's the thing like we will do a lot of work to be lazy so we like front end so much work just to like you know yeah work very hard and like i don't want to switch out cables man i can't so laziness pays


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** I'm going to put a link in our chat in Zoom.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:01]** Because it's a single USB Type-C cable is my entire dock.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Yeah, that's what I have.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** So that's both monitors.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** That's my wireless stuff that's not Bluetooth.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** That's my connection to the interface.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** I've got a stream deck for common stuff that I use.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** And it's all run through this one dock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** That's brilliant.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** How much IO do you have?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:21]** Because I have looked at getting those docs, and they are like at least $200.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** Yeah, they're a lot for enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** This one, I think I paid like $150 for.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, I kick-started one, and I still haven't gotten it yet.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** That's why...

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** I know he kickstarts a lot of things, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** A lot of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:41]** Listen, I believe in independent creators and entrepreneurs as well as inventors.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:48]** And so I wish to throw away money into the dumpster fire that is Kickstarter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** I believe in them, but I don't believe that I'll get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Still waiting on my pixel day.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:57]** I think we also, in general, the spirit of our podcast is supporting creators and stuff.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** Except we f***ing deliver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** That's the difference.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** We actually deliver for you people.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** That's the f***ing difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** That's the difference.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** I do want to say, so speaking of believing.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** I think it's time we get back into the game.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Are you guys ready to play?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Is that enough distractions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** There's one more thing I want to do before we play.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** One more thing.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** But it is in transition.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** What's that?

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:29]** The Unknown Treasures landing page has been the gladiatorial combat every session until now.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** We are looking face to face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:38]** I'm staring into the blackness that is a gray's gaze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:39 - 00:12:04]** tormenting my soul it seems yeah it's making me uneasy every time i look away i forget that we're gonna play but then i look back at the landing page and it's it's there again but i look away and it's gone and i look and it's there and it's also hairier there's there's more barrier than i thought i i know he actually has if you look above his like eyebrows like two little black hairs for some reason


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** I don't know if that's hair or lint.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** I don't know what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:10]** Do you think, like, grays are, like... Did you give us a dusty gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** Did you just pull one out of the dumpster, Kevin, and just, like, throw it up?

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** It's grayscale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:20]** Will, were you theorizing about the origins of grays?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** I mean...

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:51]** uh you know there's like all kinds of lore in uh tabletops with grays you know well the origins of this gray was some random picture off the internet um thank you to whoever drew it for us because it's beautiful um we should shout out their name i don't i need to look it up i don't know where it goes person found on google we'll fix it in post yeah yeah we'll fix it in post but you should actually look up the name so we can credit them because yeah that's what we do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** That is the right thing to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Yeah, no, that's the right thing.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** As we as creators should thank other creators.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Yeah.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** I did ask somebody for... I thank all creators who came before me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** We're really just saying, be better, Kev.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** Yeah, I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** I did email one person saying, like, hey, can I use this?

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** And he was like, yeah.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** And I was like, cool.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** So it's very correct of you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** But this is for you guys in the house, so it doesn't matter.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** But now the whole world knows, so I have to go do more work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** Thank you.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** What I really like about...

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:26]** What I love about Javin Kevin right before we start is he always lets us have it at the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Oh, yeah, he does.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** He does.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** Speaking of the episode, last time...

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** The doors opened up for you.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** One more thing.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** I quit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** I'm done.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** I'm sorry, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Time for a nicer GM to roll in.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** Let's see.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Who am I voting for?

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** We've tried, John.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Thank you and good night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** I'm going to spend the rest of this episode looking up the person who did this artwork so I can thank them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** Alright, alright, alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** In all seriousness, this is what I have to say.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Alright, I'm just kidding.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Go ahead, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** So last time, the doors opened up and you found a glowing purple drift drive.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:13]** And a small, thin-bodied figure with a large, elongated head with pitch-black eyes.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:21]** You were then thrusted to absolute darkness, save for the glowing blue object in Rolo's pocket.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:27]** The great creature of myth and legends demanding the gym be headed over to her.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:31]** And Rolu's response was to slam the door shut and run.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** He pulled a Thaddeus.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Chalk and Thaddeus also fell back and prepared to attack.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** But Terme stayed in place.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** He was then engulfed by darkness, but was able to sense the gray standing right next to him.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** He asked her for her intentions.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** She didn't reveal much, but she didn't attack Tomei either.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** The rest held back, waiting with their weapons drawn.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** And then you two were plummeted into darkness once again.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** And let's take you to the map.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Going to the map.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** Going to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Going to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Darkness.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:31]** oh my god i just all i see all i see is like a shadow of roly it's dark in there oh wow this is so good oh my god you know kevin is drunk with power a lot of people sleep on the evil laugh and that's on that's on quality dude i i yeah kevin nailed it just for the listener he did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:43]** They are on a page of pure darkness, absolute blackness, because they're within that storm of magical darkness, and they can't see even each other.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:49]** Termes and Thaddeus' night vision does not function within this sphere.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** And so all they can really see is each other.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** But what stands out the most, actually, they can't even see each other.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:01]** What you really can only see is the glow of the blue object in Rolu's pocket.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** So if you all notice, Rolu has a shade of blue to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:09]** I hope this is like one of those story points that don't turn into combat, but it's kind of spooky.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** You think it's going to, but it doesn't.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** You know what I mean?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** That happens.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** Yeah.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** No, this gray is going to fuck us up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** I kind of feel like we're going to TPK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Yeah, truly.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I mean, just the amount of shit we gave Kevin the last 10 minutes.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** Yeah.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** He's going to TPK us for sure.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yeah.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** He dreams.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** He dreams of doing this to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** I didn't give you any shit, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** And for that, Termay is probably going to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** He was bargaining with the gray, so maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Hey, this is really still dark in here.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:47]** I can't help you in the darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:54]** Termay, can you at all see this blue glow down the hallway?

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:21]** i need you to make your way to it we we are all together and i can't i don't know we're still an initiative can we yeah i was gonna say are we an initiative are we you are and as rolu starts saying this she divines the most vulnerable portion of your mind rolu and overloads it with a glut of psychic information what a good word i need you to roll a will save


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** We'll save.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** We'll save.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** I'm going to die, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Okay.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:35]** Good thing I have a big old plus zero to we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Yeah.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Oh, it's a natural 18.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Yes.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** So that is full damage.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** Hold on.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** I'm trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** What is the DC for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** Full, full damage.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** Higher than eight.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** He said eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** He said 18.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** Oh, I heard eight.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:56]** Dude, Kev and hearing what he wants to hear in this episode.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** He gaslights himself.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** It's like got worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** The horror on my face.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:04]** If only we had video, that would have been spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** I just want to double check.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** Is it saved for half?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Yep, it is saved for half.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:14]** So you're going to take half of 2d10 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Holy cow!

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Two ones, right?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** Two ones.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Dude, come on, man.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** Insta-stroke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Is that the 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** That looks like a 10.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Are you just like... That's a 7 and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** How many dice are you rolling, dude?

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Eight times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** I rolled two d10s.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Seven and six is 13.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** Half of that is going to be six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** Six points of damage.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** Wow.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:47]** I think I start saying to me, can you...

**[00:18:49 - 00:19:03]** As just, like, probably the blue lights, like, seems to cast a bunch of shadows because I think Rolu's hands quickly, in aid, push back against and try and feel for the wall as Rolu's trying to stay upright from taking this damage.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** That's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** And it's now Jelay's turn.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** Wait, Kevin, what are you doing to Rolu, like, exactly?

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** What is the great doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:15]** Is it just, like, bringing up, like, thoughts of, like... You want to roll a mystic check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Well, I can't, but...

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** I just wanted you to roleplay it.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** I want to know.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** I told you what she did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:23]** She divined and overloaded his brain with psychic information.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Like what kind of information?

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Psychic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Are you going to roll his head?

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** You won't be able to know unless you're going to roll his head.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** Why don't you tell us what kind of images you were getting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** That's what I was getting.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** All right, perfect.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Well, he's finally lost it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** Termay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:50]** Termay is still, so he's asked the creature, can you turn the lights on so that I can get to where we're going or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** I have not received confirmation that you are in my assistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** Oh, well, fine then.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** I'll turn the lights on myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:21]** And he waves his forearms, concentrates, and casts an infinite world spell instantaneous where I cause a bright flash of light to fill the area, which I'm presuming I'm still in this small area, right?

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Sorry, what spell is this?

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** This is actually, it's the infinite world.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** It's a standard action.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:32]** I spend a spell and I can create either an environmental hazard

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** Or I can create a bright flash of light to fill the area.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:44]** Each creature within the area must succeed in a fortitude save or be dazzled for one round per Witchwarper level.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** So that's... I'm at level... What are we at?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Three, aren't we?

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** We're at three.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** So three rounds.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** Wait, that means we have to roll a two, right?

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Because I would say... What's the range on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** You could probably choose if you attack...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:27]** well there's no range specified it just says the area fill the area light fills the area so whatever the area the open area is right but i thought we were behind a door you are yeah you're like in a whole other room i'm behind a door with the gray yeah uh you are in yeah you're in that little room vestibule and i thought last round we determined that the gray was in the room with me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Yeah, we never said anything about the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Well, are they open or closed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** You can't tell that unless you do a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I'm still going to cast it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** So Infinite Worlds actually does have a range.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:46]** They have a range of 100 feet plus 10 feet per Witchwarper level.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** So yeah, you can fill this whole building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** 130 feet, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Wow.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** It's amazing.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** Everyone roll a fort save, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Okay.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Okay.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** All right.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Fine.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** It's fine.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Fortitude save.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** 12 for Rolo.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** 18 for Thaddeus.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Don't blind me.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Dazzle me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Oh, wait.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** What am I rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Fortitude save.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** It doesn't give me a DC, though.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** I'm guessing it's like 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** I got a 16 for the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** I'm betting it's a 17, DC.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** What?

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** You're just making this stuff up?

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** I don't know.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I'm looking it up, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** It's almost like he's the GM or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:54]** apologies what's this spell called again it's called infinite worlds it's actually super it's a super thick uh it's a specialty feat a supernatural uh skill as we all collectively google infinite world star finder yeah oh should i start the timer uh what level did you do this at well i'm level three yes two minutes on the clock you're level three so you're doing it at level three

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Well, no.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** No.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** I can't.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:03]** My Witch Warper level is... What is my Witch Warper level?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** It's your current level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** How many levels have you taken in Witch Warper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Okay, so it is three.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** So I can do level three.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:11]** What am I... I was doing a level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I was doing level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:20]** It says the DC is equal to 10 plus the spell level expended to create the effect plus your charisma modifier.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Okay.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** That's what I'm seeing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** What is your charisma modifier?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** I have a plus 3, so it's a 15.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** 16, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Well, you're which?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:34]** 10 plus your level is 3 plus your charisma bonus.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** The spell level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** The spell level.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** Do you only have first level slots at level 3?

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** It's not a spell, though.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** It's a skill.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:46]** It's a skill, but you're burning a spell slot to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:54]** If an effect calls for a saving throw, DC is 10 plus the spell level expended to create the effect.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** So it's DC 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** 14, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Okay, well, I pass then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Yeah.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Well, that was useless.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** Rulu failed with a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** So you dazzled Rulu.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Thank you for that.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** You're welcome.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** Okay.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** So wait, what's your charisma modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:10]** Plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** This might work in your favor to me.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:36]** just saying uh rolu you're up what are you doing you're now dazzled for three rounds yeah uh is it three rounds yeah for which warper level yeah it's yeah it's three rounds that's a minus one penalty um to your attack rolls and your slight sight based perception checks it's not that okay not that uh yeah that's not that bad


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:41]** I think Rulu shakes his head.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:46]** You see his hands are shaky in the blue light.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:51]** And I, as a player, have no idea what Rulu's going to do.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** I don't know if it would...

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** I don't think Rolu would run.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** He knows there's no way out.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** He can't go out the door that's been sealed behind him.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** He doesn't know why that was sealed.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** I don't know what happened.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Presumably the gray.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** And we're here.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Enter May is ahead.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:12]** And I think Rolu has to step up.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** I think he has to step up.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:24]** He's going to, wow, especially now being dazzled, I think he's going to take one.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:37]** His left hand reaches out with a false confidence to touch the wall, and Rolu is going to try his best to move forward in the darkness towards Treme, because that's the last place that he knows that the gray was.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Kevin, what do I need to know about moving in the dark?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** Oh, man, what do you mean?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Oh, wait, you're right.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:50]** I think you have to do an athletics check in order to move more than half your speed, I believe.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** I forget where exactly that's written.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** I think it's just under darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** I mean, he's going to try and take a five foot step, feel what's going on.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Five foot step, feel what's going on.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:05]** Because I, the player, also now don't remember what the map looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** I agree with you.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Let's try to move your character and I'll see what I can.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** How far are you trying to move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** I don't remember how far away it is.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Both Rolu and John don't remember.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** So I know it's within 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Let me.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:24]** Yeah, you can walk as far as you want and I'll tell you when to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** Alright, so he's trying to feel for the door.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** So I move 15 feet now, which is half my speed.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** So do I need to make an athletics check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** I'm trying to look that up.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** I should have had this ready.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** I'm sorry.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** That's fine.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** So are you going to stay at 15 feet or do you want to try and move further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** My goal is to get inside.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** The vestibule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Inside the airlock room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** The lobby, if you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:49]** Okay, so you're going to have to move further than that.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Okay.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** But I still haven't seen about where exactly.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Is it under complete concealment, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** You might just have to make a GM call about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:06]** Maybe I was, I'm thinking of blinded, not darkness, but I think you're effectively blinded if you're in complete darkness.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Basically.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:12]** And so it takes a DC 10 acrobatics check, uh, to move faster than half your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Okay.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** My, uh, my bonus acrobatics is 11.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** So, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** So you can automatically move more than half your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Great.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** So I'm trying to feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Okay.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Keep going.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Oh, you just moved to the right.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** So tell me exactly what you're, how you're moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** He'll walk straight ahead until he hits the wall.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** That's his plan.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** So I've moved so far, you know, feeling with the wall.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I think on my left, I've moved 20 feet.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Okay.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** So 25 feet and I've moved 30 feet.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:43]** That's the extent of my first set of move action.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Am I at the wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** You are as far as you can move is what you're telling me, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Or I've taken a move action.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** I could use another move action to keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** Oh, sneaky.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Okay.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:03]** God, you were making this game so difficult on me.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** I'm going to let you.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** I'm just moving in a dark corridor.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Hold on.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Let me.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** I'm trying to group here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:31]** token this is really cool i i have to say the idea that we're in a dark corridor and one person has a dim light available to them and it's yeah thanks for leaving us behind world who really appreciate it as always team player so you have your okay so just i guess you know which direction not to run in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:38]** They literally see a screen of blackness and Rolo just walked up one full movement.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:45]** Uh, so he is kitty corner with, uh, Treme, where Treme is standing.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** unaware if that door is open or shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** So give me a perception check.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Is kitty corner the one farthest from the fight?

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:56]** Or is it from, like... It's an old term that, like, some people use, but it's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** I think it's because cats always stand on the opposite corner of wherever you think they're supposed to stand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Well, like, because Thaddeus is a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** I didn't know if that was, like... That's true.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:08]** My mom says, like, catty corner instead of kitty corner.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Yeah.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** I don't even know what it is.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** And I just realized that was a joke at my expense, Shaq.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** So thanks a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:24]** hilarious all right so i've moved up do i see the gray at all can i make a perception check i want you to roll a perception check

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** That's fine.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:29]** That is going to be a, with my tiny, tiny die, 20.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** A 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:48]** So with a 20, in complete darkness, you have at least two free hands, and you reach two free hands kind of out and then bring them forward, and you feel the wall with one hand, and you feel where the door should be, and it's not.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** You can feel that the door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Okay.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** I don't feel anything about the gray.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Uh, not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** No.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Nor do I see the gray.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Torme.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Ugh, yes.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Because I can make out Torme's token.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** Torme, let's head back so we're all together.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** I don't want you to be alone fighting this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Okay, target.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Egg.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Ugh.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** There's something glowing in your pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yes, we'll talk about that later.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** I thought you saw that before.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** What did you steal from this gray?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Now is not the time to discuss this.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** I didn't steal anything from this gray.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:28]** Let's get back together so we can fight together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Lord, can you hear this guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** I hear everything.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** You hear that echoing in your heads?

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** What are you going to do?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** You still have either a standard move or a move action.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** Rolu, are you ending your turn here?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Do you want to ready an action?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** Rolu is going to...

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:52]** I'm not going to roll a sense motive yet on Terme talking and calling this Grey Lord and then that Grey responding.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** But yet, but if it happens again, he will.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:07]** So I think there's a lot going on and Rolu's just trying to play emergency stop the dam with some 1-800 tape infomercial.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** So I think Rolu is going to ready an action right now.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** And if he sees the Grey, he's going to take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:17]** So you're readying a ranged attack or a melee attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Yeah, it's only five feet.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:25]** So maybe he will ready right now his melee attack, which is going to be his tactical spear if he sees the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** Copy that.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Chuck, it's now your turn.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** What are you doing?

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** You are standing on Tremay's shoulder.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Oh, I forgot.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** He's actually on my shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** I'm on Thaddeus' shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** Oh, that's what I meant.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** I meant Thaddeus' shoulder.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:36 - 00:32:03]** i think he's gonna stay put i think he's so shook by almost being killed by the uh drift dead and all of the lights being off he wants none of this smoke so uh chak is like visibly shivering like you can see his limbs shuddering he's just gonna like trying to drop a cat into a tub of water just like latch onto thaddeus's head


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** How shook are you?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:12]** Like, are you enough that you should take the shaken condition?

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Oh, come on.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** I'm just asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** I'm asking.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Maybe.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:20]** Let me use my handy dandy core rule book to look at the shook condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Cool.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:27]** So you're just... Are you delaying your turn or your whole turn is holding on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** My turn is holding onto Thaddeus.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:37]** I'm basically withholding my move action so I can move with him, and I can't really ready an action because he wouldn't see a trigger.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** Anyway, so mechanically, I'm saving my movement to move with Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:42 - 00:33:07]** you're not doing anything with your standard action correct all right thaddeus what are you doing thaddeus like this is really strange because like cats they can do pretty well in the dark but even for him this is like really really weird so he's like he's he's not shaken by this or whatever shook per se he doesn't have to take any sort of modifier like that but like he is a it's a little weird but he tells shock he's like hold on shock we're gonna be fine

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** And he like touches the wall.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** This is a narrow hallway.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** He knows that.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** And he just kind of, what's the movement check that I have to do?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** The acrobatics check.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:18]** Acrobatics check greater than DC 10.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** To move half your speed.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Or sorry, more than half your speed.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Oh, like the full speed, right?

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** Okay.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Yeah.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** He can do that.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** Does he have to move it on each move action?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Because they're going to take two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** I want you to tell me what you're doing each move action so I can see if you're going to run to a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:35]** So Thaddeus is going to move... Or not each move action, but each square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** I want you to move one square at a time.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** So five feet, five feet, five feet.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** That way I make sure... Because you can't see anything, but I can.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** So I want to make sure you're not running into walls.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Got you.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:51]** Thaddeus is going to move diagonally to right where Rolu pathed forward.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** So he's moving basically right in Rolu's path.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** What day he did?

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Moved five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** So you're taking five feet diagonal.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Yeah.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** So, so far that's 15 movement.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Did you roll an acrobatics check?

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** I did.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** It was 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** 20.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** And he's going to roll an acrobatics check again.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Do I have to do it again?

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Do I have to pass your check again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** I think you would if it's a move.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** No, you were moving your full move action, right?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** So you could stop at 30 and then take standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** My move action is 20 feet.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** My movement speed is 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:27]** Okay, so to move further, yeah, you can move up to half your speed or roll to see if you go further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** Well, either way, it shouldn't be an issue.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** It's quite high, 25, and he's going to come up right.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** He sees the glow of Rolu right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Oh, yeah, you see the glow in his pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:43]** Yeah, he does, and he just kind of, like... Such a cool... The whiskers on his cheek, like, touch Rolly's... The back of Rolly's neck.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Hey, Rolly.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** It's me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Some butterfly kisses?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Butterfly kisses at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** It is just so cool to just... Again, just this image of, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:26]** fatty is coming up behind rolu with this blue glow on his face it's so creepy it's so good it's so good thanks i find you i find rolu creepy too i appreciate that mechanically thanks will for your face i'm shook uh as will is putting a filter on filter if you search for shook that's how i look right now it's it's very it's very bilbo baggins don't take me for some kind yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** Alright, Benny, you were saying mechanically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:35]** Mechanically, thanks to whomever moved my token, because I could not see Thaddeus in this pitch black screen we're in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Total darkness!

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Such a cool encounter.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** If we can ever see the enemy, which we might not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Might not ever see them again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** I think we're going to get ganked.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** Well, I half hope that happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** It is now their turn.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:51]** And with that, that's the end of their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Alright.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** So cloak and dagger of you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** So you guys are now huddled up against the door.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:15]** You guys are at that first door of the two doors that are in that airlock clean room that enters the lab.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Treme, you're just on the other side of that door.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** The gray is somewhere.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** And it's back at the top of the round.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Rolu, what do you do?

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** Oh, sorry, Tremé, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** I'll send chat.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:39]** Tremé is going to do another infinite world spell, but now with having read all of the options available to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** Hey, I still can't see, does it here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** And I...

**[00:36:44 - 00:37:00]** I'm going to do a second level environmental and I'm going to create a very like loud just sort of

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:22]** overwhelming uh sonic hazard like so we can echolocate this uh this this creature it's an interesting idea i like that yeah is this you're doing the same thing infinite worlds yeah so i'm gonna cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended which level one

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:32]** With a successful fourth save, reducing the damage by half, a creature attempts this save when it first takes damage for this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** You select the damage type each time you use this ability.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Piercing, Slashing, or Sonic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Okay, what's the save on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Is it the same as before, 14?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:48]** Yeah, DC is 10+, the spell level expended, plus my charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** And does it work through walls?

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** I would assume so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Okay, go ahead.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** I think it depends on the frequency and how well he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** I think so, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** I got an 11 for the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Does everyone need to make this safe?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** I think so.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Okay.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** All right.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Sorry, it's what again?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** It's a fortitude?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Yeah.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Okay.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:14]** Fortitude for half, but I don't see what damage I'm...

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** Damage equal to the level of spell slot expended.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** So that's one.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Roli got a 21.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** So you get one damage.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Yes.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:29]** It says a successful fortitude save reduces the damage by half for a second level, a second environmental effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** So one half to zero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Or is it just one to one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** No, one to one minimum.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Yeah.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** It's one minimum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** So everyone takes one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Yeah.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** But you do it each round for three rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Got it.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Jeez.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** So that's kind of cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Cool.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:43]** Yeah.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** And it happens to your allies as well?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Yeah.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Damn, man.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** It doesn't really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** This is very vaguely worded.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Yeah, right.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** I think it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** I mean, I would expect it to affect every creature in the space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** It's an environmental effect.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** So yeah, I would assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Yeah, I think it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** So that is your standard action.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** What are you doing for your move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:08]** Yo, guys, I don't know where this guy is and I can't see anything, but we should just give him the rock.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** Just give it up, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** And he's not going to move.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** He's just staying where he is.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:20]** I'm like in... Am I in the... Can I do a perception check to see if I'm in... I'm not trapped with this thing, right?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** So you're doing a perception check to what?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** What are you trying to figure out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Where this gray is.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:29]** Do I hear anything from this sonic blast?

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** Can I perceive in any way where the location of this gray is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** Roll me a perception check.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Natural 20.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Beautiful.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Four?

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:44]** You did this sonic blast and you damaged everybody in sight.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** But it just vibrates and echoes within that room.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** And you don't sense the gray.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** And you now know that the door to the lab is still shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** Because this has got to be some kind of in-our-heads thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:01]** I feel like this, though, would affect the other room, just FYI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:05]** Right, but you wouldn't be able to hear the... Okay, okay, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** I think the gray's back here, is what I say to the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** But I can't see anything.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Where is back here?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Beyond the door, I guess.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** North of me.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Rolloo.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** I think.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** I'm a little disoriented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Rolloo, can you... We might have to go into the lab.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:23]** Rolloo, can you use your mystic bulls**t to, like, figure out what's happening?

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** Because I feel like... I'm going to try.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:29]** It might be another dimensional thing, or we might be out of the physical realm.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** I don't either.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** All right, good.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:39]** Actually, to me, I second your opinion about trading it, but there's just not enough time to figure that out yet.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Do you think this gray would stop?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** What is this blue rock in your pocket for anyway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** That was not

**[00:40:50 - 00:41:04]** the time to explain this now is the time to remain alive is is that yeah that's what i'm trying to get at room so sneaky i want to roll sense motive but oh okay just while we're at that chalk it is your turn so be ready

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** Do you want to roll a sense motive to me?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** You're rolling it on Rolu?

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Yeah, I got a 19.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Rolu seems like he wants to keep the puck, and he seems like he's truthfully trying.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:20]** He doesn't trust this gray, and he just seems like he's trying to stay alive, and he's not willing to give it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:46]** i i understand that you like yeah yeah what is this thing i i'm not gonna say anything roly hasn't said anything about what it is yet right all that he said last time was that it could help save the pack worlds that's all that he said i think you said the opposite actually um or i guess the contrapositive that giving it to the gray would endanger the pack world's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** I think they're one and the same.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Right?

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** It's basically... Not necessarily the same.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:56]** It has some kind of immense power that if in the wrong hands could destroy the world or in his hands would protect it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** Or could Jaune... Maybe in Rolu's hands it could destroy... We don't know.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** We know that the Grey might do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** He is a filthy pirate.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** So... Who knows?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** Excuse me.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** He's a traitor among pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** That's what makes him bad.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** We have zero commentary on his cleanliness.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** He could be a very clean pirate.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** I imagine he is, at least externally.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** You guys have been in the desert for days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** I don't know if you've taken any baths.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Very regularly.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** He strikes me as the type of person that keeps deodorant in his satchel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** One of his 50 internal pockets.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Yeah, I can see that happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** He's a brain ambassador for dude wipes.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:35]** I think Chak, hearing his colleagues so close, is emboldened.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:45]** And so he's going to try to move toward the doors or where he expects the doors to this inner chamber to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** So you're going to hop off of Thaddeus' shoulders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Yes.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:54]** I'm going to move up on our map north toward where I think the doors are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** So you're still in darkness.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** So give me, I want you to move five feet at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Okay.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** Okay.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:04]** So you're going to, you're basically going to, you, you kind of bump into Rolu as you walk through his square.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** I feel like I five hole Rolu.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** And three, you walk three feet, three squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:33]** i'm counting my arrow taps okay should i can i keep i'm gonna keep hitting it until you tell me not to hold on that's what she said uh so you can go i think one more square right there um as you walk forward you bump like i feel like chalk is just like marching yeah and and you actually bump into the door right there okay

**[00:43:33 - 00:44:00]** and right there is just uh again now we're kind of in a line you have the three characters on the left and then you have termay on the right and it's gonna go staggered it's chalk is in the first square to the top left uh termay is one square down to the right diagonally and then the other two are down to the to the left again diagonally from that cool makes any sense almost like a zigzag pattern i'm gonna look for the controls to like open this door okay do do a perception check do a perception check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Uh, not promising.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:05]** It's a three on the die for nine.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** Uh, you, you're, uh, I've found a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Is it the L fan?

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** Is that what it's called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** Yeah.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** The L fan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Yeah.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** You kind of have those like reaching out everywhere.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:19]** And like one of them runs up to May's, uh, robes and kind of tickles his, his knee.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:43]** uh another one is like reaching on and it feels all the lockers and then the other two you can feel like the outline of the door where you're standing but there's nothing there that's going to open it and you remember that the the key uh card went in the hole on the right and that's where the button's at got to open the doors cool so the button so that's the end of your turn jock are you going to move over and operate oh okay uh i mean i've i've moved and i've interacted with an object

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** Your perception check was free, so you still have a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** I'm going to move and hit the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Yes, that's what I was going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:00]** You can move over one, but that is your movement then is to move, so you can't... Okay, so you're like, you move over one and you're prepped to push that button.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** It's now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Okay.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:07]** Alright, so Thaddeus is going to... Oh, I think you're raising your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** He's doing a slow motion reach for the camera.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:21]** Thaddeus could, like, see in the glow, like, I almost called him Chad, Shaq, like, going over to, like, press the button.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** And he's just, like, he knows what he's trying to do.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** So in the glow, he's going to basically try to do the same thing.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:31]** He's going to move generally where he saw Shaq go, roll perception, and try to press that button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** So you make your way up.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** You kind of shimmy around Rolu and Termay and shuffle forward.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:42]** And you step your left foot very carefully and you feel chalk.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** You kind of bump your foot into chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Yeah.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Roll perception.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** All right.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** He avoids stepping on a vine.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** He rolls perception.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** And it's 18.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** You know exactly where that button is.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** He presses the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Okay.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** That's your turn.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** It is now... Does the door open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:05]** You hear the familiar as that door, the hydraulics to that door open up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** What is the radius of the spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** We were in a huge room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:16]** Also, you guys are still hearing this sonic energy from another dimension reverberating off the walls.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** Oh, man.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** Now that the door is open, can we sense where this gray is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** Possibly, but it's the gray's turn, so let's deal with that first.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Didn't the gray just go?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:46]** we went through a whole round you guys all moved and did stuff it is now the greatest turn that's how the game works initiative order generally i'm just saying i feel like the gray went and all that rolo did was move up but he he he's just taking one turn i felt like the gray went but the gray moved each of you moved it is now the greatest turn again

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** I felt like you skipped one of us because the greatest took two turns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Raise your hand.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Did everybody get a turn?

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Did I skip anybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** I feel like you skipped me, but it's cool.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** Good.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Wait, I feel like you did not skip you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Rolu walked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Wait.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, but I also remember you being like, okay, it's her turn.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** And then that's her turn.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** And then we were all like, oh, that's creepy.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** And then now you're like, oh, it's her turn again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Oh, I did skip Rolu.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** You're right.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** I'm sorry.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Rolu, go ahead.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:31]** Well, don't tell me what to do.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** So can I do... What would work better to understand this spell?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:42]** Because having heard the door open and not being able to see anything, is it better to detect magic?

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** It must be a magical darkness is what Rollo's thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:52]** Or can I do a mysticism to know... You could do a mysticism to try to understand it or you could do detect magic to sense it.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Yeah, better to understand it, I think, in this case.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:01]** So that's going to be a 20 again on mysticism.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:06]** To understand, like, what are the extents of this darkness?

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:12]** Because we just heard the door open and there was this huge engine that was on, casting light, and now we can't see anything.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Right.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:36]** um so you are you you realize now that you are in a cloud of create darkness is the spell so it is a magical darkness that expands for a certain radius and you are in within it and so you are completely blinded until you are out of it or it is dispelled it's a pretty wide radius clarifying question do we still hear the thrum of this engine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:36 - 00:49:02]** it's louder now that you open the door yeah the sound of that thrumming never got it yeah so like the expect the expectation is that we would see the glow but we don't and so we i think all of our characters would probably recognize that this is a magical darkness and not a natural darkness anyway sorry i'm i'm oh yeah it's true right yeah i also need to make a 42 safe right so that way against this sonic that's still going on oh we do have to we have to roll out every turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Yeah, because it's happening every turn, right, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Or do we all of us roll it at the same time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Let's just stick it on.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** We'll save that for Tremei's turn.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** I'll roll on Tremei's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Okay.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Sounds good.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:29]** Rulu doesn't see any light in there, but my thought as a player is to go to a place where there is light, because I don't know how long, because no one can dispel, and the only way that we can see what's going on is to move to a place where there's light.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** I literally don't know how far that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:48]** is kev blocked the whole map as black other than fog of war so i don't know where there's light and where there is not but we don't see actually i blocked more than fog of war like you you guys see absolutely nothing the only thing the only thing that's actually visible on your screen is that blue glow from your pocket


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Okay.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** And the door opened and we can't see the engine, right?

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** No.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Okay.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Rolu is going to move in.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** I think over this shouting, Rolu is not trusting of Treme right now.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:05]** And Treme saying, Lord, and then Treme dazzling, and then the sonic effect.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:15]** And then wanting to move all this, he puts his head down and he starts to move five feet into the room straight ahead.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:21]** And he is going to look for something in the room to, I think, look for the gray.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** I think that's what his plan is.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:29]** So I take 10 feet, stumble into the room, feeling, trying to move past.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Do I see anything, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** Let me see where you are moving to.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** You said five feet forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:44]** 10 feet forward I don't this is like a nightmare for right he's like I don't want to spoil anything but like what happens if we stumble into the drift engine I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** You get sucked into the drift.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** I don't know.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Yeah, like, we'll see.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Like, insta-dead.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** Okay, so right now, you are... If we die, we die.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Right.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** This is going to suck, but... Oh, because this hasn't sucked already?

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** No, it's going to suck for me because of the way I'm doing this on Roll20.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** But, okay, so you're now right next to Chak.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** And so you know that is where the door is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Okay.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** I can feel the aperture.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Yep.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Okay.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Will's got the waterworks just so hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** So are you moving?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** You're going to move into the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Yeah.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Okay.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** He's going to keep moving.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** He's going to take a five-foot step in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** You don't see anything yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Okay.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** He's going to take another five-foot step forward.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Okay.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** So he's 20 feet from where he was.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** He knows the room is not that big, but there's an engine somewhere in there.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:32]** So I'm presuming the sound of the engine is getting closer and closer.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** So maybe he knows where he can stop, right?

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Yeah.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:42]** Uh, so he's, I think having moved 20 feet in, he remembers there's a desk over to the left.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** So he's going to start moving over to the left.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** He's going to hold on one second.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Okay.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Okay.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:50]** So as you step, you step that, that first fight feet, you see nothing.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Yep.

**[00:51:51 - 00:52:01]** And that second five feet, it's going to be like you just like walked through Stargate or something like some kind of portal because you start to emerge from it.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** Oh, you realize like you see the wall of blackness behind you and you can't see anybody inside of it.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** And the purple glow of the drift drive starts to hit you.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Oh, wow.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:18]** And you see, this is what's, I wanted to be able to keep you guys separate.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** I actually had just a separate page that I was running.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** That's where the total darkness takes place.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** You should do that.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** So I'm moving you back.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** I can't move one character to another page.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:32]** So you guys are all going to then see the three of you outside are in darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Yeah.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** No, this is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** This is awesome.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:40]** So I'm not sure exactly what you guys are seeing, but I'm assuming the three of you cannot see into the room, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** And I can see the room.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Yeah, this is great.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** This is lovely.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** This is quality Roll20 GM work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:55]** And the gray is standing about 15 feet up and another five feet over from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Okay.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:04]** Everyone come into the room and you'll be able to see this magical darkness that this fiend has created ends at the door.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:12]** And I think Rolu is, he has his tactical spear and his serpent laser out.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:19]** And I think he's going to, I'm going to do, I'm going to pull a check and roll a wisdom save and see what Rolu does.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** I love that this is contagious.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** It's, it's, it's very contagious.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** I have a, I have a nine wisdom.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** I have a nine wisdom.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** So I don't think it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** What do you roll?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** Like, what is the, what is the, the like pass or fail for this wisdom save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:33 - 00:54:03]** the pass is that i uh the better part says that rolu should just attack and just like try and create this but then he's all part of him is curious about this creature uh so actually that raises two things one can i do a mysticism or culture to see if i know anything about graze so that's where he did that last time but just to confirm that i could learn anything not mechanical why would they be here but more about why is this creature here what like

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:19]** like i've seen the reason they are so not not like why are the grays here but why is this specific gray here uh no more in general why are like grays here like why are we seeing a gray can i like run through anything from what i know you can try roll roll a culture check

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** Okay.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Yeah.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** That's going to be, that's the worst role I've had so far.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** It's going to be a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** And, and like, you are just like racking your brain.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Like what?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:34]** Like you, you don't, you know that this is a gray, like that is the myth, the legend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:40]** You've seen it drawn in pictures and you've seen it like blurry images of it.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:49]** But you can't grasp anything of detail about what these creatures are and what they do or why they exist or what their intentions are.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** None of that makes sense.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** There's nothing in the records.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Okay.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** All right.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** I'm going to do Wizards save.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** If I fail, then I am going to ask it why it's here.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** If I succeed, I'm going to just start shooting.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** I think that's the...

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** That's the decision.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** I rolled a natural 20.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Nice.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** With a minus one.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** So Rolu, and I wish I'd used that on my attack.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:16]** Rolu is going to raise the rifle and take a shot at this gray.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** Are you going to say anything first or are you going to shoot?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** No, he's just going to shoot.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:26]** That is going to be a boom.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** Really, really strong opening salvo here with a 15 against EAC.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** And that hits.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Oh, that hits.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Oh, great.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Wow.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Maybe they're, like, physically weak, hopefully.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Wow.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Okay.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** 11 points of fire damage from this azimuth serpent laser.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Nice.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** All right.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** And that's the end of your turn?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** He says, he's not going to say anything.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** I'm just committing to the dice roll.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** The dice roll was a clear, like, roll he was going to shoot.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** So I'm going to roll with it for now.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Okay.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** That's my turn.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** So, Chalk, you're up.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Oh, no, sorry.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** That was going back and giving Rolu his turn back.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** It is now the gray's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:13]** And so the gray is going to look at Rolu after taking that hit from almost the back because she was walking away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** Oh, you didn't say that.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** It just has it looking at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** I mean, it's a token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** Right, you just didn't say anything.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:26]** So in my head, in my theater of the mind, I had it looking at me like walking towards me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** When she sees you come to the room, she turns, you took a shot.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:37]** So she turns back and now she's facing full on and she's gonna, there's this little, you notice like the blackness behind you.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:43]** You realize that there's a little mote of blackness floating over and around her, swirling.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:48]** She kind of just puts her hand flat and that mote settles in her hand.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:56]** And then there is an aura of solid darkness that just slams into you.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Let's see, though.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Let's see what it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** I don't know what this is.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Am I going to be... Yeah, that's wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Does a 13 to EAC hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** 13 to EAC.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** It's going to be a big old nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:15]** Okay, so it hits you, but it just kind of fades away and blends in with the darkness behind you.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Just...

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:26]** Uh, and then she's going to just, she's going to dart and use the rest of her move action to race for that computer in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Okay.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** She's trying to get to a computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** She gets to that computer where she was standing.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:34]** Originally Rose now in that door, there's a wall of darkness behind her.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Uh, Chuck, sorry.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** Yeah.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Chuck, now it is your turn.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** What are you doing?

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Chuck is going to wait.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** No, sorry.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Yep.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Roll.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** You killing me on this.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** It was the gray's turn.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Now it's Treme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** That's what I thought.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** So I'm going to go.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** I'm stumbling through.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** Hey, is this thing open?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I hear something going on back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:01]** I'm going to step through the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Okay.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** So you move up that far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** Well, I can't move any further for whatever reason.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** It's blocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Okay.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** So you are moving further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Yeah, I'm trying to.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Yeah.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** I want to get into the room.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** Okay, so I moved you through the barrier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** This traitor.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:21]** And I sort of wink at Roller.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** I hope Roland notices, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:30]** Give me a sleight of hand check for that, or is there another... Yeah, a sleight of hand, it's fine.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Stealth?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Is it a bluff?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Or be it stealth, because he's trying to hide it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** To be fair to... Yeah, does Tremé know that he's a traitor, though?

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** I don't know if Tremé was keyed in on it, I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:45]** I thought it was just Shaq and I. Yeah, you pretty much... Thaddeus pretty much said everything he could to these two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Oh, that's right, yeah, my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:51]** I have no... I've got nothing with this traitor.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Great.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** What should I call you?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:58]** You don't have a name, but... My name is Mousyox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Mousyox!

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Nice to meet you!

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Oh my goodness!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** It's been so long!

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** And I rolled a 25... Actually, no.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** I rolled an 1828.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** On my bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:16]** I was going to roll it and see if I could perceive it, but yeah, okay.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** The past secret message.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** Not even worth trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:27]** I'm just giving the sort of clue to Rolu that I'm pretending to be a useful idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:36]** I think it makes sense too, Kev, that this creature is running away towards the computer and hears this and doesn't, you know, didn't see it.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:40]** I was going to ask, does everyone hear that or does only...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Oh, it's in all of your heads.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:45]** She's taking no effort to talk to you guys individually.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** Got it.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** I still have a turn, don't I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** Is that diplomacy check?

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Or is it just a bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:55]** Yeah, it was just a bluff as I walk into the room to tell Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** Okay, I guess you get a standard action or a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** Oh, I was going to cast Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** On who?

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:02]** The gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:06]** I feel like that really defeats your purpose of doing a bluff check, then, if you're going to run attack.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** It's all good.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** All right, go for it.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Do Magic Missile.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Go for it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** I disagree.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:18]** I think the bluff was good overall for her and for me, because in Rolu's mind, Rolu was also so like, I don't know what's going to go on with Tremayne.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Can I retcon it?

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:28]** I'm just going to do the Infinite Worlds again and save my thing, and I'll just do like a...

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** Another envir... No.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** How many spell slots do you have?

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** I have four.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Okay.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:42]** Okay, I'm going to cause an instantaneous destabilizing event, and there's going to be a split-second reversal of gravity.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Okay.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** That's so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Also, do we need to roll for the fortitude?

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Yes, we do.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** Is that only if you're still in that room, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:56]** No, it was 115 feet plus 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** Everybody roll for the original sonic blast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** The sonic is still going on.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** What was the DC for that?

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** This is the second round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** What was the DC for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** Okay, so I pass this time, so I do not take the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Rolo failed.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** He takes half damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** You can't half the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** So it's a one minimum one.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** So everyone takes one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** So everybody takes one anyway.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** It doesn't matter if you pass or fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** It doesn't matter if you pass or fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** Okay.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** All right.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Jeez.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** That's 130 foot radius for my... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** So what are you doing now?

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** What is the next thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:40]** So I'm causing a split second reversal of gravity and each creature within 130 feet must now succeed at a reflex save or be knocked prone.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:42 - 01:02:01]** uh and if a creature rolls a natural one it's saving throw it is also moved five feet per level of the spell slot expended which would be one so five so the gray failed okay rolu what's the dc 14 14 i fail but am i going to be affected in this other room

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** You're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** Roller succeeds.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** What's the range again, Will?

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** 130 feet.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Okay.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Outside of the room, too, right?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Like, I've just checked.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** So, who all fail?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Roller, you failed?

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** No.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:16]** Roller succeeded.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** Fatty has failed, so he's prone.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Jack succeeded.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** For three turns, is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** No, this is just an instant thing.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** This one is instant.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** The other one was environmental.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** That takes multiple rounds.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:34]** This is just a quick... You know, Termi, I don't know what you're doing, but could you do something else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:57]** just saying it's so cool it's so cool is it is it is that you were really saying that that's that's john saying that like this like this game is just rad we ran out of darkness into a pre-drift engine with a fucking gray and there's like a sonic boom and gravity's reversed it's just cool it is cool but fatty is not happy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** He's in line with being a cat.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:04]** He's really upset about the gravity not working.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]** If you've ever seen those videos of cats in space, they're not happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:17]** Chuck, hearing the blaster fire and feeling the reversal of gravity knows that the excrement has hit the air circulation device.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Okay.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** And he's going to rush in like a fool.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Get it?

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Because fools rush in.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Fools rush in.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:30]** Okay, so let me put you on the other side.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** What a visual this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** I know, dude.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:37]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** It's so cool.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Describe it.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** What are you guys seeing on the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:48]** Front and center is this gigantic drift engine, which is comedic.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:53]** It reminds me of, at the beginning of Guardians 2, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.

**[01:03:53 - 01:04:00]** 2, the big monster that was trying to steal the batteries, but it yawns in technicolor rainbow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** It's that, but it's that pulsating from the center of this map.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:20]** And then off to the left is some sort of computer screen with a skeletal being with giant black eyes staring at us into like Chuck's soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:29]** And also, everywhere except for the drift engine is mostly grayscale, except for a few odds and ends that are debris.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:34]** But the engine is clearly the color focus, and it's just a cool map.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** It's a really neat map.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:39]** Also, Kev, why does the gray have the little symbol being bent over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** That's the prone.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:41]** I'm using that as the prone.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** So the gray and Thaddeus are both knocked prone.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]** Chuck, are you doing anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:56]** Chalk is going to step through Thaddeus, excuse me, through Termaidan, and you know what?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Screw it.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** He's going to take a shot.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** At Rolu?

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Great.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** In due time, in due time.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:07]** So, like, Chalk glances over his shoulder at Rolu, but is like, no.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** That's too close.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** There would be an AOL.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Oh, actually, nope.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:18]** He's not going to take a shot because I just checked the range on my light fastfall blaster and it is 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** You could take a penalty for anything past that.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** So you'd only take a minus two penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** You would love that, wouldn't you, Kev?

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** I'm just saying.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** It's only two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:29]** It's only minus two for every full length past.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** So, like, it's 20 feet.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:34]** So, anywhere between 20 and 40 would be minus two.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** 40 and 60 would be minus two.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Sure.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** I'll fire it.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** And she's on the ground.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:38]** I forgot.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Oh, she takes advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** She gets plus two to her AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:45]** And that is a six to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** That does not hit.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:48]** So you just wild to shoot at her.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** So Thaddeus is prone.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** So he's like going to crawl forward and he's thinking his head.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** He's an idiot.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:58]** And then he just like crawls through the threshold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** Before you do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** This is something I hate so much about Starfighter.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** We talked about this.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]** If you are prone, you can only move five feet for one full movement action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:10]** That's enough to get in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** Uh, no, actually it's not, but okay.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** So are you serious?

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:17]** You kind of have an option of like you either crawl or you stand up and move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:21]** But standing up and moving is a move action, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** So standing up is a move action.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:26]** Moving would be a second move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:26]** Right.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Yeah, I know.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** Yeah, I got you.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:33]** So, I mean, like literally on the other side of this door is the room.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** I'm five feet away from the other side of the door.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Does that not get me into the room?

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** It looks like I'm right on the threshold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:44]** It will get you... It's in through the doorway, but you're still within the threshold of darkness.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:46]** But you wouldn't even know that, because you're in the darkness.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** But I'm telling you that from a metagame perspective.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Five feet's not going to do it.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** So you could take the second five feet.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:58]** The only problem is that Thaddeus is there, so you could do... You'd technically go up and to the right of Thaddeus, and you'd be in the room, but you're still going to be prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:59 - 01:06:59]** To the right of who?

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:00]** Termay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Termay, sorry.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** All these T names, and I'm...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** I just want to get in there and see things.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** So you're going to crawl your way in?

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** I'm going to crawl.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:10]** I'm going to take a full thing to just crawl my ass in.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:13]** I think I want to stay prone, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:13]** All right.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** So I'll put you right there.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** You're now in the room.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:17]** There's a wall of darkness behind all of you.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** Oh, my God.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:21]** So just for the listener, they're standing in the laboratory.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:25]** Top of the room in the center is the drift drive.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** The gray is about 10 feet to the left of that thing.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:52]** uh chalk is one square up from everybody else yeah he's the vanguard in front uh and then the three of them are like flat horizontally against the the door and like they are right up against the blackness the darkness behind them it is now malziox's turn she is going to stand up and reach for the computer and just hit enter


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** Okay.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:54]** What?

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** What does that mean?

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** Kev, what does that mean?

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:56]** I was trying to prevent that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:58]** And you hear her muttering to herself in her head.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:00]** She's not even trying to hide it.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:03]** She's just like, no, it's not ready.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** But I need that gem.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** I hope this works.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** And the drift drive hums to life.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** It starts to flicker and flash.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:14]** A beam of purple energy shoots up to the ceiling.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:17]** It's almost like there's a glass tube.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** What?

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:20]** With a fantastic array of purples, pinks, and blues.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:26]** If you look closely, you can actually see the strange objects in the distance inside this thing.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** It's parts of buildings, maybe even a whole city.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:30]** What?

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:34]** It's as if this beam is a window into the drift itself.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** What?

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** You see the whole thing go red.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** Let me move this one down.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:39]** It turns.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:54]** And then it shatters, leaving a glowing nebulous of purple and pink drift clouds crackling with bolts of blue.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:58]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** That's the punchline I was waiting for.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** Oh, boy.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** Look.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** Wow.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:09]** From a tactical perspective, bonus points to Kev for driving us into this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** Yeah, I know, right?

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Yeah.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:18]** Oh, this drift engine shattering is going to just, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:22]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:29]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
