**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:31]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** I am Bernice, and this is Unknown Treasures.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Oh, whoops.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:13]** Was that about Vinny now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Thank you, Bernice.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** I appreciate it.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** I'm Kevin, as you heard.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** Cheers, Bernice.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:21]** This is We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** This is episode 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** I know.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Episode 25.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** We're a quarter of 100 episodes through, which it'll probably be 100 episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** It'll probably be 100 episodes.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** We're a quarter of the way through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** We're a quarter of the way through this entire season.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** We're making good progress through part two.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** I think we can get this done by Christmas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Make sure to take small sips when I speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** This is Bernice the robot.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Well, or Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:49]** You're stuck with me for probably a full year is what I'm going to say.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Oh, wow.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** That's my estimate.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Sorry.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** I apologize.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** I'm trying to get through this as fast as I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** It's going to be great.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Is it our fault?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Because we're just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:02]** I'm not going to say I'm the only guilty party involved.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** I'm not going to say I'm innocent either.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:12]** So I've definitely added some fights that you guys were like, we're going to take four episodes to show Kevin he's bad at making fights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:19]** He says that as he's prepared a giant fight scenario for us with thousands of enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** I've worked really hard on this next map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** Maybe if you gave us less enemies to fight, we wouldn't have to fight for so long.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Just make it easier, Kevin.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** It'll go faster.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** We're basically playing legendary on Halo status.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** We pretty much are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:43]** I'm beginning to think that he fudged my ability to equip the force field armor because he made this scenario so hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:57]** I thought we were going to tell the people at home that we did that thanks Will throw me under the bus wait see if I ever help you again well okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** All right, and with that, I'm the GM now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** It's been nice playing with you guys.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:15]** Dude, when John took over, it was kind of like that one time where Bill Clinton, just for some reason, took over one of Obama's press conferences and just talked for an hour with everybody asking him questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:23]** I don't know how you got all of that from like three seconds, but I'm proud of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:26]** John said literally a breath's worth of,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** That wasn't what I was channeling, but good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** Thanks, John, for being the Bill Clinton to my Obama.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Oh, there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:44]** I need a longer headphone cable.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:48]** I think they're both great speakers, both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:53]** Are we talking about Kevin and John or Barack and Obama and Clinton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Kevin and John are... What's the difference?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Same picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** They're totally different.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** As far as GMs go, these are both good GMs.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** That's true.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Kevin and John both.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** Although Kevin's kind of too hard, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Oh, too hard.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** You hear that, listeners?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** I'm not soft.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** I'm hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** He gets really hard all the time.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** There's a reason none of our sessions go longer than four hours.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Because he's like, I'm too hard now.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I got to get soft.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Just give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** That's right.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** I'm like a sleep number bed.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** You can adjust me as necessary.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Can we?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** It's never the number you want it to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** Can we adjust it out of this joke, Kev?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** You're the sleep number bed of hell.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** John, stop trying to GM instead of Kevin.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Good lord.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Sorry, I'm trying to get hard too, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** It's hard too.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** I don't know.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** Sleep number is like a number of 100, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** I think it goes from like 10 to 100.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** It sounds really cool.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** You can adjust.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** But you can adjust.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I don't know.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** I don't have one.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** I want a water bed.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** It's just a fancy air mattress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** You want a water bed?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** They're horrible.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** I know, but they seem interesting.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** You can jump on them when you're a kid.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** It's kind of fun.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Okay, licorice pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** Go back in time and jump on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Jump on it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:23]** I'm sad that kids these days don't know what waterbeds are because they're kind of extinct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** What?

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** As they should be.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** You're right.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** As they should be.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** To be fair, they're very uncomfortable as a grown adult.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** They were all the rage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Back in the 70s.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** I don't know.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Kelly, don't you have a story about one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** What?

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** About a waterbed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** No.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** Are you saying that I should or that I have actually?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:49]** I thought you actually had one, not in like America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** I haven't heard this story.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:58]** Does this happen at your little... We'll say exclude Kevin party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** I stay in a waterbed every night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:06]** Okay, so basically, Vinny was in town, and we went to Korean barbecue at, I think, Parks, right?

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Is that right?

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Very nice Korean barbecue place.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** First time Vinny tried Korean barbecue spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** I still have no idea what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** I was fairly well lubricated for that experience.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Yeah, it was a good time.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** And it was great to have him in town.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** And Aria, all of us were there except for Kevin.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:26]** And Ariel and Carissa, who are John and Will's respective partners.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:34]** Anyway, long story short, we were talking about they were recounting an event they had in Korea where they stayed at like...

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** A quote business hotel.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:46]** But in Asia, those really are like love hotels where you basically rent by the hour or sometimes all night at a discounted rate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:50]** And you just take your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:55]** Businessmen might go there with someone that they just want to... A lady of the night.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:04]** Without getting into too much detail, when I was working in Japan, I took someone to one of those.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** But this particular one was kind of dope.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** It was huge.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** It had a sauna.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** It had a gaming room.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:18]** It had a bunch of different things, including a water slide.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** And a pool.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** A water slide, not a water bed.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** And the water slide actually was, was like a proper water slide.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** It was like one of those circular ones and stuff.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** Like it was actually a bit of an experience when you were going down.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** In your room?

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:34]** In the, in the, it was like a penthouse style, like love hotel thing, which was not as, anyway.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** So.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** And the pool was actually reasonably sized too.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** But this, it was such an opening.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:45]** It was almost like, I can't even explain it.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Anyway, it was about two stories tall, this room.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** Did you love the slide?

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Oh, I did.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** I loved it so hard.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Was it by the hour?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** Yeah, no, you can get it by the night, too.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** Like, yeah, so I got it for the night.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Nice.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** That was a baller.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:04]** It was the equivalent of you going to Indiana and getting that sweet that you got or whatever it was.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I was just like, f*** it.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** So, we water slid a lot.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** Okay, so moral of the story is when you go to Asia, please go to a love hotel.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:13]** Hang on.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** All the love hotels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** Does water slid mean what we think it means?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** Or are you literally talking about the water slide?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** It's like coloring, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:25]** Okay, no, it's a euphemism, but no, it's also literally a water slide.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** There was literally a water slide in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** He slid in on the water slide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** And a jacuzzi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** Ooh, that's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:36]** It is kind of gross if you think about it, that that's the express use of that room.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:42]** But please, if you go to Japan or Korea, well, I don't know about Korea, but in Japan, they're all themed in a special way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:46]** Can you Google Love Hotel and this is what pops up?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** You can Google Love Hotel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:56]** I'm sure you can find plenty of things to, I mean, I would definitely put safe search on, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Where are you going to go with that sentence, Will?

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** I was wondering where we were going to land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:07]** Just look at... You'll see how crazy they look if you just... Look, there's... There's one... I'm looking at, like, one hotel thing right now.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** It's, like, literally... I'm ready to move on.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** It looks like a castle inside.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** It's, like, a chariot.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** It's, like, a nightmare.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Man, I love this hotel.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** There's one with a carousel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** That must be why they're called love hotels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** Oh, my God.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** One is, like, Mickey Mouse themed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** They're getting a five-star review on Yelp.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** That's why they're love hotels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** There's a YouTube video about owning a love hotel.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** And I think I just saw, I went to a Japanese love hotel with a water slide on YouTube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Oh, okay.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** That might, I don't know if that's the same place or not.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** I've been there.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** That was the one.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** Check it out.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Oh, there's like a prison themed one.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** There's one.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Oh my God.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** It looks like space.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:54]** So I, I wasn't going to go into this, but like, uh, I guess we can real quick since you wasted all my time with love hotels.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** Um, no, it's really fun.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** Um, I just want to go around.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** to each of your characters since Thanksgiving is, I think, tomorrow.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Love us and leave a five-star review.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:11]** Why was that not our first thing that we talked about?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Because I got sidetracked with Love Hotels.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:20]** Okay, so I want each of your characters just real quick tell me what you're going to bring to Thanksgiving.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Rolu, go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Tea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** You're bringing tea.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** You're just bringing a jug of tea to Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** What more do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** God dang it, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** You're so lame.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:57]** Thaddeus you're next oh shoot I shouldn't have said anything two things or just one thing or three things maybe okay so Thaddeus I got these coupons for love hotels Thaddeus will bring his creme brulee and also I think this Thanksgiving in particular like because we killed these Kaffaks they'll probably make some kind of recipe out of them like a pie like a meat pie like a savory one you know

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:02]** like the Brits do, but hopefully it'll be better than British food, actually.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Amazing.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** Or not amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** All right, Choc, what do you got going on?

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** What did you bring in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:13]** I feel like Choc would bring a boxed mashed potato, but he wouldn't make it.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** He would bring the box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Straight from KFC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:29]** He's got enough charisma to understand there's an expectation that he would bring something to Thanksgiving dinner, but he doesn't have enough life experience to know that he should cook it before he brings it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** That's exactly it.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:43]** I do have to say that we recently, my son transitioned to a different school, and we had a going-away party for him at the last daycare, and somebody brought Popeyes, like a full thing of Popeyes, which is awesome.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Popeyes, chicken, cakes, everything.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:48]** Popeye's macaroni and cheese is phenomenal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Okay, how do we get sponsored by Popeye's?

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** I would eat a drumstick on stream every f***ing time.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Actually, I'm really down for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** I really like the Blackened Ranch.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** So tasty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** If you are listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Even their seafood is dope.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** I haven't had their seafood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** Popeyes, we'll talk to you later about this.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Our people will talk to their people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:20]** I would probably go for some spicy whipped sweet potatoes.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:25]** And spicy Nashville hot pumpkin pie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Nashville hot pumpkin pie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:33]** Look, I just looked up spicy Thanksgiving food on Google, and that's what I found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Really good right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Sounds really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** I want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** Also, can I just say I appreciated the moment when Vinny said, yeah, I'll just bring some mashed potatoes right in the box.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** And Kev finished his sentence and said, oh, yeah, right from KFC.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:53]** And I was like, is that where you think mashed potatoes come from, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:57]** I'm pretty sure that's where mashed potatoes are grown and made into mashed potatoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Vinny's bringing stuff in a box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** I have a hard time.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** I can't support bringing KFC anything, though.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** And this is why.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:10]** KFC retired their potato wedges from the U.S.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Did they?

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** Which was the last location to have potato wedges.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** And I can't... Crime against humanity.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** I can't support KFC after that.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** No.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** I'm serious.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Why would you?

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** They were the best side in fast food, period.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** There it is.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** That's it.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** I don't know about that.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Please prove me wrong.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** This is me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:38]** I'm embarrassed to say this, and I'm glad my family doesn't listen to this.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:48]** My family is terrible at cooking, especially for Thanksgiving, and I don't really enjoy Thanksgiving for that reason, but they bring KFC's gravy.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:53]** They'll actually go to KFC on Thanksgiving and buy the gravy there instead of making their own gravy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** Are they terrible at cooking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Yes.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:01]** And they're almost self-aware enough to go to KFC and buy the gravy.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** I mean, I kind of respect that.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** They want to admit that they're terrible at cooking?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** I don't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:10]** Kev, I think we need to have a Will Say Thanksgiving and give you a proper Thanksgiving.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I think, yeah.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I'm totally in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** We're going to f*** around and have a Thanksgiving, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** Yeah.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** You know I like good food.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** We should celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** When is Canadian Thanksgiving?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** I think it's already passed.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** It's October, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Yeah, it's October.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** It's already passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Quote, unquote, passed.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** But maybe we can travel back in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** I love Canadian Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Because I get two Thanksgivings.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:46]** I'm torn on Thanksgiving, so I just got a Traeger, one of the pellet smokers, and I'm torn whether to, like...

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:53]** whether to smoke a turkey or to roast it in the oven like I do every year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** I did do a turducken one year, which turned out absolutely fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** I would do smoked turkey.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Oh, man.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Why not both?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:05]** Because there aren't enough humans to eat all that turkey in my house on Thanksgiving.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:05]** Make a friend.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Yeah.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** That's the thing.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:15]** You guys, assuming Florida is still here after Ian passes through, you guys should come pull up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Ian passed through months ago.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** You're right.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:23]** Time traveling and all that fun stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** You may or may not see videos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:29]** I think it's time to get us redirected and let's focus.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** All right.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:33]** Yeah.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Food talk later.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** Save it.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** All right.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** So last time you looted the bodies of the Kestis that you murdered in cold blood.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** And then you focused on Varya 13...

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** They were absolutely lost.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** They just had no idea where to move next.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:55]** And the transponder that they focused on brought you all to this point.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** But it wasn't exactly the Stellar Flare.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:01]** Chalk noticed that it was just another escape pod from the Stellar Flare.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:07]** And Rolu pulled out a broken case that had a cylindrical cut out of dense foam.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Whatever was in there is gone.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** And you find some refrigerator tracks.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:25]** And you also figure out that you can narrow down your search for the stellar flare itself using some triangulation and math, you know, because we all love math.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** But you guys chose to follow the tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Math rocks.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Math rocks.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** Then you got hit by a heat wave marching through the desert.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** Remind me, which one of you guys are fatigued from the heat wave?

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Everyone but Thaddeus.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** That's right.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** We have Chuck and Roland.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:44]** Oh, wait.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Good thing we raised our hands.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Did Treme have it on?

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** I passed.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Treme passed the check.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Because he can withstand heat a little better than the rest of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** I'm very fond of the heat, actually.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** My, you know.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** My temperament is for that, actually.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** That's why your voice always sounds dry.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** Yeah, I'm a little dry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** Are you like a little ashy?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** I'm a little verklempt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** He keeps a frog down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:21]** We ended with Thaddeus and Chak moving forward to listen to the voices that turned out to be an Akeshi and a Space Goblin kind of arguing about something.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** But then Rolly was like, hold on, let me listen in and tripped over something and alerted Sagan.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** What?

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Yep.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:35]** And then the goblin spoke up and said, Are you guys coming for the Great Wreck?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** I think that's the voice that I used for it.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** If not, that's the voice I'm currently using.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** That's pretty good.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** It's a consistent space goblin voice.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yeah, thank you.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** That's good.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** I have a lot more space goblin voices to make in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** Yeah, we're here for the Great Wreck.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** We're drunk tourists, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** We're drunk tourists?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** We are looking for junk to trade.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Well, kind of.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** I mean, personally, I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:02]** Mark, I'm not sure that we should be talking to these folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** What do you mean?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** They seem real nice.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Come close.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** Come hang out.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** You guys want to talk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Thank you so much for this hospitality.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Come on.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Come on, guys.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** You guys seem like really cool guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** I'm not a guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** You seem like a pretty cool goblin and a cashier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I am definitely a goblin.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Yeah, goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:31]** Goblins are the funnest in space, they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:37]** I don't mean to be rude about it, but like, who are y'all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** We're certainly not pirates.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Definitely not.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** We don't like pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Very corporate.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Definitely pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** My name is Olu.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** Or the fun-loving kind like you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:58]** My name is Thassius.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** What's your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** My name is Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Hi, Jack.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** My name is Kesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** My name is Merc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Hey, Kesh.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Hey, Merc.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** So how is your search going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** What'd you guys find?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** What search?

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** They kind of like hunker down and get real tight about it.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** They're very concerned about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** What's that chest you got there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** That's nothing.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** This is nothing.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:28]** This is our... You guys spawn on us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:31]** No, we just walked up and you guys were really, really loud.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** We love surprises.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** I love some hot gossip.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Yeah, you were pretty loud.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** It's a hot day.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** We like the gossip.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Yeah, it's a hot day.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** We're just trying to rest.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** Hey, your business is your own, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Oh, it looks like we have a new map to explore.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:49]** I did just drop you onto the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Dude, that was a secret drop, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** Oh, look at secret drop.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:04]** So as you can see, the five of you, because you still have Vahri with you, are off to the left-hand side of this map.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** And to the north, there is a tent.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:12]** And there is a space goblin and an Akechdi.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Akechdi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Is this your guys' tent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** Yes, that's our current residence.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** Can I do a culture check on the Great Wreck?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** What do you mean the Great Wreck?

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** You want to do a culture check or you just want to ask them about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:37]** No, I want to do a culture check for me and see if I know what that... It's like Great Wreck capital G capital W is what it feels like.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yes.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** Yeah, so I want to just do a culture check, try and remember.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Is that cool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Yes.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Go ahead and roll me a culture type.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** 15.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** 15.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** All right.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Anybody else know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** I'm going to put Thaddeus up a little closer.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** With a culture check?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** I can check my thing.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:09]** Yeah, you just assume that this is some wreckage of something that is considered significant to the area.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Other than that, you don't know much more than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** That's an 18 culture check from check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:24]** Chalk has a hinkling that they might be referring to something greater than just... The greater wreck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Can we do a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** The really great wreck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** When you use the word to define the word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:39]** You come to realize that the great wreck that they're referring to is the stellar flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** We've been looking for the great wreck.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Oh, are you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** There are so many spoils for us all.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Why couldn't we all share in them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** What do you mean by spoils?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** You know, pictures of the Great Wreck and postcards and, you know, just a good old time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** Good old trinkets to find inside.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** It's understood to be a spot where there's a lot of people waiting for photos.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:13]** It's a very popular, you know, infosphere media spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** More of a pilgrimage than spoils, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Yeah, he's kind of religious, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:24]** I definitely have to say that you all have no idea what you're talking about.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:27]** This is a very sacred ground to many folk.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** You got us.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** Yeah, this is actually the Great Wreck.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** It is the coming of Triune.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** It is the temple.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** At least that's what the other goblins think.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** I'm not really sure I believe in that kind of stuff.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** The coming of Triune?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** The Great Wreck in the Sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** Just because I put my arms up didn't mean I was pointing to the sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** You're right.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** We don't... Jack, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** The coming of Triune?

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** Like, when the Drift was established?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** What are we talking about here?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** So, let me just...

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Back up a little bit.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:13]** Merc and Kesh are standing close enough to the great wreck that you can actually see in the background.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:20]** And you see the wreckage of a massed ship that looms beyond an empty battlefield.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:29]** The ground, though still dry, still sports blood stains and the occasional bleached bones poke out from the silt.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:33]** Small piles of useless machinery scraps dot the area.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:42]** A low thrum emanates from the starship, and a spark of air and electricity occasionally flies through the hole.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:49]** One of the vessel's airlocks is still intact, lies nearly flush with the ground.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:56]** The doors seemingly glow with a reddish-purple hue, and it seems to crackle on occasion.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Is it behind them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** That's when you realize there's actually a force field over this door.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:11]** And so, yes, what you were pointing at and circling is the airlock to the Great Wreck, also known as the Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:18]** Okay, so what we establish is they are between us and... So go ahead and kill them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Go for it.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Kevin, how dare you assume that?

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** How dare you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** You're right.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** You got us.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:34]** We have heard about something here that was of interest, but we don't know a lot about the Great Wreck.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:39]** It's good to meet somebody who is as informed as you two.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Could you tell us more about it?

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** How special is this place?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** He's looking at Mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** I'd like to work on changing.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** I feel like we've been flattering them.

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:00]** And so I feel like changing their attitude over this few minutes plus whatever many more minutes it might take.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** Can we roll a couple of diplomacy checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** You can try.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** They seem pretty friendly already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, but I want them to be helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Go ahead and roll me a diplomacy check.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** Can I also roll one as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Assist.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** 30-something.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** All right, Barack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Yep, I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Are you Barack or Bill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** 30.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** Tell me what you say to them to be... Well, we've been doing this.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** Yeah, that's everything we've said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:37]** I mean, we've been absolutely positively affecting the creature's attitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** Rolo was trying to engage them and defer and be like, oh.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** I even called them very wise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:47]** I'm going to actually move all of you up real close to them then.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** What?

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** I didn't want to.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** If you guys are going to get this friendly.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** Okay, okay.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Chalk, you're staying on top of.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** You guys can move yourselves a little bit.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I'll give you one free move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:01]** The one free move.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:05]** I'm fine because I don't want to step on somebody else's toes.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:06]** It's fine.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** I think we're fine right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** So what do they say?

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** Okay, so you did ask about the Great Wreck.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:16]** And what they tell you is that essentially the Great Wreck, it's existed since beyond time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Time immemorial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** At least time as they understand it.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:24]** And mind you that these creatures, their lifespans are a lot shorter than...

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:28]** you know, regular humans or other characters.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:33]** So, uh, so a lifetime to them is twice as short as others.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Do you guys want to ask them anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:40]** Uh, do you guys ever venture inside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** Oh, that's actually what we're trying to do.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Oh.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:55]** So you see that this here wreck is a sacred place to many people in the outer junk fields.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** Our thoughts is if we can get in there, that we might be able to leverage that.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:07]** And they explain that if they can get inside, they can maybe discover whatever it is about this place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** That is so patron-worthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:17]** Exactly, that they can actually use it to unite and prevent further fighting between the Kestis and the Gotham.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** Man, you guys are pretty amazing.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** Why don't we help you?

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** Yeah, why don't we do this together?

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** We can all be united under one banner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** You guys are cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** Your guys are cute too, man.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** They're great.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Especially since Isakeshi's like a pink one.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Look at him.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** He's kind of sad looking too.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Yeah.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** He's got a lot of wham.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** I mean, they're trying to work through their differences.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** He's like a depressed snake.

**[00:27:46 - 00:28:01]** Can Rolu walk over or at least just look and kind of do an engineering check or a perception check to see on the force field on the threshold into the ship?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** Yeah, go ahead and roll me an engineering check.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** I'll assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** The voice in the sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** And I am successful in assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** There it is.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** I got a total 19.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** That's a 21 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:18]** All right, so you know for a fact that these four fields are not to be messed with.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** It'll take something immensely powerful to take down these fields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Like maybe some C4 from our friend Shaq.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:31]** And if you ask them... What have you tried?

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** All right.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** I haven't tried.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** I have a plan.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** I do.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** I have a great plan.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** Yeah, she's actually got a great idea.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** That's why I'm... It's one of the things that I really like about her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Wait, are you guys a couple or something?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Oh, no, no, I'm not.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Oh, unrequited love, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:54]** And he kind of blushes, and she didn't even catch what you said, and she just keeps rambling on.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** So the trash hunters one time, they almost made it in.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:02]** They had pulse rifles, and they had MP grenades, and they're like,

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** But it wasn't enough.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** It just didn't.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** But I have my plan, my idea.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** I have this EMP key.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** It's so much better.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** So much better.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:23]** So Merc thinks that she could create this device that tunes into the resonance frequency of the force fields.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:30]** She does her best to explain the science to you, but her stilted grammar and her tendency to go on tangents makes it really difficult to follow.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Go ahead, roll me a physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:39]** I really want to establish, Jack is such a fan of the space goblin right now.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:49]** Like, as an agent of chaos, a concentrated EMP blast is like, he's a kid in a candy store and she's Willy Wonka.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** Yeah.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Is this a love triangle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Maybe.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** Chalk's going to kill Cash just out of... God, you're so dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Choke him in his sleep.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** My God.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** Kev really wants something to die right now.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** His brain, like, goes there.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Like, he can't help it.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** He's such a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** I'm just following your guys' train of thought.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Lizards in the back, that's all.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** The projection is incredible.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** Can I get that physical science check?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** I can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** We're not trained.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** We've established this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** I'll give you a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Okay.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** To a D20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Alright, roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** We'll do it.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Twelve, do it.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** That's an 18 on the die.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** I got 16.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Will a 16 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** so I think you're just going to nod ahead.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:40]** Like you have no idea what she's talking about, but like you have a sense that she does.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** Um, and so in that sense that you could trust her.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Yeah.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Okay.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Okay.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** Go ahead and give me a culture check on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** Something I'm actually trained in, but I rolled crap.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** 12.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Ooh.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Yeah.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I did not roll well either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Hmm.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Dirty 20.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Dirty 20?

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** Chak.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** Chak is so interested.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** He's paid attention to every single bit of body language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:20]** You're just pulling from every bit of knowledge you have and you understand that space goblins have this instinctual way of building things that are almost seemingly impossible, but they manage to function at least once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Just barely, yeah.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** As we've seen in the past with our engagements with them elsewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** On other shows that you should like and subscribe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** The Threefold Conspiracy, the flagship show of Wilson's podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:38]** She's almost like mumbling to herself, like, I only need two more things to finish off my MPT.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:44]** I need to get me an electrolytic capacitor, and I need to get me a plasma circuit, charger circuits.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** I almost had that.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:49]** And then that's when Keshe speaks up.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:56]** Would ROLU know inherently if any of those components are available in devices that would be on our persons or around us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** You can either roll an engineering check or a physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:08]** I got a 20 dirty on my engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** So Tremé knows that there's no way you guys have any of that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** Looks like we'll have to search around for some parts then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** Yeah, the electrolytic capacity.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** My voice is terrible.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Need some more Dr. Pepper?

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Get some Dr. Pepper, yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** The electrolytic capacitor is in the trash hunter territory.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** That's near the shrine to Tinkerton.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:39]** That's what the goblins call the murder bot.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:44]** To believe that the murder bot was sent to us by treason.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:56]** All right, so the story goes, the Great Wreck opened up just about a decade ago, and out emerged this giant robot from a cloud of purple smoke.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** Yeah, and then the door slammed shut, and the force fields came back on, and they've been on ever since.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** Is Rick actually going to make an appearance?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** Because that would be interesting if he cameos.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Spoilers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:20]** So the shrine to Tinkerton is near the murder bot, which is what the goblins call.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Am I getting that right?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** And that's when the force field went up?

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:28]** Well, that's where the electrolytic capacitor is, near the murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:35]** What they explain is that Tinkerton is the murder bot, but the space goblins in the area, the trash hunters are called.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** So the trash hunters are the group of space goblins in this area.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:47]** And they praise this murder bot, but it's not a murder bot to them.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** It is called Tinkerton, and it was sent by Triune.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** It came from the Great Wreckage.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:56]** So this great wreckage is a temple to them, to Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Are we saying that there's a shrine to Triune somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:05]** I think there's a shrine to Tinkerton, the murderer, not Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:11]** Who they've alluded to as... They've ascribed to Triune.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Yeah.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Could we help you?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:34]** acquire these materials if you could lead us there do you have any goblin friends that could help us out or no anymore Keshti do you want to come with welcoming no I definitely don't think we would be doing that

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:37]** So we're running a fetch quest for you, basically.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** Fetch quest to open a door to go on another quest.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Sounds like a plan.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** We have to find a murder box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** Thaddeus, this is not your first time as a pirate, I hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** You shouldn't fight unnecessary battles, Gob.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** This isn't the ship.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:58]** I know it's hard for you to understand this stuff, but down here...

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** You want to avoid unnecessary battles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:08]** So Kesh told you, basically Merc told you there's two more things that she needs in order to complete this EMP key that you believe actually might work.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** There's the electrolytic capacitor and the plasma charging circuit.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:25]** And then Kesh, the Akeshti, turned around and told you that the electrolytic capacitor is probably in Trash Hunter territory around the shrine to Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:51]** Merck then tells this story basically it's a story about how Merck and Keshe became friends because it's very strange that a Keshe and a goblin especially in this part of town I'm fascinated by this they tell you the whole story is there a love hotel in the is there a love hotel in Junkers Delay is there a love hotel oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Is that why Junker's Delight is called Junker's Delight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** I think so.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Sneaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** My headcanon is... The treasure was love.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** It was love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** The treasure was love the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** The love of two races coming together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Dude, I won't judge.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** They tell you the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Standing this relationship.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** This is great.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** I'm shipping this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:17]** We became friends weeks ago after both of us ran into that murder bot.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** We were only made out because we worked together.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:29]** Oi, I was digging around at the dead end and not really paying much attention to anything.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** And that's when I came running.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** I was like, the murder bot's coming.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** The murder bot's coming.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** So we hid and we waited for it to leave.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:42]** But it stuck around because it was like looking for something.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** But it definitely found what it was looking for.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Yeah, that was like a few weeks back.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** Merc had another run in with it a few days ago.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:56]** I had the plasma charging circuit in my hands.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** When I heard that thing coming, I let it go.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** I ran.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I ran so far away.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** I ran so far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** You hid together and found yourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** I found the charging circuit, but that was different.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** That was a different time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:18]** Out of curiosity, when this thing was chasing you, did it happen to leave square-shaped prints in the sand?

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Oh, its feet are bigger than square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** It's big square feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Like a refrigerator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:30]** Yeah, well, I guess, what, two feet by two feet?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** I guess that's the average size of a refrigerator.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** Yeah, I would say they look like a refrigerator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** That's more like a mini fridge, but yes.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Definitely not a Sub-Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Maybe like a three foot by three foot?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Is that...

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** I don't know the average size.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** I'd say maybe... I live in the desert where we don't have any power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:50]** 36 inches across is about standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** That's big refrigerators.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Two of them, one on each foot.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:55]** They wear them like boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** Also depends on the power rating that you're putting inside the fridge.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** All right, everyone.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** I'm moving on.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Good Lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** Where do you think we can find this refrigerator creature?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** All right.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:11]** So Merc tells you about this plasma charging circuit and that the murder bot got it.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Oh, got it.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:17]** She thinks that the murder bot picked it up and actually merged it into his body.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:22]** And then Cash warns you about the dangers of this murder bot.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** It punches like a truck.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:28]** And it's immune to most magics.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** At this comment, Merc kind of chimes in, but what about Zethelred?

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Maybe he can help you.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:42]** And Cash tells you that Zethelred is a solitary, hard-edged Vesk who rided the outer junk fields just a couple months ago.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:47]** Both the trash hunters and the unbrewed leave him alone.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** He's so intense, says Merc.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** But he's also very nice.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:56]** And then Cash admits that he hasn't seen Zethelred for a while.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:00]** But he suggests that you might be able to find him at his camp to the west.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Near that big Vizcaran cruiser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** I think we should go find some allies first.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** What do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** Well, Zethelred is... We were just there.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** You were there?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** Yeah, we didn't see him either.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** We didn't see him either.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Discovered their camp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:25]** He might be out hunting something then.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Sure.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** Who's gone doing that stuff?

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Who are the Unbrood?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:42]** So you know that the Unbrood, from fighting those two Akestis, that the Unbrood are a group of Akestis in the Outer Junk Fields that have been shunned by their society, and they're those that are slated to rut and become Riveners.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** That's right.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Which, Kes should be one of them.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** He is probably a member of the Unbrood.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** Is there a target for who this refrigerator is hunting?

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** I don't think so.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** Well, what do you mean?

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** It's the murder bot.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** It's Tinkerton.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Right.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** He roams lands such as Triune.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** At least that's what the other goblins tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:09]** So, I mean, does he just murder anybody in sight or is he particular?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:13]** I was calling him murder bots because he murders a bunch of people.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:19]** It's not really... I mean, he's just a giant scary robot.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** I'm not sure he's been killing much lately.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** We just kind of keep away from him as much as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:32]** Well, it sounds like we need to at least go get that electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:38]** And then if we run into this murder bot, then we can maybe get this plasma charging circuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:42]** Any other clues on where that man you mentioned is?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** The one who could possibly help us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Roll me for clue check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Merck kind of tells you exactly where that last incident happened.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:57]** So Merck had the one component they needed in their hands.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** I just forgot what it was.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** The plasma charging circuit?

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:08]** The plasma charging circuit in their hands and then they heard the murder brought coming and got so scared they dropped it and ran.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** but they'll point you right in the direction of where that happened.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** What time is it?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:18]** It's going to be late to mid-afternoon, mid to late afternoon, time for 4 p.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Cobb, we should enlist the help of that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** I agree, but it sounds like he's back at nighttime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Yeah, I mean, we don't know.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** We don't know where they are, so hopefully we'll run into them.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** Do you think he returns back to his camp at night?

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** I'm sure he must go at nighttime, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** Are you guys talking about Zathorad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** Desert's too dangerous to be out at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** Didn't we see that Zathorad hadn't been there in days, though?

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:50]** So I... Doesn't support the theory that they'd come back at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:54]** All right, well, then it looks like it's straight to the death bot, then.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** I believe so.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Although, do we want to rest?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** We should take a rest.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** This spot is safe to spend the night, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** You can stay all you want.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** We have two cots that we can rotate out properly.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** God, I love these people.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:17]** I'm not quite sure we have enough room for you, but it's been pretty quiet around here lately.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** You're welcome to stay.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:22]** And Vary13 actually kind of speaks up and says like,

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:30]** I do think that I should stay with them while you guys venture out and take care of the necessary requirements for this mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Big surprise.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** I think like... Wow, thanks.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Yeah, great job.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:40]** You've been... You've been so helpful on this quest that you've put us on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:45]** That is, you've really taken a harsh tone against our companion here, I think.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Could be good to chill.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:55]** Thaddeus just takes a deep breath and nods somewhat admittedly.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** Rolu is right.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:00]** But I think Thaddeus is going to like camp out under this.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Like there's like some kind of like tent looking thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** So that is the tent.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** You just take their beds.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** Merc and Kesh have set up for themselves.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:21]** They have two cots, but there's enough room probably in the floor for you guys to make, you know, two more areas for bed and still be covered from, you know, the, the environment.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:27]** Do you mind if we stay inside your shelter, if we make room for everyone, including you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** I'm okay with that.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** All right.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:36]** So we're going to fit one, two, three, four, five, six, seven folks into a four-person tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** Rolo's actually going to camp out.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Shack is small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** I think Shack is tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** So six into a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** Merk or, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Yeah, they're small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** Plus, we're taking rotations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Well, I thought they were getting close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Do you guys want to rest up here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:08]** Okay, so I'm going to say that a long rest probably takes you 12 hours at this case, unless you want to take it eight hours, but I'm going to make you roll for fatigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** No, thanks.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I don't think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** No, thanks to what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:16]** Unless somehow you're going to throw something in those last four hours that we're sleeping.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** I kind of doubt it.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:24]** Actually, I'm not trying to bait you right now, so don't do that, but I'm just saying we're rotating watches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:31]** While you guys are sleeping, you hear refrigerators stomping in the distance.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** So you guys take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:38]** I think Shaq's top of Chico is just like the water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:43]** I was just going to narrate what Merlo was doing as we were going to sleep, but I didn't know if anyone else was going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** So beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** So beautiful.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:59]** I think as Rolu hears you all maybe talking and chattering, he's leaning up against the wreckage that's nearby.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** And I think just enjoying the fact that he can see the stars for once.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:32]** and take peace in that moment knowing that he doesn't often have a home but he is able to find one here briefly amongst some friends and he's going to pull out his communicator and he's going to send a message and it just says it might be good to start getting the things in my room ready

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Sends it off.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:51]** And then he's going to pull out a sketch pad and going to just start looking up and trying to chart different constellations in the Akiton night sky.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Classic Roliv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** It's almost too serendipitous.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** It's too coincidental.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:13]** because you send that off and almost like a reply back to it, everyone's comm units start to blink, at least the pirates, all the pirates, as you receive this message.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Wanted.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** And somebody describe this to me, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Oh my God.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** It's a wanted poster.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:30]** And it says, Wanted hears Fabricius charges breaking the oath and high treason against the pirate council.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:36]** And it's just a picture of him doing like a Cad Bane style pose with his huge hat.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** It's like Michael Jackson's Billie Jean pose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** It's accurate.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** phenomenal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** That's what it is.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** There's no reward posted on it.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** There's no reward posted, yeah, that's true.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** He's not worth much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** There's no reward to this.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:55]** This character is wanted by the free captains, simple and outright.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:00]** And as a free captain, it's your duty to hunt them down.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** But what it is, is basically each of you

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:09]** And it's almost hard to cover if you're trying to cover it up because your commune, it's on your wrist or in your hand.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** They project upward.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:18]** And so it's this bluish figure of here's with these floating words that say wanted.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** And above them is the crest of the free captains.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** So are we all awake when this happens?

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** This wakes us all up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:32]** I'll say, you know, each of you, whenever you wake up, it's definitely like a notification on top of your screen.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** Who doesn't check their phone first thing in the morning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** I mean, and we're all in this room.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:43]** Do we, I mean, not to metagame too much, but do we notice Rolou?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:47]** I mean, I think... Well, Rolou was out painting the stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, he was out sketching.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** He's probably asleep in the morning for anybody who wakes up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:57]** So I'd say you wouldn't... And I've heard this name before, right?

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:14]** I mean... So anybody who is a free captain who's... You might be a low member of a crew that doesn't care about the rest of the fleet, but if you were any kind of full-blown member of a crew, like a chief or an officer... That's not what I was asking.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** You're aware.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** You know who here's Fabrician is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** Yeah, so...

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:35]** Yeah, and on that, because Thaddeus has been on edge so much and looking for data to show where Rolu's involved, he suspects that maybe Rolu had something to do with this.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:40]** But this does wake him up because he's been kind of on edge and he hasn't been sleeping too well.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:50]** And then he just looks out of, like, the gap in this tent, and he sees, like, Rolu looking up, drawing his stupid f***ing star painting.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** And then you just see, like, these, like... His urge to kill him.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:05]** You just see in the darkness these, like, two yellow eyes that just kind of, like, the pupils narrow as he, like, stares out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Thaddeus, do you have something in your eye?

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** You could.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** You don't notice Thaddeus.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** I know.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Sorry.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** How dare you?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Well, that was f***ing cool, Kev.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Thank you.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Yeah.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** That's really well drawn, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** It's amazing.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Classic Kevin Hart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Classic Kevin Hart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** It's actually the only art I've made for this show.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** I just keep reusing it.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** So, uh, all right.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:37]** So you guys all wake up in the morning, sun's bright and shining right into the hole in the tent.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** Um, so you guys started settling down pretty close to like four o'clock.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** And so you get a full night's rest.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** All you guys are fully rejuvenated.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:52]** Um, the one thing before you guys leave is that cash tells you like, Oh yeah,

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:56]** I have to say oi before I say anything else because I'm trying to... Like space Australia.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:03]** Australian accent because John set that precedence with... All the f***ing cashier.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Yeah.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** Oi.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:06]** Oi.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** Be careful with the ombrood, he tells you.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Oh.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** They don't take kindly to trespassers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Duly noted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** As you guys head out.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Thanks, mate.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:19]** That was good.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** So Vary's going to stay back.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:25]** The four of you can head out on your mission to get those two items to help them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:35]** I would ask Kesh before we leave if there's anything that we would possibly say or do or hold.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:39]** Can we show that we're friendly to the Unbrood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:44]** You guys already ran into the Unbrood and then you murdered them in cold blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Yeah, but they don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** They didn't live to tell the tale.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Not all dead men tell no tales.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Sometimes they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, sometimes they do, but not them.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:56]** We're basically 33% friendly to the on-bird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:10]** So your two options at this point are, are you going to go straight for where the murder bot was and try to recover the charging circuit?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Or do you want to hunt down the electrolytic capacitor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** Metagame and me wants me to hunt down the electrolytic thing first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Same.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Yeah, I agree with that.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:29]** Let's go after... Before we do the big boss battle.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** Yeah, it's better to do the easier thing first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** See, I feel like the electrolytic converter via the junk construct is the big boss battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** Jack, your voice changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** All right, Jack.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:48]** Well, whatever's easiest to do first, we should maybe do.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** I wasn't paying enough attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** I feel like the electrolytic converter in the junk construct is the big boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Okay.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** So you guys want to go for the big boss?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** No.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Again, so you have two options.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** You got electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Kevin wants easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:14]** We either have to go to where the area is to find the capacitor, or we know that the plasma charging circuit is literally inside the murder bot.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** So we either go to the area or we find the murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Yes.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** So do you go to trash hunter territory or do you go to the murder bot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** Trash hunter territory, I guess first.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** These are the two items we need, right?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Why don't we go there first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:27]** I think Cobb, you had a good idea to go there first.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** That's you, by the way.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** You're the cop.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** Yeah, sounds good to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** The desert is making everyone insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Are we unfatigued?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Because we healed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:44]** Did you heal back the damage you took from the heat stroke?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Yeah.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** Then you are no longer fatigued.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Yay.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** F***ing fatigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** So as you leave camp, you guys pack up everything.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** You get prepped for the road.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:04]** You make sure Vahri is secure and that you're certain that the two of them can protect her or them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Question mark.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Yeah, we're not really sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** So you guys leave camp.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:20]** As you guys leave camp, though, the skin crawls in the back of your neck because you just get this feeling that someone is watching you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** God.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** Perception check?

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Yeah.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:30]** Go ahead and roll me a perception check.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** The hills have eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** So creepy.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** That was really creepy.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** That was really creepy.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** That was kind of amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** 21.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** Yay.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Yay.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:49]** All right, so Chalk sees shadows along the ridge.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:55]** He just recognizes there's something more than just that mountain top on the nearest hill, but that's all he sees.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** And he tries to point it out, but nobody else sees it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** Hey, guys, there's something watching us.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:07]** I don't really know that I could put it into words, but this doesn't feel right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** It's seen us already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Oh, no.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** All right, everyone.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Guns out.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** Should we... Refrigerated steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** No, I'm kidding.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** For real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** No.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** Well, let's keep our weapons close.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:26]** Make sure you turn on your environmental protections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** That's my line, but yes.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Thaddeus reloaded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:35]** Yeah, I'll put on my environmental protections, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Because we're hiking out into the desert.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** So go ahead.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** Tell me the order at which you are traveling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** I want to be at least six feet apart.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Thaddeus will take up the front again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** You got five foot options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:53]** I think Chak is still riding on Thaddeus' shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** On Thaddeus' shoulder?

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Okay, I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** If the cat will abide it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Keep Rolu back.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:08]** So the way I have you set up now is Treme, then Rolu, Thaddeus with Chak, and then Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Where do you have us set up like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Yeah, I thought Thaddeus was taking the lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Yeah, I'll take the lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Oh, Thaddeus is taking the lead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:43]** since shock is so perceptive too you could probably spot some it's true I don't think Rolu probably is it single file like this path that we're on staggered you guys go staggered if you want it's your choice single file or staggered I would go staggered formation okay staggered formation Thaddeus leading the way Rolu next then Terme and then Vahri no sorry Vahri is there Vahri is back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:48]** I don't think Rolu cares about Jack riding on Thaddeus.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:51]** Like if there is any significance to that happening, he's not.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:01]** So after about 30 minutes of travel, you can't shake that feeling that you're being watched.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:11]** And then you arrive at a tower of metal cylinders that rises 40 feet into the sky and

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** casting a long shadow across the ground like an accusing finger.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:23]** The top wobbles slightly in the breeze, but against all expectations, the spire seems stable.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:30]** Go ahead, roll me a perception or engineering.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Flip him the bird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:38]** 19 perception, 26 engineering.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** Ooh, I got a 19 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:48]** So it's composed, what this tower is composed mainly of starship power cores stacked almost like a pyramidal shape.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:54]** But starting about halfway up, the cores balance just like one on top of the other.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:58]** Seem is seemingly in defiance of gravity.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** It's like watching a Jenga tower.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** That's all the pieces on the bottom are pulled out already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Wow.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** So go ahead.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** Uh, roll me one more perception check.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:18]** Four, 10, 18, not 18.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** I'm going to just move you over to the map.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Oh,

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** The map.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** To the map.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** The map.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** So just describe it to our listeners.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** There is a big open field.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:39]** There is a single tower in the middle with a long shadow running to the southwest.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:47]** And then just for our players to see, there is a single space goblin next to the tower.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** And there's a faster toad kind of in the opposite corner of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** What is the goblin doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:54 - 00:58:01]** So what you actually see is a trio of trash hunter junkers balancing on one another's shoulders.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** And as you approach... Drink a fox in a trench coat, yes!

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:15]** Two of the space goblins jump down, kind of side by side, and they all congregate with each other into light.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** Let me find my mouse real quick.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** I lost it.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:48]** so let me just do this boop boop and boop amazing so these three space goblins are kind of huddled together they're giggling and they crikey they all congratulate each other with delight and they're paying no attention to you however the faster toad in the back notices you coming and it starts to step forward with a almost clicking burp and I'm not going to try to mimic that but

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Okay.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** You rolled a perception check.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** What was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** 18.

**[00:58:53 - 00:59:07]** You noticed that one of the space goblins was clutching something to their chests as they turned around and they see you because they recognize the Thastor Toad kind of growling, quote unquote, at you.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Somebody roll an engineering check.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** 19.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:18]** You realize that the goblin is actually holding the electrolytic capacitor.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** Oh.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** I knew you were going to say that.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:27]** I knew you were going to say, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Am I that predictable?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** No, no.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Shucks.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** I want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I want it.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:37]** I'm satisfied that there were three goblins and a trench coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:50]** Until next week, drift beguiles on Distant Stars.
