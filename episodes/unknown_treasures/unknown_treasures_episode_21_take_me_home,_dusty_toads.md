## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:07]** I am Kevin Decker, I am your GM, and this is Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** Welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:10]** Sorry.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Hey there.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** My voice is a little low.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** It's a wrestling voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Hey there, I'm Macho Man Randy Savage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** I'm kidding.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** I'm fine.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** I'm good.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** Macho man Will Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** This morning when I woke up, my voice actually was kind of low, and I was like, what the heck is going on?

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:32]** That would have been perfect for your low-voiced characters.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Will's really good at wrestling.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** All of them.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** That's probably why I'm practicing.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** What's up?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:37]** Did you guys know?

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:42]** I found out today that the term stepping stone is one word.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** That's not true.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** Is it hyphenated?

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** No.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Look it up.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** I don't care if it's in the dictionary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** That way it's wrong.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** Look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** All the dictionaries are wrong.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** I share it with you because I was also flabbergasted, speechless, and astounded.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** So.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** It's inappropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Ruined my whole day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** Ruined my whole day.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** I hate it.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Cool.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Good ep.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:20]** I do have to say, you guys knew I was in California last week for recording.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** This week is a rough one for me.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** I got in last night at 9 p.m.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** and I fly out tomorrow at 9 a.m.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** to go to a different part of the country again.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:38]** Back and forth from Pacific to Eastern, back to Pacific again, I think.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Is Arizona?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** I don't even know what time zone Arizona is on right now.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** I just think they're in Mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** I think it's ours.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Get a map, Kev.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Tell me how that feels.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Yeah, they're in Mountain Time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** How does that make you feel, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:00]** Actually, it depends on where you are in Arizona, because if you're on a Native American reservation, you're probably in a different time zone.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Fun fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:08]** If you go to... I mean, that fact is way more fun than stepping stones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Dude, come on.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** That's such a good fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:17]** I feel like we're scraping the bottom of the barrel with facts.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** I'm not.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Hey, guys.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Did you hear about stepping stone?

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** It's only one word.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** That's very good.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Cool.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Yeah, I wanted to ask you guys, actually.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I cleared this with Kevin ahead of time.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** So I was wondering...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** You don't need my permission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** I don't know.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** All right, fine.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** I'm just going to go for it.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:47]** Is there a phrase that we should give the willing where they can kind of call out to each other and like, you know...

**[00:03:48 - 00:04:13]** demonstrate like their affiliation or whatever like if they meet someone on the street like and they want to like check you know what i mean or if we see them yeah exactly at a convention they're not brave enough to have a will save tattoo yet oh yeah that's true what should they say but they want to check their fandom oh my god yes puns would be that that's a good one uh some would say that this is a stepping stone to a tattoo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** Can we drop a booing sound in post?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** No, we're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I'm going to drop this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:31]** This is some more fun Navy content for you.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** But my ship's motto was anytime, anywhere.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** So it was a call out and return.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** So it was like anytime, anywhere.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Except for it's also like nobody wanted to be on the ship.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** So it was like the captain would do it and everybody else would be like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:05:10]** anywhere submarine like underwater forever and ever and ever and ever yeah because because you're like required to be there like nobody wants to be there anyway yeah i would also anywhere that's how our fans are oh we'll save how about this how about like you know because right now we have drift beacons maybe they can say drift beacons and they could respond back and distant stars i don't know it's just an idea


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** But that's more of a goodbye.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** That's what you would say to someone as you're leaving.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Ah, f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Leaving a conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** Drift beacons and then the forearm grab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** But when you're leaving, I love that.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** The Game of Thrones style handshake.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** The classic.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** And you get matching tattoos on your elbows so you can point to them.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** So they touch?

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:35]** That's how you end a conversation about will save, which of course you would be having when you meet each other.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** But how would you start one?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** I don't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** I think you can just shout, we'll save at the top of your lungs.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** And everybody else in the entire area goes, we'll save.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** We'll serve.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** We'll serve.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** That's it.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** We'll serve.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** We'll serve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Hey, look, I know four other people that listen to the show.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** That's fine, man.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:59]** Obviously, the first answer is they'll recognize the merch that they're wearing.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** That's right.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** Which we will definitely have sometime in the near future.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Speaking of merch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** But before, I mean, we'll talk about buying hats at some point.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** We're working on that.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:17]** But in the meantime, you can download the Snapchat filter of the We'll Save ball cap.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Try one on at home.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Yes.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** It's really good, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** We'll drop that link right here below.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:32]** I'm pointing down to wherever your comment area is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** I've always wanted to be on live television so I could be like,

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Follow the number below.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** What?

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:49]** What's good, Kev, is that if we ever, I don't know, decide to do video, you can be that person who does announcements and we'll put a little ticker.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** I don't want to be the one that, I don't want to like announce it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** I just want to point.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** I just want to be the pointer.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Like a dog.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** I'll put in a lower third for you.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** Yeah.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Okay.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** L3 action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** So yes, we will drop the link that will of will save.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** No relation.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Worked out so well.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** It's a beautiful, honestly, it's a gorgeous filter.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** I suggest everybody do it.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** Is it in the Discord yet?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** You know what I forgot to do, guys?

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** We should put it in the Discord.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** Every time.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** What?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Start your timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Every time.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Yeah, just start it now, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** Okay, so we got to stop BSing around and start playing games.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** Let me type.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, we're at the 10-minute mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Everyone knows that's the unofficial mark in the industry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** Chat.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Filter.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** I'm putting it down as a note so I don't forget about it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:45]** You don't get to be nominated for the People's Choice Podcast Awards two years in a row by ignoring such common conventions as the 10-minute banter filter.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** We can stretch it out another half a minute to explain.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** We were nominated in the Games and Hobbies.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Hobbies and Leisure.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** Games and Hobbies.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Games and Hobbies.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** Games and Hobbies category on the People's Choice Podcast Awards.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** So if you have a chance to vote, go on there and vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:19]** And because this comes out after we know whether we got it or not, we can just cut this if we lost.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** And we're back.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:25]** And we're back, live, from episode 21 of We'll Save.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Take it away, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Because the general rule, if you say we're going to cut this, it stays.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** All right, let's play.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Let's play.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Quick rundown of what happened last time.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** Last time, you rendezvoused at Junkers Delight.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** Varya13 asked you to help them to get to the Stellar Flare.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:53]** You all debated whether or not this side quest would distract or detract from your primary mission of hunting down the leader of the true warriors, Doe Trulu.

**[00:08:53 - 00:09:00]** Ultimately, you decided that the true warriors' interest in Varya 13 makes helping Varya 13 advantageous to that goal.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:08]** Varya 13 joins you as you head out to the outer junk fields, only to be grappled and then pinned by a faster toad's tongue.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** When that happened, they had a vision.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:21]** a vision that Vahri 8, not Vahri 13, but Vahri 8 made it to the escape pods and they heard a voice in their head that said, just give me what I want.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** And then saw pitch black eyes in the darkness.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:30]** And then we jumped right back into the fight and you were, you injured that first Thastor Toad causing to flee back into the hole.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** And then you dispatch the second one shortly thereafter.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:37]** So, uh, let's go over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Let's go to the map.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** And don't forget, we also learned a bit about the outer junk fields.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:47]** You know, Akestis, Space Goblins, Wolf Space Goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Yeah, there's a bunch of Akestis out there.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** John's just reading his notes right now.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Riveners.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Hey, man.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** I hope they're not Riveners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:00]** Kevin didn't specifically mention Riveners, but he did smile really big when they came up in conversation.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** It's Kevin.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Of course it's a Rivener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** I just think they're cool.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** That's all.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** I really miss Rod.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Don't we all?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:12]** All right, so you guys are all, now the map is showing, you're all congregated on the west side of this map.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** There's a huge hole in the center, and there are puddles of disgusting still water kind of all around the hole.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Vari 13 climbs to their feet.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Oh, my.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:27]** I think I will allow you to be the vanguard from now on.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:33]** As shaken as they are, not mechanically, they are quite excited about their vision.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:40]** They share all the details with you, and they explain that I do not know how to interpret this.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Any idea who that voice was?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** I have no idea.

**[00:10:45 - 00:11:06]** scary stuff all right let's keep moving yeah all right so what what now what do you guys want to do is there anything in this area you want to do do you want to pass the hole and keep moving do you want to take a look inside the hole no no no this is gonna roll stealth and kind of roll perception do i see do i notice anything around here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Yeah, Rolu wants to look in the hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:13]** I'll say, well, since you guys are far enough away from the hole, that a perception check probably won't help.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** But if you were to happen to go close to the hole, I think a perception check might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** Tremei is going to come closer to the hole near where the dead toad is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** Rolu is also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** And roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Rolu will go on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** Dang.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** Natural 20.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:55]** second one of the day all right so i guess you're much taller than i expected because you're not exactly on the edge of this hole um i am a tall creature you do see that at the bottom of the hole it's about 10 feet deep with rough walls um you can see the injured dastard toad at the bottom and it's looking up it it locks eyes on you um and it but it seems scared it's weak and scared

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:01]** But since you rolled so high, you also see a container.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** Oh, man.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Shock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:10]** Hey, guys, there's something down there that maybe we should take.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:13]** Could Shock put down his vines and grab it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Shock shakes off the rest of the frock's bit from being wrapped up and says, like, I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** Approximately, what would be the bulk of this item?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Why do you ask questions like that?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** It's bulk seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Bulk seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** No, I have no idea, man.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** It's a big chest.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** It's less than one bulk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:39]** Okay, so Tremé's going to use his psychokinetic hand ability and thrust it into the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** Man, that's why you ask questions like that.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** That's not fair.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:42]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** So you can lift one bulk?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Is that up to one bulk?

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Yes.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Okay, and what is the range on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:53]** You can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** So can you lift something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Do you want me to read the description?

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:03]** You point the finger at a target object, gaining the ability to lift it and move it at will from a distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:08]** So you can lift it, and you're saying your range is 15 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** Yeah, so effectively it could get out of a 10-foot pit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Okay.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** I'm going to ask you for a dexterity check on that.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** You can use your dexterity.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** I just need something.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:28]** The range is 25 feet plus five feet per two levels of the spell.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Why don't you say 15 then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** You guys are reading two different things?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:35]** As a move action, you can propel an object up to 15 feet.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** We're spending too much time on this.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** It means that if you want to, you can throw it, right?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yeah.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Okay.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** But the range of the spell is 25 feet.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** I rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** So you can move any object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** So this LDC is 13, but I think that's to resist it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:13:52 - 00:14:06]** So that Thaster Toad is staring at you, and then the box starts to move, and it turns and kind of jumps away from it, almost like fear, and the container lifts straight up, and then you move it over to you, and you grab it.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** You also avoided one more attack from the Thaster Toad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:16]** That's a... Smart Thaster Toad stayed your hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** It puts the lotion in the basket.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** It's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** What does the box look like?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Is it new?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Is it old?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Yeah, what's in the box?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** It looks pretty worn, but it's pretty easy to open.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:33]** And when you open it, it contains 4,000 UPBs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Yeah.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** And a mind link circlet.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Ooh.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** What does that do?

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Give me a second.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Let me reveal that.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Show to all players.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Yeah, show to everyone.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** It looks like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** It looks like a little... Some fancy jewelry here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** I don't even know.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** It's not a crown.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** It looks like a small crown.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** It's a circlet.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** Duh, it's called a circlet.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** It's got a red... A diadem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** A diadem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** Tiara.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Cool.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Yeah.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** TR is probably going to read what it does.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:15]** You can telepathically communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with which you share a language.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** This functions like a Sheeran's limited telepathy.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** I like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Shout out to Sheeran's.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** That's rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** That's dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** Cool.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** I'm going to keep it unless somebody wants to roll off for it.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** I don't mind to split these credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** All yours to me.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Did you guys all bring your dice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Who was that?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** If your characters are rolling dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:47]** I would consider keeping this to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Yeah, I think I'd like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** I like shiny stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:56]** I mean, I'm going to say I speak multiple languages as a merchant.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** Perhaps...

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** It might be best in my hands, but you never know.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Sure, I'll roll off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:08]** From a metagaming perspective, I think we have the same amount of languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:12]** I feel like Termay, not Termay, but Shaq would just be around.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** I have six besides Common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** We talked about this.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Chalk has like six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** He's like a diplomat or something.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** I also speak six besides Common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** I speak six languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Let's roll off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** Are you going to roll the natural 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** I also rolled the natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** How are there four natural 20s already?

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** We're going to die this game.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:42]** We've heard all of your meaningless rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** All right.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Let's re-roll, Will.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** Here we go.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Let me do the Kev roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** I got an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** I got a 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Take it!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Fine.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** I'm going to roll like ones the rest of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** I know.

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Yeah.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** It's terrible.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Maybe I just feel compelled that it's better in your hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** Thanks, I guess, Rolu.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:24]** And Tremé's a little like, you know, having some of the, you know, revelations about his dealings with another ship.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** He's a little reserved around him.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** He's just...

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** He's not rude.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** He's not trying to let it on, but he's definitely a little curt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:42]** I think what's really funny is the mental picture of this slim, feminine tiara on big, bad termaitin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** He's hooded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:50]** Do you put it on under or over your hood?

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:05]** I would assume it wouldn't work over the hood, but for flavor, I will say it's over the hood, but I would guess that it's under for the sake of working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** All right.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:09]** Yes, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Go ahead, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:34]** I think while Treme is starting to figure out if the diadem is going above or below the hood, I think Rolo just wants to walk over to Vahri and just kind of check in now that maybe people have walked away and Vahri has a minute to collect themselves and just say, Vahri, are you sure that you're all right?

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** It seemed like this flashback was quite intense.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** I just couldn't help but want to check in with you again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** I, I'm, I'm fine.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** I'm, I really, I need to continue.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:51]** I, I need to find the stellar flare, but I, I will, I will stay in back.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** I will let you lead the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** All right.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** Just be safe.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** We can't afford to lose you now.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Are we ready to press on?

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** Jack, Jack turns to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** I'm, I'm, uh, I'm not feeling too hot.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Any, any chance we could take a break for a bit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** That's fine.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Do what you need to do to recover before moving on.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:17]** Do you need stamina points or do you need hit points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:26]** Kevin, is there anything to the north of this circle here?

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** Or is it just east?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Or is there an exit to the north as well?

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** It kind of looks like there's an opening there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:44]** Um, this isn't going to be like some Zelda style, uh, forest or anything.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** So you can go out both ways.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** Uh, and it, but it all ultimately just leads to like desert.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Okay, cool.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** So it's not like this room goes to that room.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** That makes sense.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Okay.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Gotcha.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Okay.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Does that explain?

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Does that answer your question?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** It does.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Sorry, this is more Navy crap.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** When I was going through school in the Navy, one of my favorite things about it was the way they taught.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** We need a drop for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** More Navy.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** Yeah, we really do.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** In the Navy.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** But the Navy did so much research on how to teach people quickly.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** And so when the teachers are trained, they're actually trained to be a very certain way.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:28]** And one of them is whenever you're spoken to and asked a question, you repeat the question back and you always ask if the question was answered.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** Um, and, and it stuck with me and nobody in the real world does it.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:36]** Um, so like that you asked, uh, is there anything to the, to the top here or is there only one way out?

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** I would ask.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:41]** So your question is, is there only one way up and there's no other way out?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** Did that, did that answer your question?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Okay.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:49]** Also, you never say variables as the variable.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** You will say them as their term.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:54]** So heat flux is written as heat flux.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** It might be written as Q dot.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Like it's written as Q dot.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** But if you say Q dot, you get yelled at.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** So it's like written Q dot spoken heat flux.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Anyways.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Moving on!

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** Check.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** I will pull out a healing serum.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** Check.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** I'm going to administer a healing serum.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** It might hurt.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Stand still.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Stabby, stabby, stabby.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Open up your eye very wide.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Do I roll or do you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Whoever's administering it, you roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** Okay, 3 HP.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** That's what Kev does for fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:14]** During this time, I'm going to maybe look around and see this canyon and see if there's any like cool junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** I have been looking for this.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** I've got the PDF, and I'm, like, searching for it.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** I still can't find it.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:26]** There's a fun fact about the Thaster Toads that I want to share.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** I don't know it.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** I'm trying to find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** You've got the floor, Kev.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Well, you got to roll like a license check to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** Is this a stepping stone fun fact or an Arizona fun fact?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Get out.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** It's so good.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** It's so good.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** The best pizza in the world is apparently in Phoenix, Arizona.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Fun fact for everyone.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Where?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** I still vehemently disagree.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** It's in Connecticut.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Okay.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** So what is everyone doing?

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:19]** during this to me you're looking around to me he's looking around i'm reading i'm reading the rule book thaddeus is gonna follow to me i'll go with you to me let's scout about check like organizes a plant bed while he takes his 10 minute rest cute i think rola's gonna talk to vari 13 and ask them about everything they know about i found it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** Time for a random fact that's not Navy related from GM Kevin Decker.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** This is your fun fact minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** I missed what John said because I was too excited.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Faster toads were in the Navy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Yeah, no, it's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Somebody roll me a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** This better be good.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** This better be good.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** All right.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** I'll set the DC low for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** Dude, get out of here, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** So many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Very nice.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** So fun fact is Thassertodes speak.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Well, they don't speak.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** They can't speak.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** But they understand Goblin.

**[00:23:52 - 00:24:14]** okay i just love that fact that was hey kevin kevin spent 15 minutes i love it you know i was just thinking about the faster tone well no it's it's one of those things like this encounter it's one of those things like like it's i i just look at if i just like speak a goblet next time maybe we can avoid the

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:34]** right like role role play in general like there's it's there's you know oh it's combat oriented we're just shoot things but like if you would have come in here and the faster toad was like whipped around your ankle and you're like hey stop it and goblin it might stop are you telling me that role play is important and we all just role played in front of you and you just ignored all of us

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** I know I talked over you to tell you how much it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** It's called GM splitting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Wow.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** Hey, did everyone's map go black or was that just me?

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** No, just you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** I think I deleted my token, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** You're gone, bro.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Yeah, actually, you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** You fell down the hole.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Just lift yourself out to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** The crate you opened was trapped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:06]** Kevin, I think you need to actually bring him back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** No, I'm bringing you back in, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** Okay, but you need to bring Will's token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** All right.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:16]** I think you're like telling me to like, Hey, corral the cats, bring them back.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Everybody pays attention.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** We need you to focus.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** And you're telling me like, no, actually like put them back on the map.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Like, fine.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** I'll do my job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Sorry.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** That's so much to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** I had to fix your mistakes.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Just had to find that fun fact about the toads.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** All right.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:44]** I'm just going to talk to Vari 13 about the stellar flare and Tremaden and, uh, did you guys each add a thousand credits to your characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** It was not credits.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** It was UPV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** Oh, that's even better.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** Which are effectively the same thing, but technically different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** I think there's a, there's a, I think there's a subtle difference.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:21]** well there's a what's it what's it called when you trade in money for money exchange rate yeah i think there's an exchange rate for it there is but it's one to one okay everybody the value of a credit is set by john is trying to talk to dude i have said it so many times the listeners like let's just move on so but no we'll just move on paddling back up this river oh my god so john what do you do nobody cut him off this time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:28]** Rolu's going to talk to Varya13 about the Stellar Flare.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** You don't actually need to roleplay it.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** I'm just saying Rolu's interested in knowing more.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Oh, I mean, I heard that part.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** I thought you were going to roleplay it.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** No.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** No.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** We're trying to move on.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Let's move on.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** We are taking so much time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Do you have any specific questions or are you just asking generic questions?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Hey, he talks to her about Stellar Flare.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Yeah, they talk back and answer your questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** He wants to know what the mission of the Stellar Flare was.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** He wants to know how long ago this was.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** He wants to know the crew complement of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:57]** He wants to know the manufacturer of the ship.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** What was the original mission?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** That's great.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** Okay.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:08]** So what VARI 13 tells you is from everything that they were able to research because they weren't actually on it.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** It's not their ship.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** It was VARI 8's ship.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:22]** They know that the Stellar Flare was researching some kind of technology that would utilize drift energy as a power source locally.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** so everybody's flying around in these, these brand new drift engines.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** Um, but like, what if there's more to that?

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** What if you can actually harness that energy some other way?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:39]** Um, as for the crew compliments, I, there is somewhere in the notes I can look back and tell you exactly what size the ship it is.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:46]** And you can search for through the star finder books to find out, you know, how many people are on it, but it was a research vessel.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Um,

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Is there anything else you want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** All to be fair, though.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:01]** So let me just clarify, just so everybody else can hear.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** Your question was, tell me everything about Stellar Flare.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** Did I answer your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:14]** I just wanted to show Rolu's interest in more of the Stellar Flare, including information that I'm sure me, John the player, doesn't.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:18]** No, but... Didn't listen to on the intro to this episode.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** I already did.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** It's not meant to... Okay.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** All right.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Let's keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** I'll go.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:27]** It hurts my feelings, John, when you don't listen to all the hard work that I put into reading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:31]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this, but... All right.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Moving on.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** Thaddeus is going to say to me, look at this over here.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** Awfully suspicious.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** And he kind of, like, goes to this little cliff thing.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** And then he just, like, whispers to Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:48]** He's like, Treme, I took a look at those audio files that I downloaded.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** And to me, you seem a little off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Look at this part here.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:05]** And then he like identifies the part where the shirts and like the star maps are talked about and how it was odd that Hears, you know, was delivering those to Rola directly.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Why would Hears do this directly?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** And then he like plays the audio file.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** Doesn't that seem odd to you?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Or anything else seems suspicious?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Listen, what do you think?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** He says it kind of like a little crazily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:30]** He's like... I think it's best not to dwell on it for now, but we should keep an eye out for certain.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:38]** That's good, but seriously, when you have time, take a listen again and let me know what you think, all right?

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** And then Tormey's going to like...

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:49]** try out his little mind link with Thaddeus.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Oh, that's actually perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Yeah, that's dope for a clandestine conversation.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** So I can respond back the same way, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:03]** Can't, because they're descendants of Shirin, no?

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:10]** Like the species, Witchwords and Progenitor.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** No, not Patros.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Yeah.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Patros are not descendants of Witchwords.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:24]** Kasathan's Witchwords and actually Shabak's are all kind of of the same origins, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** Which word?

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Progenitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Which word?

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:32]** He points towards the direction you guys are going to travel.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Where do you want to go?

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** North?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** We'll talk more about this later.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:43]** He hears that in his brain telepathically and responds back telepathically because I think that's how it works.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Good call.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Because I have the mind link.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:54]** If it's like a Sheeran thing, when the Sheerans talk to them, they can respond back telepathically.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** You can have a conversation in their head.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** That's how it works with years anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Is that what Mind Link does?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:08]** So Mind Link is shameless plug for threefold conspiracy.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:13]** Mind Link is the ability that Colin used to relive.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:19]** Here's his memory of the fourth dimensional shades that he put on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** Oh, and this is a mind link circlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:29]** So it says you can telepathically communicate with any creature within 30 feet with which you share a language.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:35]** This functions like a Shirin's limited telepathy racial trait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** And that trait allows them to respond back to you telepathically.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** It's two way for Shirin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** Yeah, it's not just one way.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** So it's just a misnomer, like, in the naming.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** Like, it doesn't give you the mind link ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Yeah.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Get together, Paizo.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** JK, we love you.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Don't.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** We want you to shout us out one day.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** All right, yeah, you're right.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Yeah, Huel.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Thanks, Huel.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** Rolu runs away at full speed.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** So that's circling.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Let's circle back to the circling.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** Okay, so you guys walk out the north path?

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Here we go.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** Okay.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Yeah.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** I have already said it doesn't matter which direction you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** We're going north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** You're going out into the desert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** Well, we're trying to find the... We're following the beacon.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** I thought we had a beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** That's what we're following.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** We're going the shortest path to the beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Right.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** But in order to do that, I'm going to need a survival check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** From anyone in particular?


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** Naturally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** From one.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** One person, and I'll let one person assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:48]** I have zero survival, but I have it.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I have plus four.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** I think you should roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Does anyone have higher than that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Show us where to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** I had to survive the jungles and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:04]** Yeah, I have been rolling rocks, though, but only on skill checks.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Oh, no.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Is there any bonus he gets from following that beacon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** All right, so by that, I think we're going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:17]** So Kevin's going to love this, but effectively, because I rolled a one, plus the four is five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** You can't.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** So it's a five total.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** What, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** What's the matter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:35]** Does skill check... I feel like it's always debated that on skill checks there's not really any benefit to, like, natural 1 or... No, there's not.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** That's good, so we're not completely screwed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** You rolled a natural 20 to assist in a skill check, is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Does anyone want to help us survive assisting, maybe?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** I mean, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Well, no.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** You've got a long way to go if you're starting at 5.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** I rolled a 4, so I don't...

**[00:33:52 - 00:34:15]** well the dc was 18. um kevin yeah i'd so bad and have like a critical fail for you guys but um cool so we just go the wrong direction where you wanted to make uh all right so the front chance half as you come into this you're walking along and you come into this uh almost like a cavern not a cavern but a canyon area

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:22]** And you see the front half of a massive dark green starship that looms above, blotting out the sun.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Across the hole are 20-foot letters.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Can anybody read Vaskarian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** So you point out to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** I can as well, actually.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** We can all read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** You all know Vesperian.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** Great.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** So you guys can all just naturally read.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** It says Thundering Angel or translates to Thundering Angel across the hole.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:50]** You see broken weaponry, laser rays, plasma cannons.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** They jut out from the hole and they are casting long shadows across the ground.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:00]** There's small craters, each ringed with scorch marks, marred with red dirt.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:10]** And past that, you see a small, rustic, three-sided shelter made from panels of the starship that stands kind of at the end of this clearing.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** So let me take you over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:18]** Do we know anything about, can we recall knowledge of this ship?

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** You can try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** What role would that be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** I would guess culture.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** And I got a 23.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:30]** With a 23, you know that it is.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** Let me Google a Vaskarian ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:38]** I meant the name, but was it in any battles that we know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:42]** Yes, it was in the Battle of, let me Google a Starfinder battle.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Yeah, I got nothing for you.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Sorry, I'm not that good.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Any Battle of the Jubilee formation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** Yes, the Vizcarian Battle of...

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Yes, it's in here somewhere.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I didn't prep for that.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** I'm sorry because I'm a bad GM.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Hold on.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** Give me a second.

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Here it goes.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** Before the Pact Worlds, the Vescarium signed a peace treaty decades ago.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** They fought several violent engagements.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:11]** The Vescarian warships that entered the Pact Worlds space were eventually repelled or destroyed.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:17]** The wreckage of the Vescarian cruiser named Thundering Angel is what lies in front of you.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** It was there.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** I just needed to find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:27]** Does anyone know anything about this ship?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** This is not the Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** No.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:38]** It just was during the Pact World something?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** Like the Vesk fought the Pact Worlds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** Just decades ago there was a war between the Pact Worlds and the Vesk.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** And this is a casualty of that war?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Yes.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Let's proceed cautiously.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:53]** There's a whole little area with a bunch of junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** So I explained it when I read it off, but if you want to just explain.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:11]** So it's kind of like a long tunnel, a corridor, and you guys are off on the right side, and you can see the shelter that I talked about on the other side, and the gun's kind of in the middle, and there's three dirt holes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:15]** Perhaps it's good to fan out as we approach this shelter.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Yeah.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** Good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** And he rolls a 24 for stealth.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** Okay, 24 is good for stealth.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Can you tell me how fast are you walking?

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Will that affect...

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:51]** thyself in some way it may it may affect your stuff he's gonna walk as much as on a scale of let's just do quarter you know i can go you can speed zero is stopped one is moving and then you can go three quarters half so what you're saying is that you can move at four different speeds essentially


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:59]** He can move stealthily, but no matter how high your stealth roll is, you can still be found out, I guess, if you move faster.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** He's introducing a new mechanic.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** How many steps per turn?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Is that a new mechanic?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Is that your own special mechanic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:12]** Yeah, that's what makes it easy, because you know your full speed, so if you're going half your speed, you cut it in half.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** If you're going a quarter of your speed, you cut it in half.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** I'm introducing math!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Wait, I just have a question.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Is this a Kevin invention?

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** We will answer that in plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** Rolu wants to roll perception on these holes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Clever girl.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:35]** It's a 13 Jurassic Park reference that Vinny won't get, right, Vinny?

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** You said you never saw Jurassic Park?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** Never saw Jurassic Park, but I thought that was a Doctor Who reference.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Talking about Clara Oswin-Odwalt.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** It's not.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** No, but it could be, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:49]** It's definitely a Jurassic Park reference, but maybe the Jurassic Park reference was a Doctor Who reference, depending on the time frame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** I think we take this to Twitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** I'm not a Doctor Who-er.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** What did I get on a 13?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** You see dirt.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:05]** And when you look across the open field, you can actually see divots in the dirt that are charred and blackened.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** I don't know what's going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** May I roll perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:14]** But your perception, from what you can tell, is like it's possibly from cannon blasts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** Go ahead and roll perception, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I just rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:24]** Okay, but natural 20s don't mean anything in this game for skill checks.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** So what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:32]** My perception is zero, so 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Great.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** So I can tell you that you see an open field in a few spots.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** You see some...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:37 - 00:40:01]** divots with some dirt that are charred in black possibly damage from a cannon blast check looks really closely at that lean to shelter looking thing um with a 23 i think he's primarily looking for like is this vibrating sort of like the kafok infestations we've seen elsewhere on this planet can you point to where exactly you're talking about

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** I'm going to use the circle shape in roll 20.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** I'm looking at this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Okay, yeah, yeah, okay.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** From what you can tell, that is... It's definitely like... I wouldn't say man-made.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** It's a terrible term in this world especially.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Right.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** But it is a construct of some sort.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Sure.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** It didn't just fall off the ship.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** It is definitely somebody built this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Right.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Is it inhabited, I think, is what he's trying to deduce.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Guys...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** From your distance, you wouldn't be able to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Okay.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:47]** Hey, these divots here, are they... Do you think they're fresh?

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:52]** Do you think this cannon fire mortar maybe...

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** Are we downrange from that shack over there, do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** I think it's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:11]** Could I maybe closer investigate with survival to see how eroded perhaps these divots are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** I'll say, I mean, if you want to move closer to look at them, you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** I think we need to get closer, all of us, just far and stay in the back.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Move one.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** All right.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Fan out.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Yeah.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Okay.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** I'm looking at the closest one.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Okay.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** To me, you walk up to that one.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** I'll walk 15 feet ahead to the one that's in the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** Thaddeus is moving at half speed per your new mechanic, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Stop.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** There's a minefield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Everybody stop.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** So Thaddeus, go ahead and move your character back to where you were.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** At full speed.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:49]** So just for the listener, they started off on almost a line against the east wall of the map.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:54]** Tremei moved one square over.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** Rolu moved one square over and then moved two squares over.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** And that's when Thaddeus moved, but after I told him to stop.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** So I'm giving Thaddeus a break there.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:10]** Okay.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** Give me a reflex save.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Roll it.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:22]** This is not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** You have your damage.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** What is it that mechanically is affecting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** Give me half a second, man.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** He's getting there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** He's getting there.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Is it a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Two and four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** That's my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Four.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:57]** So eight plus two is ten points of damage as a plasma torpedo explodes in a ball of bluish green energy.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** So I take five damage from this?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Ten.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** Yeah.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Yeah, you take five damage, yeah.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Okay.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Woof.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Yes, woof.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Woof.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** That bomb was right there.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** Let me see.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Can I go to the GM lair?

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Yep.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** I'm just going to drop this down so you guys see where it was at.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Boom.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** That was the trigger point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** Can we see, like, any indication of how it was triggered?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** Was it like a trap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Everyone stand still.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:37]** So, I mean, from where you're standing now, you saw it explode, you covered your eyes, Rolu's probably pretty badly hurt.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:54]** You can, like, the remnants of it, you can tell it's not like, it wasn't necessarily a trap, but they're dangerous weapons that have fallen out of the ship and just been buried over time.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** How do you want to proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:07]** Is there any evidence of where these weapons might be in the rest of the field between us and that shelter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** If you can give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Roll in.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:20]** That is... Scroll down to perception.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** 16.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** Okay, so Chak, you are still kind of up against that east wall.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:34]** You do not see any additional torpedoes in your area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:39]** Is there a radius that he would feel confident in that assertion to?

**[00:44:40 - 00:45:04]** yes i'm gonna do what my son does whenever you guys ask me questions yes or no okay i'll be like gracie can you say disgusting and he'll go yes thanks to to be clear when i ask if there's a radius and you say yes that means you're answering in the affirmative so your question is is there a radius to your confidence uh and the answer is yes did that answer your question what is that radius

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** No, it didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:09]** That I cannot answer.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** All right, who's next?

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** Do you guys want to set yourself up in initiative order and make this a little bit easier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Yeah, let's make it initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** I don't need your roll.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** You guys can just pick.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Who's going first?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** We'll say Roller's first because he already moved.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Chalk went second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** I'll go third.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** Oh, no, no, no, Termay should be third because he moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** So Termay is third, and Thaddeus is fourth?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** Yeah, and the Androids.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** But Vahri is going to stay back and watch.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** So you did a stealth roll, Thaddeus.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** I did.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** And you never answered my question.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** How quickly do you want to move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:50]** It was a 24, but, I mean, literally... Okay, so I guess half the speed at whatever...

**[00:45:51 - 00:46:09]** roll you just did but before he does that he's gonna roll perception and it was a 15 so in front of him this like path does he feel confident moving forward safe i'm gonna do you guys a favor and for every torpedo you blow up i'll reduce the dc by two


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:31]** great i have a question the reflex the reflex dc okay so this is where the torpedo was with a t that's there's like an explosion here yeah it's like five feet behind world and for the listener yeah uh sorry yeah okay kevin yeah go ahead will no i'm good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:41]** Kevin, since it's... Okay, I have really high acrobatics, so can I just kind of flip around very lightly or walk on my hands or something like that to prevent triggering this?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Tiptoe as a cat?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** I'm a cat, dude.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** I have a very high acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** That I'm going to...

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** I'll allow that.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** So you're either going to roll the perception DC or you have to roll an athletics.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** You said athletics or acrobatics?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Acrobatics.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:01]** Equal to the perception DC is what I'm going to require.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Okay, it's a 28, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Wow.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Okay.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Move wherever you want to move.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** I mean, that makes sense.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** Show me where you're going.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** Thaddeus like kind of like gets on his hands and does a hand step.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** He's like, whoop.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:16]** And then he just starts like, you know, like twiddling his like fingers as he moves over here.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** So that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** So we'll take a, actually he'll take a full act.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:26]** Actually this he'll, you'll move your full speed.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Yeah.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** I'm going to move my full speed actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** I'm going to make you roll another athletics if you're going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** Okay, in that case, I'm going to stop and wait a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Stop.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Wait a minute.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** All right.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** From there, go ahead and give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Okay, cool.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** That's what I was hoping to do.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:43]** Nice.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** That's a 22.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** 22?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Not enough.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:51]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** But, yeah.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** To see if there are mines there.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:16]** yeah okay can can with that perception can i see if there's anyone in that like shanty over there or whatever um yeah it's not supposed to be the same perception but yeah i'll give that to you you can see that you can't see anybody currently like there's nobody your line of sight okay uh so let's go back to the top it is now rolu's turn wait what about do we all go

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:26]** Yeah, we said Thaddeus moved and Chak did his thing and then – or Tremé did his thing and then – I think – Tremé only moved one earlier.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** You only moved one square.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Then that's when Rolu got blown up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:39]** Then I think Rolu is going to see Thaddeus be acrobatic and not wanting to be outdone but also just trying to take some inspiration from him.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Rolu is going to –

**[00:48:41 - 00:49:00]** and try and like shake off the feeling of this sudden blast and he's going to try and tap in a little bit to his like inner sense of balance and he's going to like slowly move his robes into a very calm and ready position

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** And then he's going to move in this very like circular foot pattern.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:12]** And I'm also going to roll acrobatics to try and move 15 feet or 20 feet ahead, but I'm going to do so in like slow.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:19]** If you picture like the walk from dune where they're like moving in the erratic pattern, like that kind of flowy movement, he's going to try and.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:37]** moving you're swiping your feet don't they swipe their feet i'm not actually doing that but it's yeah it's that kind of movement that's like flowy and it's yeah they're they're doing that to avoid like making vibrations and you're if you're gonna slide your feet through saying i am not sliding my feet okay

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** I'm just moving in a circular fashion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** Meanwhile, Will's over here playing Battleship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** I rolled a 29, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** You rolled a 29 for acrobatics?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** That's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** Okay, go ahead and move where you're going to move, and I'll tell you whether or not you blow up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Okay, I was just going to move under the gun.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:04]** I was going to move 15 feet ahead, and I'll be right underneath the guns of the thundering angel.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Moving under the gun, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:12]** All right, so Rolu is on the kind of like the northest part of the map underneath the guns and the shadows there.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Go ahead and roll me a perception check.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** 18.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** 18 is not enough.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** Yeah.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Not enough.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** But I didn't blow up?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** No, you did not blow up.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Chalk's turn.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:31]** Chalk is going to trace Rolu's steps.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:36]** Actually, I'm going to take a quick measurement to see if I can get that far.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** I can.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** I'm going to trace Rolu's steps and climb on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** I'm fine if you blow up.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** All right.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** And you don't have to roll anything.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** But since you're there, roll perception.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Eleven.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Eleven.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** No, that's not enough.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Okay.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** Torme, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:03]** Torme is going to look over to Vahri and say, You may wish to follow my steps closely coming across.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:11]** I am assuming that these areas that have already detonated are safe.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** And I'm going to follow the same path that Rolo did.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Hmm.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** But don't be too close because, you know, in case I fuck up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** In case the bridge collapses, that was a different mechanic.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** Yeah, we can use acrobatics.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** All right, so you're just going to follow that same path.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** Yeah, I'm going to get to the same spot, basically.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** I like it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:44]** So, yeah, just as I said before, Will's been putting purple Xs on all the squares that they're passing through so they know that there's not going to be any bombs there, which is actually really smart.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** I'll allow it.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:53]** I'm going to say Varya's going to follow you then on your turn and just stay close.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** And then it is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:27]** did thaddeus go straight across just like on his uh tiny paws tippy toes yes they're perfectly fine thanks they're big enough all right he's gonna uh roll another acrobat another acrobatics check i guess although fuck with kevin numbers it's not gonna pass it's an 11 i'm where are you moving


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Yeah, go ahead and move where you're going to move.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** We'll see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:38]** All right, so I'm going to move right here and possibly aggro a bunch of shit, but here we go.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** Oh!

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Oh, a bomb went off.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** He moved 15 feet straight ahead.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Nothing happened.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** So I went at half speed.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Half speed, by the way, Kevin, that's your thing, remember?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** Half speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** I asked you what you were going to do, and you never did it.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** And really, I'll let you know.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:57]** The mechanic of the book says if they're going half speed, let them roll a perception check without blowing up.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:02]** But you rolled a low acrobatics and ran right over a torpedo.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** So let's go ahead and blow you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Oh, boom.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Wait, I have to roll a reflex save, right?

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Yes, roll a reflex save.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** It's 18.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** 18.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** So you get to have this.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** That is a 3.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** A 1.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** A five.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** So three, one, and five is a total of nine.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** So I have that four.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** You round up, up, down, four?

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Down.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Yeah, down to four.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Okay, so I did four damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Unless it benefits us, and then we round it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Yes, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** Drop this down for you to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Thaddeus, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Thaddeus!

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** Some of his, like, fur is, like, singed.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** He just kind of, like, puts it out with, like, a finger.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:54]** He's like, a little better than you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:00]** I'm sorry to... God, that took me by surprise.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Are you okay, Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:07]** Slight ringing in my ears, but once you find your inner balance, it goes away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Let's keep moving.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** It's going to be philosophical.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** It's not the time, but I hope everyone's all right.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Proceed carefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** My God.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** All right.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** It is now Rolu's turn.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** Rolu's going to keep doing his Tai Chi walk.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:26]** And I think he is going to move, actually.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** Let me see what I roll, and then I'll tell you where I want to go.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Cool.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** I roll the 13 and I want to go here.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** So I want to walk one, two, three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Okay.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** And go ahead and roll me a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** Oh, no perception check.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** No, you already walked.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** 18.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** So you get to have this again.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** That's four.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** Mechanical question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Before we apply all this damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** So eight points of damage.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** You take four damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:07]** Since I'm riding on his shoulder, do I also get to make the perception check?

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:11]** Did you forfeit your move action to stay on his shoulder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** I did.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:16]** So you have to roll a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** So I take the reflex, but I don't get the opportunity for a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** You'll get that on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Got it.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Got it.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** I don't see reflex on here.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** What?

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** What am I?

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Oh, plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** Defenses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** Cool.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** 23 passes.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** So you each take four points of damage.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:39]** Did I just, and just in case this matters, it's fire and energy because it's plasma and plasma does that.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** Okay.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** Chalk, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** I've been worse.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Very recently.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** At least it's not frog spit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** From where you are, you can roll a perception check.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** 23.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** 26.

**[00:55:54 - 00:56:00]** 26 passes the original DC.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** 23 doesn't?

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** No.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** I didn't set these DCs, man.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** They're out of the book.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:11]** Okay, I made some of these DCs up, but that's because I... Anyways.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:17]** So you can see that there are no more... Here, I'll draw a nice big circle for you.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** How do I do circles on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:24]** The draw slash shape button and pick circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Oh, that's not where I want it.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** It's like this.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** I'll say like that.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Okay.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Is that close enough to your...

**[00:56:33 - 00:57:00]** area so from your area there's kind of a radius around you that you can see about 15 maybe 20 feet that you can clearly see like there's nothing in the sand you get this like sixth sense about it there's nothing there hey guys I think up near us is pretty clear you should just make your way up here just follow the path sounds good cool so you guys kind of follow each other's paths now I'm on the wrong thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:29]** and as uh termay is coming up to the shelter he's gonna have uh his guns sort of man i don't know how to get rid of this circle now that i drew it uh there's a large pink circle on the map now use uh cool so nice use the select slash move tool to click on the circle and then hit the delete button yeah it won't it won't like grab it it's like you gotta click on the circle itself


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** I'm trying, man.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** I'm trying.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** I'm not going to sit here and fight the computer.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Okay, cool.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** So you guys basically make it through this minefield for what it is.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Congratulations.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** You survived.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** On the other side of the plasma torpedo field.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:57]** Near the base of what you know to be the Thundering Angel wreckage, you find a makeshift living space using tarps to protect it from the elements.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:01]** A heavy-duty sleeping bag is stretched across a broken command table.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** It serves as a bed.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:11]** There's half-eaten, moldy energy bars that lie on the bed, and there's evidence that nobody has been here for probably over a week or so.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:18]** So go ahead and give me, each of you guys, give me a perception check from where you are.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:21]** There's moldy stuff?

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** Yeah, there's like food out that got moldy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** 17.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** I'm surprised there's enough moisture for stuff to mold you.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** 10.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** Perception?

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:33]** 13.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** Termay, you see that there is a data pad underneath the pillow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:45]** So I'm going to grab the data pad and take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:49]** You also note that there's a steel box under the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Steel boxes could have loot.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Termay, what do you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** Let's open this thing up, shall we?

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** Let's crack it open.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Is it one bulk?

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** It just flies out?

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** Because I'm so giddy for it, I just want to grab it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** So what are you going to do first?

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** Are you going to try to do the data pad or are you going to do the bulk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** I was going to do the data pad first.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:19]** But then seeing the...

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:43]** box of goodies i'm gonna do the uh the box first to me you might want to exercise caution after all this minefield seems like we could be in a place with the traps can i perceive a trap can i also just use my psychokinetic hand and pull it out and see if there's like a thing that way can i spring the

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Spring the trap door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** You're asking a lot of questions and I can't keep up with them.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** So let me see.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** Your question was, can I perceive a trap?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Yes.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:55]** I'm going to say if you want to roll something, you probably could.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Perception.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Does that answer that question?

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:00]** And then your next question was, can you use psychokinetic hand?

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Yes, you could.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Does that answer that question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Okay.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Okay.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I really want to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:12]** I'm going to roll for perception for a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** 15.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** All right.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:21]** So I feel confident that there's not a trap.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** So I'm going to still use my psychokinetic hand to move it over to in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]** Let me just clarify exactly how far away you are at this point.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]** So you're about one square away from the shack.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** So I'll say you are about 10 feet from the bed.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Go ahead.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Your hand starts to pull out the data pad.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** The mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** You went back to the data pad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:05]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
