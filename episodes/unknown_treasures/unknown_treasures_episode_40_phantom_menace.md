## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin, and the clock is ticking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:07]** Ticking on Chuck's life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** I was just about to say that, on Chuck's life.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:10]** I don't even want to banter, man.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:12]** I just want to jump back into it and see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:39]** house is gonna roll out now we need a banter though it's like half the reason you need a banter i need something to get my mind off of it we need something so we yeah just i have honestly forgot about it for the past week yeah you led up last week talking about ghosts and now we are seemingly confronting them but um i want to i want to know what's in like shock's will for each of us yeah yeah it's a good question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:40]** That is a good question.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:46]** What did you leave your good friend Thaddeus, who you know is on your side, by the way?

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** To Thaddeus?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** I leave my date with that.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** I think you would do it as a video will.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Oh, that's actually really useful.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** It's very useful.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** Getting some evidence against Rolu in that, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:01]** As useful as yours has been, I hope mine doubly so.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** What do you leave to Rolu, who you know is actually on your side?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:11]** To Rolu, I leave my survival knife for all the backs you've stabbed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** This will make it easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:19]** This will make that you would be the one who would see the light.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Who would know the truth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** Chuck, did you leave me anything?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:29]** To Mayadin, I leave my second skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** It's really small, though, so I don't... Can you wear it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** May it bring you comfort on those cold nights in space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** I feel like that's a shawl on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Yeah.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** It's like a sock.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** What would you leave to our GM?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, what did you leave to the GM?

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Everything else.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Your body and soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Right.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** We'll, like, if Shaq dies, we're going to do what people do with, like, flowers where they kind of, like, fold you into, like, a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** You're, like, flat.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** You're flat.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Yes.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** To cap the GM, I leave my reanimated corpse.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** Yeah.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:18]** I'm sure we can get some magic user to do little tricks to bring your body to life in a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** Like grave words?

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** To make us grave words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Click the tombstone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Every tenth time on average, like...

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:33]** Some like crazy crushing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I'm going to do that on my tube.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** I bet you will.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** I'll put it in like a Raspberry Pi or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, like a QR code kind of thing.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** People scan it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Oh, perfect.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:48]** It'd be like the hologram from iRobot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** You're not going to make it a motion sensor so that people who walk by hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:53 - 00:04:00]** I'm going to do like a motion sensor and it'll like tip over like a flower pot nearby or something behind, you know, so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:06]** And then like, like in that timeframe that they could see it happen, it just stands back up.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** Yeah.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Yeah, it's awesome.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Chuck's almost dead, guys.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Chuck's almost dead.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** We'll try to get you out of this scrape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Don't worry.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Yeah, we're doing our best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:23]** Does anybody else have anything else to talk about before we... No, my heart is heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** Let's get it.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** Did we all look up the dying rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** It's complicated, aren't they?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** It's complicated, but it's not.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:40]** So I check any creature that hits zero hit points.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** And remember, there are certain types of damage that target hit points before stamina points.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:52]** Have until the end of their next turn to stabilize or get back in the fight or be healed.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Otherwise, they lose a resolve point.

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:05]** If a character who has zero hit points already takes more damage at the start of their turn, they lose another resolve point.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:15]** If during that same turn they receive damage equal to or greater than half of their hit points, they lose another resolve point.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:28]** So, in theory, if Kev's shenanigans can do greater than 10 hit points of damage to Dead Shack, I might be in trouble.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** So, you know, we'll see.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** We'll stabilize, we'll heal, we'll do what we do.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Because we're adventurers and we're pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** So you have full RP?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Yes.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Going down?

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** I have zero stamina, I have zero hit points, but I have full RP.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** So I've got that going for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Yeah.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** It's something.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** It's the gates of hell, but it's not quite hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** It's all part of the job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:06]** Well, I think... Hopefully I put my totem in the just-visiting side of the space and not the hell side of the space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:12]** I feel like you would go kicking and screaming into hell in a very Shaq way.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** You wouldn't... You won't let it happen easily.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** And we're not going to let it happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Not without a fight, that's for sure.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** I will not go quietly into that good night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** You like to look into the devil's eyes and scare him.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** I know you.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** You got this, man.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** With your madness.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Exactly.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** The insanity inside Shaq.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** You'll be running hell soon.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:40]** I need a couple more low will saves and, excuse me, low wisdom checks and we're golden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:48]** Still my favorite mechanic of all time is Choc going like f***ing roll of dice.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** What whiskey are you drinking, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Is that Vinny?

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:03]** This is actually one of the rare occasions where I'm actually drinking the liquor that's on the cup.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** This is Jack Daniels bottled in Bond.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:34]** bottle and bottle I don't often drink Jack which is funny because I have like two or three bottles of it but yeah it's good it's funny I was talking to somebody yesterday where like as a younger person we would just buy whatever we could afford and mix it with anything to make it drinkable and now as a real adult I'm like if I buy a bottle and I can't drink it neat I'm so disappointed

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Yeah.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It's not worth it.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** Drinking it mixed is the consolation prize.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** Yeah.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** So yeah, truly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:49]** I drink most of my stuff neat now, but yeah, I, I still don't like, and I think it's just cause I haven't had great liquor.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:59]** Um, I think the one thing I've ever been able to like sip and like enjoy was the rum that you guys sent me from, I always have to, I can't even, uh, continent.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Yeah.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Um, that stuff is good.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Do you see,

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:07]** I will say that Jack Daniels, though, Jack Daniels was trash growing up.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** I never liked it.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Again, it was a mixed drink.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:14]** You pour it into Coke or something just to get drunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** And so there's levels of Jack Daniels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Right.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:29]** And this is what I was going to get to was I went to Nashville one time to visit my wife's friend, and she surprised me with a trip to the Jack Daniels distillery.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:35]** Um, and it is still, I've been to a lot of distillery tours, a lot of brewery tours, and it was by far my favorite.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** It still is.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:40]** Uh, cause they do it the exact same way they did it a hundred years ago.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** They've only, I think they've doubled their size, but like they're still doing the same process.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:47]** They still have the original tanks that are still operating.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** They still pull the water straight out of the mountain.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:55]** Um, cause it's, it's something special about the limestone or something that is, is in that area.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** Uh, and, uh,

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:26]** And the coolest thing about it was they explained the different levels you can get of Jack Daniels and how they have the seven-year barrels are perfectly rotated a certain way within their warehouse because in the warehouse they're stored for seven years and the warehouse cools and warms but the ones on the upper levels get a lot hotter in the summers and don't get as cold in the winters and the ones on the bottom get much colder and not as hot.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:36]** So they, that actually determines how much the liquor actually permeates through the wood and back in, gives it that flavor.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** And so, yeah, depending on where it is in that warehouse.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:50]** So if you do your own special choice blend, you could choose like, I want a barrel that's always been at the top, or I want a barrel that's up, down, up, down, or I want a barrel that's rotated or whatever.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** Yeah.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:53]** It's, or you could actually get mixed from multiple ones and,

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:01]** So yeah, there's so much more to the hard, hard alcohol that I ever understood and appreciated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:09]** But yeah, we should, uh, we should buy a, I think you can buy a case and like get your own barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Like you can aim on it.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** You can buy a barrel.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** It'll usually, I think it's either 30 or 50 depending on the, whether it's a 15 or 25 gallon barrel.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:23]** Um, and yeah, they'll bottle it for you and slap your sticker on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:31]** John, like, Lagavulin, like, it tastes like it's been in a house fire in a way.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Like, it's really, really smoky.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** But, like, it's so different from any other whiskey you've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** It's been in a house fire, but in a good way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:48]** Actually, it's still an acquired taste for me, but it's something I want to keep exploring because it's so different that it's worth trying for sure and keeping at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Yeah, I like it.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** There are other smoky ones.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** You should definitely enjoy the Lagavulin.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:57]** Ardberg is, I think, the final boss of smokies.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Ardberg?

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Ardberg, yeah.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** Ardberg is literally, they just put a fire...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:30]** just bottled the smoke that's all it did I should say off the record we should go to Caltech they have a whiskey bar they have like all of these whiskeys that we've just described we do need more off the air we'll save hangs for sure just mention them casually they will be at our location come find us at Caltech come find us at the Rathskeller cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** Well, I'm glad I got to distract you just a little bit.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** But it's time to get back into it.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Let's play.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Let's play.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Yeah, let's play.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Yay.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Oh, come on.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Get some excitement here.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** This is intense combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** This is real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** This is going to be hard, man.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Life or death.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Definitely death for some of us.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Definitely death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Definitely death.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** Also, just remember there's undead immunities, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** Yeah, yeah, Rolu messed that up for sure.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Wasted it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** All right, so last time you discussed what you saw before.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:13]** You saw all sorts of things, ghosts walking the hallways and stuff, which you found.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:20]** But you decided to explore the smaller rooms before proceeding into those big doors at the north side of the map.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:26]** Uh, the first room you went to had a shocking surprise, a computer charged full of electricity.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:31]** And as Chuck touched it, it exploded and got Rolu and Chuck, they got hit and hurt pretty bad.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:39]** Um, but Chuck was still able to pull some information from that computer, including an email to Vari eight from a Dr. Swinney.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:48]** Uh, then you moved on to the next room, the study where Tremé found a statue of three deities that have come together to form Treyu.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Uh, and then he became confused and hit himself with it.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:55]** Out of concern, Thaddeus and Rolu charged up to try to stop him.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** Couldn't get away from him, but then he came out of it.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** And as that happened, you guys heard a noise.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** So Chak decided to jump right into it.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** And by it, I meant the space between two competitive ghosts.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** And they strike Chak down.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** So Chak is unconscious in that room.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:17]** And Rolu stepped up and took a hit, or almost took a hit as well.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Two things happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:43]** uh chuck you should have rolled for confusion um but you're dead so it doesn't matter um hang on no because i i very explicitly edged around the bottom of the room like climbing across tables to stay yeah yeah no no it's uh it's actually a 30 foot radius oh wow beaming out from each of these both of these creatures so he's confused and dead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** Well, you would roll a will save on that.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** So maybe we'll handle that when you wake back up.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** That's a good question.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:55]** So it says once per 24 hours, but if you die and come back, does that reset that timer?

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Just curious.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** I'm going to vote no.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah, I think no.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:09]** The other thing is these creatures strike EAC, and I forgot that, but I'm pretty sure that still wouldn't have hit you, Romu.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** No.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** Cool.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** I think we are ready to get back into it.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Time to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Thanks, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** Is that too foreboding?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Don't get ahead of yourself, Kevin.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Treme, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:29]** So I'm no longer confused, right?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** No.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** Because I already suffered the effects, so I can't be confusing it.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Got it.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** Oh, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** Whoa, slow down.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Sorry.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** I did load this up.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** I didn't want to forget.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:47]** I think this is from another AP, but it's just super cool because the artwork from Starfinder is amazing.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** This is what the other creature looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** That's not fun.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:59]** It looks like Whoopi Goldberg.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** What?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** To me, it looks like Whoopi Goldberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** Yeah.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Google Whoopi Goldberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** Like if she were a cosmonaut and then her helmet broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:14]** It has the same long dead arms with the long nails, but it's just in a light outfit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** It has the same ghoulish... Tendencies?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** Tendencies of Whoopi Goldberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** It really reminds me of... JK, I love Whoopi Goldberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:36]** For all of those Whovians out there, this reminds me of one of the first David Tennant episodes where they come across the shadows in the library.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** Shadows in the library are scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:54]** all I gotta say is I think if this were to be made into a movie Jared Leto would play the part and he would do like full method acting and go I could see Jared Leto doing this though go into the drift and disconnect his body from his soul would absolutely slay this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** 100% also would be, but you know, it's fine.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** I think he plays an Oscar at this point.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** Probably does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Not, not for the Joker though.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** That's a whole nother discussion.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Treme, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:15]** I'm going to cast stumble on this, uh, chick over here and, and move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** Uh, what, what kind of effect is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:31]** I just momentarily... I think it's galactic magic, and I momentarily transpose the position of the limbs of the target to interfere with his perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Is it a fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** It's a reflex save.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** A reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Okay.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:44]** I'm just trying to see you feel like there's something I feel like it's so basic that I can't be Yeah, it's just their movement.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, all right.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** What am I rolling again reflex nice try Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** DC 13 it's pretty low, huh?

**[00:16:52 - 00:17:02]** But maybe just maybe oh that that that worked You were off target

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** Okay, nice.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** For one round.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** And you can only move half your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** And off target does, I can never remember.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** I have the conditions pages up too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** Minus two penalties to attack rolls.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** That's it.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Okay.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** But super good.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Love that.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Love that.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** It finally worked, Will.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Finally.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** You know what?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** It finally worked.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** Finally.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Finally.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** We've tried so often.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:35]** It finally worked, but then we're going to get somebody telling us, by the way, that doesn't work on Undead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** On Undead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Damn it.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Uh, cool.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Okay.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** So you, you stepped forward and did that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:47]** I mean, I wouldn't, if I could, I, I assume I need the line of sight in order to cast this against the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:52]** Like it should say it doesn't, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:52]** Okay.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** It's a cantrip.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:19]** all right cool uh that's your turn moving on it is now dude gotta find the right tab thaddeus you're up thaddeus just like sighs himself he's like ah i can't see a thing so i'm gonna retreat and he can't like we're gonna draw them out i can't move past ideas yeah please draw them out he's gonna like back up a little bit to give them room this is not a tactical retreat kevin as he was smiling as he was swinging his water

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** And he's just going to like ready his gun and like hold it out forward.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** He can't, I'm guessing, do checks on what they are at this point.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** So he's just going to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** And are you actually readying an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** I am going to ready an action.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:35]** As soon as one of them peeks their ghoulish head around the corner, he's going to shoot them in said head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** Okay, so you are readying an action to shoot.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Yes.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** And that is going to move your... That's fine, whatever.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Your initiative order.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:50]** I'm confused, though, because you're kind of at the bottom of the... I'm at the bottom anyway, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** You'd be at the top if they move out.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Okay.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Okay.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:58]** It just puts him wherever the action would be.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:04]** So if it's at the end of my turn, it would just be whenever that is.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Or end of Chalk's turn, or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** It's also assuming the trigger happens.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** If it doesn't happen, he just stays where he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** But if the trigger doesn't happen before his next turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:18]** If the trigger doesn't happen before his next turn, then he's just a waste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** But he's not going to move up in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:23]** He would only move up if the trigger happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** If the trigger happens, then he'll move up in initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:32]** He'll move to where that initiative... From the bottom to the top of initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** I'm starting a timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:37]** I'm trying to just explain that it's... We've done this so many times.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** We've done this so many times, yeah.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** I don't know, though.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:46]** I feel like it's when the action happens, wherever that is in the initiative, that's where he ends up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Yes, and it's either before or after that.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** If it's defensive, it's before it.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** If it's offensive, it's after it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Yeah.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Okay.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** All right, cool.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** So that is your turn there, Chuck.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** You're up.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** No, I'm not.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Yeah, he's not.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Sorry, I forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** So I guess I'm going to burn a resolve point to stabilize.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** That's about the only thing I can do.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** That's the wise thing to do.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** And I'm not rolling that wisdom check.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Yeah.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:13]** Yeah.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** I'm going to spend a resolve point to stabilize.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** You're not going to roll the wisdom check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** No.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** He's innately wise.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** He only throws caution.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** He only just to live life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Oh, right.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** He does dangerous things safely.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Usually.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Sometimes.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Yeah.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** No, not.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** No, he doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** He's bored of being a politician.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** He wants to do crazy shit now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** Yeah.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** But deep down, he's a wise man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** YOLO.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** That's what his gravestone would say.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Sums you up perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:47]** Okay.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** So it is now the first creature's turn.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Is that the Lashinta?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** The Lashinta.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** Yes.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:57]** And she is going to strike Roloo.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** With a minus two.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** Okay, this is targeting EAC.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** There's a minus two, right?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Yep.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Does a 21 hit?

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** Yes, it does.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** That's with a minus two.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** That's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** All right, yep, hits.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Uh-huh, it hits.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** Okay, and that is going to be... 57.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** Seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** All right, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** So she strikes you, and then she's going to step back.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Where?

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Through the wall.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Oh, come on, dude.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** Just fades through the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I'm so.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** The wall.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Okay.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:45]** So is it the wall directly across from me or is it the wall to my right?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** So like down to the main room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** I think she moved down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** Okay.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** All right.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** I will tell you that Kelly hasn't shot yet.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** So that is an indication of which wall she went through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Okay.

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** All right.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** All right.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Cool.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Game the f*** on.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Let's keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** Okay, it is now Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** Okay, Rolu, I think a brief flash through his mind.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** He wants to use the planar phase.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** He realizes he has never used that spell before, and it's a spell gem, so he's not going to do that.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:28]** And this is me metagaming and saying that if I cast a spell, there's an AOO opportunity in which I will not cast a spell, and I'm just trying to get shock out of here.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:34]** And I trust my acrobatics at plus 11 more than I trust the ability of this creature to hit me.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Which it definitely will.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:43]** So I am going to try and pick up chalk-stabilized body, then acrobatics out of this room.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** I've looked it up.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** What will this even look like?

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** You're going to backflip out?

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** You're going to tumble?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Going to tumble.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Going to try and move.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** It helps now that this creature moved.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:01]** So the pickup, I think, is a move action if you look at manipulate an item in the Corgo book.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** So that's a move action.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** My question to you, Kev, is do I need to be in the same square to pick up chalk or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I'll say it's probably a five-foot reach thing.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I think you can lean into it and pick him up.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** But he is a small creature.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Is there a bulk limit on?

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Tiny creature.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** Tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Yeah.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** He's less than one cubic foot square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** I think we established that he's one bulk.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Yeah.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** From when we talked about him riding on people's shoulders.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Yeah.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Okay.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** I'll allow it.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Okay.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** So it's a move action to pick him up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** Yes.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Okay.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Okay.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:50]** So I think Rolu seeing this creature, seizing the opportunity of this creature floating back into the wall, quick, efficient movements as he tries to like kind of slide down and extend his leg out and grab shock as a move action.

**[00:23:52 - 00:24:03]** Then, holding shock, I'm going to try and acrobatics my way, tumble back out past Treme and avoid an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** When you're tumbling, you can move half your speed, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:10]** Yeah, or I could take a guarded step, but then I would be in the same square as you, Treme, which I can't do.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Yeah, you can't do that.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Okay, so I need to tumble out.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** And what is the DC for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** It's 15 plus one and a half.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:24]** The creatures that drift undead creature, uh, CR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** Hi.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:28]** I thought I had a calculator for this.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Why don't you just tell us the CR and we can help you.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** I don't want to.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** I got, I have a DC for you.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** Okay.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** You do.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** All right.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Well, that's, uh, that's how this works.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** I have a plus 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** Nice.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Pretty good.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** No problem.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** You kind of reach down.

**[00:24:49 - 00:25:00]** You have two hands swipe up poor little Choc's body and the other hands are already reaching to the floor as you just kind of do like a Capoeira spin kick thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:07]** And you clear, Tremaine doesn't even move, but you clear his head and kind of land right behind him.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** And then you can keep moving.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Wow.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:16]** Yeah, I think I'm going to just take an extra five foot step back from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Make sure you take Chalk with you.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Where's Chalk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Yeah, I can't grab Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Chalk, move yourself.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Move your dead body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Yeah.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** And then I will try and give you an elixir or something.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Lifeless.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** Unconscious but full of life.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Cradled in one arm.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** All right.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** That's it.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** That's two move actions.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** Make a turn, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** All right.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** It is now the other creature's turn.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** And he just saw you guys dart away.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** And he swipes at you as you move but completely misses.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Then it's going to step up.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** and you can just feel it.

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:01]** The ectoplasma is just kind of dripping onto your beautiful robes there, Tremei.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:07]** Get the f*** away from me, you slimy beast.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** I love hearing him curse, Tremei.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** I know.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:12]** It's a rare but beautiful thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** A 17 against your E8.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Oh, that hits, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** Oh, wow.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Yep, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** EAC is low, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** Seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Seven points.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** Seven.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:29]** Seven.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Seven.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Okay.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** Dude, Snakeboy's got to reprise his role at some point.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** Just saying, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** Seven.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Oh, over the intercom.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** I brought some more theories for you.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** That'd be great.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** He could just drop it.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** So many specials available soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:51 - 00:27:20]** it's just like the local radio channel my favorite by far okay so that is the end of that turn Torme you're up what's going on son of a gun this is not fun I guess Torme is going to so to no wait I think I have grenade proficiency so I can just use one right oh good good good good escalated it I love it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Okay.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** I have no idea where this is going.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** Right?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:31]** You were standing literally within like five feet of this creature and you're going to try to throw a grenade at it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** Yeah, I'm going to take a guarded step back into this other room.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:44]** And then can I, well, I guess my thought is like, is this door closable?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** And can I close the door and toss a grenade in and then take a step back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Probably not in that order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Right, because it's a movement to step back.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** It's a movement to shut the door.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:00]** And I believe it's also a movement to pull a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:05]** I think because I'm grenade proficient, it's not a movement to pull a grenade.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Is that true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:13]** Yeah, if you have at least plus one in any base attack bonus, pulling a weapon is a free action as long as you move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** And I also am proficient in grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Yeah, so you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** I expect you could probably chuck the grenade in and close the door, but I don't think you could also take another move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** That's what I'm going to do then.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Because... Justice from the grave.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Yeah.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:34]** So I'm going to... Is this door operable?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:42]** Can I get for free perception, see if this door will withstand the blast and protect me from a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** I'm going to say sure, yes.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** It looks like a sturdy enough door.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** You could probably trust it.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** I'll allow this to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Okay.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** This is what's going down.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:59]** I'm going to toss in my grenade just right behind him.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** And hopefully this works because I don't know.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** I'm going to throw in the let's go with a barbed shrapnel grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Actually, no.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Can I take that back?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** I'm going to throw in my frag mark, too.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:42]** frag mark two mark two frag bro wow we'll see if this works wow so i just i have to roll to hit the square right yeah ac5 yeah it's ac5 oh perfect okay that hits so it's landing in this sort of back part of the room and then i close the door 15 foot radius yeah

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:54]** The radius is 20 feet, but because the door's closed, I'm guessing it would concuss and keep in the room, right?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** What's the structural stability of this area, Kev?

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** That is a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Yeah, there is a thing.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** I'm not looking that up.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** I think you kind of work them together.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:14]** I'm going to give you that where you pull the door shut, but you actually click the grenade, and as you're tossing it, you pull the door shut, but the creature's in the way.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:19]** except for the door passes right through the creature as you slam it shut.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:28]** And then you, you just kind of brace yourself and you feel that as it just explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Okay.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** So I rolled for damage.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Maybe you can roll for damage.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** Yeah.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** Okay.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** So I don't like the way that sounded.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** I know.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Yeah, I don't like the way that sounded either.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** You could do that completely pointless thing.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** One could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Roll for perception.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** There's no traps, but roll for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:52]** I am going to roll for perception myself on Kev and send him motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:00]** I think instead of rolling perception, you should probably roll like a life science or mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Probably not a life science because they're not alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Mysticism check.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** I got a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** What was your damage?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** Tell me your damage.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** I told you eight points.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Oh, I didn't hear that.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Okay.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** So eight points of damage.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** I'm typing it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** Wow, look at how fast Kev is typing in that damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:32]** Okay, so... I rolled a 23, sorry, again, on my mysticism check.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Can I get anything for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Yes, you did this as you were shutting that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:41]** Yeah, as I saw his hand pass through the door, obviously, it piqued my interest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:49]** Yes, and you know that these are drift dead, and drift dead are formed when a living creature dies within the drift.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** While consumed with their strong negative emotions.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** But they remain here for some unknown reason.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** So with that, I will tell you, they are incorporeal.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:10]** And with incorporeal, it means they are immune to all non-magical kinetic attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** Energy attacks and magic kinetic attacks deal half damage.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** And then, oh, yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:26]** So you can only really get full damage with force effects and incorporeal effects.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** So there are some skills that let you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** So this is half.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** I got half damage or I got no damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:37]** You got zero damage because you said it was a kinetic grenade, right?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Yeah.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** Force spells and effects.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** shrapnel shot right through this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** No, it's frag.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** It wasn't the shrapnel grenade, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Either way, it's a kinetic energy, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** I wasted a Mark II.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Or is that an energy weapon?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** Because I guess it would... I mean, it's... No, it's kinetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** It's kinetic energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** I don't know.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:01]** Would Tremé be so gracious as to let us know that this is a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** Yeah.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** He doesn't have time to tell you that.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** His turn is up.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** No.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** You all know that now.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Except for Chuck, who's dead.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Yeah.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** You're not dead anymore.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** You're stable, so you're still hearing things, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:15]** Rolu is whispering into your... I mean, he's unconscious.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Hey, so that's the Drifted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** God, he's going to try to Inception him while he's there, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** So Thaddeus, you are up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:30]** All right, so Thaddeus is just going to be like, well, that's unfortunate.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** But then he's going to take out his Flame Dosh.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:39]** And he's just going to do a Darth Maul spin where it's like... And then it goes... And lights up.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** And you just see the hallway turn orange around his body.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** And he's going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:49 - 00:34:18]** sorry drawing a weapon he did that so now he's going to uh advance generally in the direction of where these incorporeal beings are but he can't he can go through all right he's gonna step in front of rolu behind termay and i don't think he can attack because he no the door's shut moved right yeah okay well yeah okay so that just just to be clear the dashco does fire damage that is considered energy right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** So that should work, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Right.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Okay, I'm just making sure.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** I'm just making sure myself.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** It's a complicated fight.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** Cole, okay, so that is your turn.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:35]** I'm going to burn another resolve point to get one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** There it is.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** To stay in the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Stay in the fight.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Get Shaq out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** One expend points.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** One hit point.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Cool.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** So he's alive, but just barely.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:58]** He wakes up and he feels that he's in a creature's arms and is being carried.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** And he's like, oh, this is nice.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** I like this.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** And then he wakes up and sees Rulu's face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** He's like, oh, f***.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** You also smell sandalwood.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Yeah.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:15]** Is that the Bath and Body Works collection?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:25]** He like rolls out of your arms and like stumbles away from Roloo.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:40]** Cause like he remembers the, the last thing he remembers is the faces of these, um, this beautiful Lushinta turning to skeleton and like trying to murder him.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:48]** He's like, this is a weird place.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** I need to get out of here.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Good call.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** I'm worried about you.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I mean, it's good he's getting away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:05]** What he doesn't know is that the Lashunta phased through the wall and is likely in the hallway waiting for his exit.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** But sure, I don't want to tip Kev's hand on his own behalf.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** I don't like Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** All right.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** It's now that drift.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** It's actually that drift has turned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:27]** I feel like we were all paused because we saw Chuck get up, and we're all like, Chuck's okay, and start to run away.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** It phases back through the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** This is pure nightmare fuel for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** Absolutely.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Oh, my God.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:45]** I am going to roll a D6 to determine who it goes after.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** You stop it, Kev.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** You want high or low, Chuck, or odds or evens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:57]** I want even, and I rolled whatever check I needed for the totem, and I got 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Okay, cool.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** So you passed your will save, you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** You said which one, odd or even?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** I want even.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:10]** So it phases through the wall and walks right over to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Okay.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** Cheese and crackers, my guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** And I'm going to take a strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** I am going to use chronomatic defense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Ooh.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Oh, what's going on over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:35]** As a reaction, when an attack is declared but before the result is known, you can use a paradox to grant an ally an insight bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Nice.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:40]** So I'm going to burn one of my paradoxes, and you get a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:40 - 00:38:05]** two bonus to your AC at the moment with the clutch precog ability let's see if it works okay so that that uh off off target stuff is done right yeah okay uh that's a 15 to hit against your EAC and you have a plus EAC tie goes to the roller


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:17]** That's six points of damage.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** And check falls unconscious yet again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** No, dude.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** No, no, get him.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** This can't happen.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** No, he has one result point left.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Get him the f*** out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Why don't you read into that?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Rolou, you're up.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:33]** Rolou is internally screaming because he was about to give shock.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** A serum of healing.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Oh, my God.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Okay.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** So I need another drink after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** You got time.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Can you heal him?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Can you do something?

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Good Lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** You guys have not done any damage to these things yet.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Not a single thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Yeah.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Thanks for reminding us.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Thank you for trying to save Chuck.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Yes.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** Yes, I can stabilize him, but only heal stamina points.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** I need to get to him to heal his hit points.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Do it.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Do it.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Do it.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:11]** I'm going to cast stabilize as a cantrip and on shock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** What's the range on that?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** 30 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Waiting for this to load.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Yes.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** It's 35 feet.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Okay.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** Instantaneous.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** He is automatically stabilized.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Great.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** That is my standard action.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** And then, you know what?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** It worked once.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Let's see if it works again.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:39]** I'm going to try and move and tumble through the creature square to get to the other.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:42]** Well, I'll just move up, actually.

**[00:39:42 - 00:40:01]** into the threatened square because it's five feet away uh i'm gonna move up to this creature and i'm gonna actually i'm gonna take five step forward straight and then five step diagonally up so that way there's still line of sight on this creature but i'm within five feet of shock so i can but you are leaving a threatened square as you do that

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Does it have 10 feet reach?

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Right.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:09]** So when I step forward five feet and then I'm going to step forward up into the left five feet.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** So that way this creature.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** Yeah, I don't think you're doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** You're doing a diagonal.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** He's doing this.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Yes.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Yeah, I'm doing a diagonal step.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Because you moved right next to them at first.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** So if you would have moved up from there.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** And then I realized that I would be blocking everybody else.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:32]** As you do that, you're kind of sidestepping this creature and you kick over that tree and statue.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** I'm going to need you to roll.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** You don't have to roll anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Come on.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Sorry.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** It explodes.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yes.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** The whole Stellar Flare explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** All right, Rollo, you are done there.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** It is now the other creature's turn.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** And it is going to phase through the wall this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Oh, God.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Oh, wait a second.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** I just closed that door.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** How'd you get here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** And it's going to step up.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** And I'm going to do another D6 to see who... No, it's going to attack Treme.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:17]** Because you are what threw whatever you threw at it.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** That's a 15 EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** I believe that hits.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** Yeah.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** That is eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** I'm super low, guys.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Oh, dude.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Dude.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** I know.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** We're all low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** All right, Termay, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** Kelly, you need to do something.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:48]** Termay, seeing this now creature do these things, can I potentially go through him?

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** I'm going to say you take an AOL if you do that.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Okay.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** And I can't take... Can I take a... If I were to take a step back into this room...

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** I don't have line of sight on him anymore, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** No.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** And that would be a guarded step unless you want to take an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** That's what I mean.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** It's a guard.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Okay, fine.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:15]** So I guess, and I don't have anything to melee attack him, so I have to cast a spell, which is going to do an AOL anyway, right?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Yep.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:19]** So I might as well just get out of the way and take an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:25]** If you do a guarded step and then take an AOL from, you'd have cover and then they don't want to get AOL on you.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** So you could do a spell from inside that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Right.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** But I don't have line of sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** All right.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Right.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** Or can I, you're saying I can cast from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** It depends on what you're trying to cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Well, the only thing I can cast really is like overheat.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:48]** So could I cast overheat into this area diagonally through the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** I'd say yes to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** I think, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:59]** That's what I'd do then.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Stand back, guys.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** That'd be a good question for... I mean, yeah, take a screenshot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** I feel like people could argue that either way.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** John, what are your thoughts on that?

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Vinny?

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** I think he could very easily lean into the doorway and cast it like that.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Yep.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Like, practically speaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** Yep.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Okay.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** There's no rules about cover on it either.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** So, okay.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** I'll allow it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** All right.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** I'll allow it.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** I take a guarded step and I cast overheat.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Okay.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Okay.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:34]** So I collect all the heat that exists probably from the next room where we all got fried or most of us did.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:39]** And I direct a thermal wave towards this ghoul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:40 - 00:44:05]** and i get a save of some sort yeah you get a i believe it is a dc14 fortitude safe yes or three plus sr or whatever i don't know three that's against spell resistance you don't need to worry about that okay it's dc14 yeah it's a reflex or fortitude reflex reflex okay for half right okay yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** Yeah.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** I got 10 for reflex.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Nice.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Oh, wait.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** I rolled the wrong dice.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Sorry.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Ooh, 1-8 and a 7.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** That's 15 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Nice.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** 15 points divided by 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Yeah.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** 14.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Sorry, 7.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:27]** It's fire damage.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Yeah, it's fire damage.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yes.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** So it passes reflex save, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** Energy damage deals half.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** So it's seven points of damage.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Wait, I'm actually frustrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Against whoopie?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** But it's magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Yes.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** So kinetic attacks do nothing.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Magic and energy attacks do 50%.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:58]** The only thing that actually does any true damage is a force attack.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** It has to specifically say a force attack, like mind thrust or something like that.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** Or if you have something that says it can attack incorporeal creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:11]** I was about to say, I don't even think mind thrust would work because they're undead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** There's no mind affecting, yeah.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:19]** So, yes, it has to be a force ability or it actually deliberately says it can attack.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:26]** So I think there are things like, I think there's a fusion called ghost killer that gives you the ability to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** Magic missile affects them normally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Well then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Okay.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** That's good information.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Yeah.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Magic missile again for the win.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:41]** Oh, you know who has a weapon that has the force descriptor?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Chalk.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** Well, now that we know this, let's kill these things, huh?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Okay, that's Tremay's turn.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:46:02]** I may be miscalculating the likelihood of full attacks being disadvantageous in this case, so I just went for it.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** Because I don't know how high their EAC or whatever the f*** is.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** So then I'm just going to do a regular attack.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** I rolled that.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** It's an 18 to hit.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** An 18 does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** And it's 5 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:39]** okay she's like stabs like those like fiery prongs into the side of that broken helmet so wait a fire attack is a is an energy attack yes but that's a that's a melee weapon so it still attacks kac or is it attack eac it doesn't matter if it's fire damage it's uh oh but you're asking like what what is it going up against uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** What AC are we targeting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** I mean, it doesn't matter in this situation, but I'm just, you know, for future texts.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** I don't know.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Let me see.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Moving on.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** You want to do anything?

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** It's your turn.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** Are you going to step back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** There's nothing really to figure out more about these guys.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** We know pretty much everything, right?

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** I mean, you can roll more.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** All right.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:03]** Well, he's going to shout at Rolu and just be like, really, really, really need to get Shaq out of here.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:12]** And if you can pull that creepy, particularly creepy looking one away from us, I think that Tomei and I could finish this one off maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** I'm almost dead, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** All right.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Top yourself off.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** Come on.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:20]** I'm getting pretty woozy over here, guys.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** I don't know.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Dang it.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Right.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** Worst case, it's okay to run away.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** You know this, right?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Where are we going to run?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** That's really bad.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** These things go through freaking walls.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** We'll try to get through those double doors to the end of the hall.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** I don't know.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Just kill it.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Just kill it.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** All right.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** We'll try.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** We'll try.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** Anyway, he's going to roll to try to figure out more stuff about it.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** What is this?

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Something like that?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** No, it'd just be, I think, mysticism.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** I don't have... Okay.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** I don't have... Identify creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** I don't... Yeah.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** I could do an acrobatics check.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** Maybe I could, like, flip really high and, like, see something on top of its head.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** Like a little, like, revealing thing.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** Literally all my skills are in acrobatics and athletics.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** I'm a cat, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** So you do a handstand and you can see through it.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** There you go.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Can I really find nothing else out?

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** What if I just do life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Is that a perception?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** These things aren't alive.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** I don't believe you can do life science.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** Okay, your life science tells you it's undead, and you already know it has undead amenities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Okay, so Chalk, what are you doing?

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:28]** Chalk is definitely going to start his turn, getting back in the fight, staying in the fight.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** I'm going to burn another resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** God damn it.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** How many resolve points do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Three, four.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** I've got one left.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** I've got four total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Don't do it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** I've got one resolve point.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** I've got one hit point.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:45]** Now, here's the kicker, because Chalk is...

**[00:48:46 - 00:49:07]** effectively underneath this ghoul so if he tries to retreat he's going to take a an attack of opportunity so i'm gonna roll this here d20 and it is going to dictate whether god no check jack pulls his asphalt blaster and fires


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** God.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** But that's a ranged attack.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** They're both attack opportunities, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Right.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Yeah.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** What's your force weapon that you said?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** It's the fast fall blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Oh.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Just play dead.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Just play dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Yeah, I was going to say, is there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Yeah, just play dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Don't be a hero, man.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** Don't be a hero, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Fine.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** Wisdom, I'm not going to roll it because I don't want Chuck to die.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** Call me selfish.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** I don't care.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** I would like to roll a bluff check to play dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Yep, it's called faint.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** So you can use your standard action to faint by attempting a bluff check.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:49]** The DC of the creature, 10 plus your opponent's sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** It's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** You pass.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Nice.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Does he need to roll out each time or is one good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** So check laying down on the ground.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Okay.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:08]** You hear a deep... And his eyes open.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** He sees the ghoul, but the ghoul isn't looking at him.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:17]** So he turns his leafy head toward the rest of his colleagues, winks, and then closes his eyes again.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** I love that.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** Thaddeus gives an approving smirk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:36]** Okay, it says you also get to treat your opponent as flat-footed for your next attack.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** That's awesome.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Threatened me with a good time.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:51]** All right, and it is now that Drift Dead's turn, so it doesn't even notice you move.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:58]** You were unconscious, you stabilized yourself, and then you went and fell and pretended to be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:02]** Strictly speaking, Rolu stabilized him, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** Oh, okay.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** Thanks for minimizing my roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** And so, Rolu... Rolled.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** This creature is going to move over one.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Yes.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Please.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** And strike you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** A-O-O.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Do you have a melee weapon out?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** I have my pincered elf in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:32]** I actually don't think that I would have because I had to pick up Chak with one hand.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** So being real, I don't think I have my staff out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** Here's a question.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** Would Chak know that

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:45]** Physical attacks have zero effect on these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** I don't know about that.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Roll wisdom.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** In the meantime, I'm going to attack.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** Roll loom.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** That is a 27.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** For five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:10]** I am going to use my safeguard paradox and burn my other paradox and not take the five.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Actually, scratch that.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** I don't want to use that right now.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** I'm going to save that Paradox.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** I take the five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** I want to know more about these Paradoxes, but we'll find out some other time.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** Okay, so you take five points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** Yeah, I decide to take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** And Chalk, do you want to try to strike?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** No.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Okay, I'll just play dead.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** All right, it is now Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:32]** Great.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Wonderful.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:42]** Is there space for me to step back, or is this the limit of the space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:45]** No, I'll say there's one more square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Yeah.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** For the listener, it's kind of like an isometric view a little bit, so it looks like there's a wall.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** All right.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** Then he is going to take a step back.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Guarded-wise?

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** Yeah, guarded-wise, as they say.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:09]** Raise his Venom, not Venomcaster, Serpent Laser, and take a shot.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Ooh.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Because this thing needs to take some damage.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:21]** And he saw Choc's wink, so he's going to try and pull this thing away, and hopefully Choc can move out of the way so he can do other stuff.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** That is going to be...

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Natural one?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** No, it's a 12 against ENC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** That is so close.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** F***.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** So close, but not good enough.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Moving on, that is your turn.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:48]** It is now the second Drift Ed's turn, and it is going to take a full round attack at Thaddeus.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** That's your name.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** I keep forgetting.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Okay, so...

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** I have to do math in my head and I hate it.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** 25.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** Does 25 hit EAC?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Yeah.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** All right.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** That is seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** You took the negation for your full attack, right?

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** The next one is a 20 to hit EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** For nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Okay.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** So in total, 16 points of damage, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Just claw.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Incorporate all creatures.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** After claw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Great.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** This is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** You saw how sharp their claws were in the picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:36]** Yeah, I mean, they get the salon part of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** That's the end of that creature's turn.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Termay, what are you going to do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** Can I quickly just recall...

**[00:54:45 - 00:55:13]** anything about so here's here's my line of thinking is there anything linking this incorporeal creatures to the triune statue ah could i do like because i did notice on there the the some of the character art there was like some robotic on there it looked like around like the neck and like the guy the astronaut dude you could do mysticism

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Yeah.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Can I do a mysticism check for free?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Okay.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Okay.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** That is 22.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** 22.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** So this is enough.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Let's see.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** I'll give you something else.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Let's see.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** There to hit is a plus 10.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:38]** and they strike with their claws using a 1d6 plus 4 of slashing damage.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:44]** They also have a second ability, which is a ranged ability, that is a plus 7.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** It's a 1d4 plus 2.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** I'm giving that because it is a knowledge check.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:55]** The other thing is, no, there is no connection to the statue itself.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** There is actually nothing with that statue.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:26]** the effects that you felt are the creatures they have an aura of confusion around them got it okay magic missile then yeah full round that's what I like to see let's get the d4 doing it come on two points on the first one okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** It's full damage, Kev.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Five points on the second one.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Nice.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** And five points on the third.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:43]** So you're standing in that room by yourself.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** And this thing is like lashing out at Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Yep.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** I hear the screams of horror.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:56]** I hear... I probably, like, see some blood splatter on the opposite wall that I'm, like, sort of ducked behind.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** You smell poop stains as Thaddeus poops himself.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** What did you just say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:07]** Don't you have the cannon in your way until, like, Thaddeus is... No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** That's not canon.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** Don't you do this.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** And, uh... I just... Yeah.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Fling out...

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Magic missiles, these orbs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:20]** I picture they come up and they just kind of wrap around your head.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:23]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:33]** And shoot out that door and around the corner and just bash this thing, one on the shoulder, one on the gut, and that last one strikes it in the head.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:38]** And the force of that energy...

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** strikes it in a way that almost sucks it out of the air.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:51]** It just, as it hits, it kind of blows with the wind as it just vanishes like a mist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Yes.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Yes.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** by Whoopi.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:03]** There's not a bed today who could take me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** I'll just delete it.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** It's gone.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Never again.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** In corporeal creatures.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** Vanish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** But we're not done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** No, we're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** Yet.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** Holy s***.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Do that again.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** That was my one shot, guys.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Sorry.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Are you fresh out of those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:25]** Yeah, unfortunately, unless somebody throws one at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:30]** Thaddeus is going to top himself off with a serum real quick.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** And hold on.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** I need to remember what those are worth.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Mark one healing serum.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** It's a D8.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** One D8?

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** To hit points.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** Gotcha, gotcha.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** Eight points.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Nice.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Yeah.

**[00:58:47 - 00:59:07]** nice cool nice and fresh so then uh he's gonna so that is a move action tension that was a move action yeah yeah i think it's he said it's a standard action it's a standard action to take a uh healing serum meaning i can't do anything else

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** You can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Yeah, you can move.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:14]** Okay, so a standard action includes pulling it out and targeting it.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** If you're doing it to somebody else, it's a full action.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** It's a full action, which is, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:28]** Thaddeus is going to, like, move down here, and then he's just going to, like, shout at, like, I don't know if this is going to work, but he's just going to, like, wave his arms wild and be like, here, come this way.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Just going to try to pull him from shock.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** I don't know.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:43]** It was lame role-playing, but basically he's just going to... I could throw something.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** He kicks a statue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** The statue's way over by Rolu, but I will let you do... Not an intimidation.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Would that be a bluff?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** I'll give you a bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Diplomacy or bluff to pull focus.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Diversion.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Diversion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** Bluff check.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:02]** You rolled a 13?

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** You really need some dental work, young man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:12]** I'm going to do, I'll do, is it supposed to go against Ys?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Yeah, that doesn't work.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:20]** She kind of gets her attention and then turns right back towards Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:26]** I can just imagine how creepy she looked when she did that too with her grin.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Blood falling out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Take a step back and let her rip.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** I'm reading the core rule book.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:43]** Can I see from the ground how the rest of the crew is faring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:49]** I mean, you can see Thaddeus for sure.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** You could mind link with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** What do you want to know, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Yeah, you also have comms.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** You could just talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:59]** Hey, I can talk into your brain without your lips moving, man.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** I don't want to freely give up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** I'm hurting, man.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Is this almost done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:06]** I don't know.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]** This thing's not taking much damage.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:17]** It needs force damage if you don't... Nothing works on it except... It's undead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** I've got one more move, but it's a Hail Mary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** Can you take a step back and do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]** If it doesn't work, I might be a goner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Don't put yourself at risk, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** You're not on this channel!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Don't do it.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** You know Thaddeus would say this to you, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:38]** Yeah, I mean, I could talk with Thaddeus.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:43]** He says to not do it, but it's up to you, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:48]** Tell him that we're nearly done with this.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** We can finish them off, and it's not a worthwhile decision to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** I think we can do it.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** We might be able to do it, Chuck.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** I don't know.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** All right.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Let's let the dice decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:59 - 01:01:59]** 50 or greater.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** No.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Yeah.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Hang on.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** I need D100.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** 50 or greater.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** He takes the Hail Mary.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** 49 or lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** He steps back and throws a football.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** He steps back into the pocket.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** It's an aught seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Dang.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:18]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** So, no.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** What is 49 or lower, then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** 49 or lower.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** He plays dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** So, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** So you're just playing dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** So says the dice.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Jack plays dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:32]** All right.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:38]** It is now... I don't even... I don't know what round it is.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** I haven't changed it.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:48]** The drift dead is going to actually step up against Rolu and strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** Yeah.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** I'm going to roll that again because my thing was off.

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** It looked like a 20, but it was correct.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** It's a 14 against your EAC.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:07]** Ty goes the roller.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:10]** Yikes.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** That is eight points of damage.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Are you down?

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** That's French for damage.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Close.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Still up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:44]** that's the noise that's done the nails make as they slice through your armor yeah roly what are you doing great great good stuff love this uh man i sorry i'm taking damage i'm at two hit points let's see

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:48]** I think Roland needs to give himself a serum of healing.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:48]** Yes.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** Another one.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** Yes.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** It's going to be a D8 as a standard action.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** I only got four, but it's better than nothing.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:06]** And then Rolu is going to... Because if I do anything, literally anything, I'm going to incur an AoO and go down.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** And I do not want to do that.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** I want to be up in the fight.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:16]** So I think Rolu is going to use tumble again to try and move past this...

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:23]** And actually, yeah, just get to the other side, closer to Thaddeus.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:27]** Let's try and leap over the data thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** Oh, you want to flank?

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:33]** Yes, yes, to me as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:35]** All right.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:42]** Brolu is going to, yeah, going to roll acrobatics to move 10 feet away.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** 19.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Nice.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** You pass.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:58]** I feel like he quickly stabs himself and then slides in between some server racks or tries to jump over the low thing and slide under the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:03]** With tumble, it's leaving a threatened square or passing through a threatened square?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** It's passing through a threatened square.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:11]** Okay, so you'll have to tumble to once to get out of where you were because you were adjacent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]** And then you're saying, I need to do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:15]** I'm asking.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** I don't know.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** I'd have to read it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** That's a good question.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]** Or is it just that you move entirely and don't take any?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:29]** Well, you definitely... If you're going through multiple threatened squared, then you have to do... But that's for multiple enemies.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:30]** Multiple enemies?

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** I thought it was multiple threatened squared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** That's what I think, too.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:33]** Let's look.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** Real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:38]** Tumble... If multiple opponents...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:41]** It goes up by two for every time.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** Okay.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:46]** If you move through multiple threatened spaces, yep, you have to succeed at a check for each base.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** And it goes up by two each time.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** So I need to roll it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** It says through a threatened square, though, not out of.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** I think that's an important thing to read.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:00]** So you pass through a threatened square, but you didn't.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:04]** So it wouldn't provoke the second time, right?

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Sure, take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:07]** Yep.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Sure.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Great.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** That's what I was going to say.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** All right.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:11]** All right.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** All right.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:12]** Great.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** Moving on.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** Drifted number two is dead.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:19]** Well, dead again.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:19]** Gone.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** Whatever.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** It's out off the map.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Termay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:28]** Termay is going to...

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** a creature.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:54]** So he starts focusing his sort of energy and he starts sort of meditating his eyes and his sort of aura appears around him and his eyes start to glow and from the ceiling above to the left of the creature I should say

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Right about here.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:07]** Sorry, down beneath the creature comes an Aeon from an extra plane of existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:08]** Amazing.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Define it.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** Aeon in this case, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** Well, it's spelled A-E-O-N.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** It's a tiny... It's an extraplanar creature.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** It's small.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:24]** Little one-level... Level 1 CR Aeon.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** It can't really do anything magical or anything.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:30]** Like, it doesn't have any... It has a melee attack and a ranged attack.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:32]** It can slam, which it might do.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:39]** But in the first part of its turn, it can communicate telepathically if the target has any language...

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** or has telepathy.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:45]** Can I communicate with this creature through the Aeon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:50]** I don't see why not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:51 - 01:08:00]** And, uh, I want to ask the, the, the, the drift ghoul, um, through the aeons voice.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:10]** So I would imagine it's this sort of like angelic heavenly voice, you know, like, like sirens or something like an organ playing.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:15]** It sounds like his voice and, uh, ask like, what is keeping you or what's keeping you here?

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:21]** In this plane of existence, why do you attack these people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:28]** You're going to have to roll me a diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** Okay.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:33]** 16.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** That's the creature's diplomacy, right?

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** The Aeon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** 16.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:45]** Uh, so the creature is where now?

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** It's just, what is it?

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** What is it on again?

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:47]** Define it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** Um, I don't know.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:52]** It's an, a tiny extra planar flying creature.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:53]** Is it like a orb of some sort?

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:54]** I'm just trying to picture it.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]** Um, I don't know what it is in star finder.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]** Listen, it's like a pixie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:06]** Hey, Hey, why are you, why are you talking about friends?

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Is it mindless?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** This is a mindless creature.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** What was that?

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** That wasn't the voice of the Aeon.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** That was just Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** Yeah, Kev, you good?

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:23]** That was the creature's response to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:24]** Okay.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:29]** Well then, the Aeon's just going to try and slam him then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:34]** That's a kinetic attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:35]** Let me check.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:40]** I think it's bludgeoning, so it's probably half or not at all, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** Not at all if it's a kinetic attack.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** Right, well, it can draw its fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Yep, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** That's the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** I like it.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** Thaddeus, what are we going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:55]** Do you want me to roll to hit and see if it's a successful slam?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** It doesn't matter.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:57]** You wouldn't be able to hit it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]** No, I wouldn't be able to do damage.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** But I can still hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** That is fair.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:04]** Okay, roll to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Yeah, I got a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:08]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:11]** And I'll roll for damage that don't matter.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** But I'm going to do it anyway.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:15]** For next time.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:16]** Dang.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:21]** Okay, so that would have been 8 points of damage if it were to go through.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:26]** This Aeon is next to this creature, right?

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:29]** Hovering above.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:31]** It's flying.

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:34]** Would that count as flanking, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** So flanking, you would have to get behind the creature.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** So you need to actually be on the opposite side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** I think Rolo is flanking.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:40]** Flanked.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** But don't you have to be like right next to flank or no?

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:44]** Yeah, it's melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:49]** So you both have to be in an adjacent square unless you have reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:51]** So you have to be here.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:54]** Well, that's not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:59]** But I will tell you that technically... Your alien is flanking.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:00]** Chalk...

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:03]** We'll give you flanking here.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Just for being chill and just for chilling there.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:06]** I like it.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:09]** He has an ability to threaten, technically.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:13]** He has a melee weapon out, so he's in the adjacent square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:19]** Shock is diagonal to this guy, and I can go up on the other diagonal, and then he'll be flanked.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:19]** All right, cool.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** Then he's going to do that.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** He's going to walk up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:39]** spinning his dash go epically like you have to be on this diagonal yeah you need to be up in the data server racks i can attack through those at this guy how they're it's actually they're more like desks so they're it's like you can just you guys waltz over

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** Do you really want, you can roll an acrobatics.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:44]** I just assume it's high enough that you're able to just like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:46]** I mean, I do like my acrobatics, but it's fine.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** I think I'm good.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:48]** It's not going to hit.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]** Take the win.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** Take the win.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** Yeah.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** I'm only, I only do a nine to attack though.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:56]** So it's not going to hit, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:57]** All right.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** That's the end of your turn.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:01]** Don't be a hero, man.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** It's fine.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** We'll take care of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:05]** Don't be a hero.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:05]** We'll take care of you.

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:11]** Alright, I'll give it one more round.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** I'm running out.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** Chalk is running out of restraint.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** He grows antsy on the ground.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:24]** But he will remain playing dead because he doesn't have to try that hard.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** He's almost dead already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** It's very natural.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** It is now the Drifted's turn.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:36]** is going to go... I'm going to do a d6.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** You want odds or evens, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** Let's go with odds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** Okay, he strikes you.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** Okay.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Or she strikes you.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:47]** That's probably good, though.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:49]** Keep fighting.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:50]** Kill if you must.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:52]** I'm playing with it over here.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:56]** That is an 18 to your EAC.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:57]** Yep.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** For eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:59 - 01:12:59]** Okay.

**[01:12:59 - 01:12:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:04]** That's the end of her turn.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** It is now Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:23]** Rolu raises his gun and takes a f***ing shot with his serpent laser.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:27]** I think he's going to do a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** He's going to do a full action.

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:32]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:33]** Okay.

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** Miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:36]** Seven again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:37]** Wow.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** Lucky number seven.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:45]** You're not sure if they're going straight through her or if they just missed.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:47]** Okay.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:49]** It is now Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:59]** All right, Tremaine is going to, let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:01]** You got any more of the magic missiles, man?

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:06]** No, I'm out of magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:13]** I would, but I don't got it.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:21]** And I guess, like, I'm trying to think, like, what he can really cast.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:30]** So we established that magical elements have, like, half damage.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** Half damage.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]** Yep.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:35]** Okay.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:38]** Let's do the old overheat again.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:49]** So I'm going to, Tremé's going to step up to basically like the sort of corner of the overheat radius, I believe.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** It's a cone.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:52]** It's a cone, right, yeah.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** And it goes out like this.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** I don't want to singe nobody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** It's a 15-foot cone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:59 - 01:14:59]** Yeah.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** Is that what it looks like?

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:02]** I feel like you would hit...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:04]** Yeah, you would hit Thaddeus.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** You'd hit everybody from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:07]** Yeah, they're literally all within.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:10]** That's why I have not cast overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:12]** You have overheat as well?

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:14]** Oh, well, let's just get the fuck out of the way and let you guys overheat.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** What am I doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** What about here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:21]** What's the range?

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:24]** Yeah, because it would taper off on the edges, right?

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:29]** Yeah, I would say if you shot straight towards Thaddeus, it would... Yeah, exactly.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:33]** It would stop right at Thaddeus and then, like, the wave of it to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** Yeah, so I'm going to move to this corner.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:39]** Is your Aeon also... Yes, the Aeon disappeared at the beginning of my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** It's only one round?

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** What?

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** You can only summon for one round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:43]** Yeah.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:43]** Okay.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** Because it's a level one.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:49]** I don't have level two summon creature yet, so...

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:51]** Probably won't live long enough to have it.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:56]** Anyways, yes, I'm going to cast overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:59]** So more heat.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** Let's see what happens.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:06]** We got 2d8.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** Okay.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** So you got 16?

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:12]** Oh, you're rolling.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:15]** So I got 12 points total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]** Alright, so that's six points of damage.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:21]** That's the first damage that this Drift Den's taken.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:21]** Alright.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:26]** It's so risky.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:31]** Like... Uh... Yeah...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:35]** Oh, are you trying to do a double attack?

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:39]** Because I actually double, I think, is the Dash Co.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:40]** unwieldy?

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:42]** Because you might not be able to anyways.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:43]** Really?

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** Hold on.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** It does not say.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** It does not say that.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** You're right.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Okay, you can do a double attack with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** Stop making problems with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** Just saying.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:57]** No, not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:58 - 01:17:00]** How's your spell cash going, both of you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** Mine is high.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:03]** I got a million spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:05]** Okay.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:10]** I have three out of four, but the problem is that the other ones I don't.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:14]** The max I could do really is six damage unless it's overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]** You could probably do something like overheat.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]** I think Thaddeus is going to take a guarded step.

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:24]** Can I take a guarded step over a desk or something away from this guy?


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:27]** I just want to get away.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** That way we can overheat him.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:34]** It just doesn't make sense for me to keep swinging away when we could deal so much more damage to him in spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:41]** Well, I mean, anything you're doing now is going to be the same as what his overheat is because it's half damage.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** So I'm just saying.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:48]** You can run away.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** That's really what you want to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:51]** It's kind of Thaddeus' thing.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:52]** Don't do this to me.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** Don't do this to me.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:55]** All right.

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:59]** I'll probably go down if I stay here.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]** Oh, that's different.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:01]** Okay.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:03]** I thought you were just like... It's both.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:04]** It's both.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** I'm going to get you for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:08]** You've dealt all of us a lot of damage, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:12]** All right, so anyway, Thaddeus is going to, like, try to get away, like, carefully.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:16]** So, like, he can... He can... What is it called?

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:17]** How do I get away safely?

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:19]** Garden step.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:20]** Yeah, there you go.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:20]** Garden step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** Garden step over here.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:24]** Where is over here?

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:24]** Five feet back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** Yeah, this way.

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:27]** Okay, there it is.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:32]** And then I can take... And then I can move for the rest of my, like, thing, right?

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:33]** Yes.

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:38]** All right, I'm going to get out of y'all's way so you can do your magic, like, literally speaking.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:41]** All right, hit him with the old one to you, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:45]** That's it.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:45]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:46]** Cool.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** Chuck, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:50]** Chuck grows too antsy.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:54]** He's going to take a guarded step diagonally down left.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:56]** Okay.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:57]** Create some space.

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:59]** Exactly.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:00]** Pull out his asphalt blaster.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:03]** And fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:06]** You have a base attack bonus, so you're able to do that while you're moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:10]** We all do since we're not level one.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:11]** I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:11]** I don't know how it works.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:12]** I've only ever played a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:15]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:16]** I had a BAB to begin with.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:16]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:22]** That's a 13 and a 17 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:24]** Do it, Jack.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:26]** They both hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:27]** Yes!

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:29]** Yeah.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:31]** Yes, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:34]** Force damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** It's force damage?

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:38]** So it's EAC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:40]** That is force damage against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:43]** Oh, my God.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:43]** Yes, dude.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:44]** So it's full damage.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:45]** Yes.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:50]** Chuck, I swear to God, if you take this thing out in one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:55]** That is six plus two, so that's eight points of...

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:58]** Whatever B is.

**[01:19:58 - 01:20:00]** It's a force weapon.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:04]** It does bludgeoning damage.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** Yeah, but it's force.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:08]** But it's force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:09]** So it's eight total?

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:10]** Yes.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Okay.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:11]** All right.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:14]** That's pretty good damage, but it's still up.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:17]** That's awesome.

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:18]** Amazing.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:19]** Let's go.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** Good round?

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:21]** Let's finish him off.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** Finish him off.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** It is now the Drift Dead's turn.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Say again, Chuck?

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:26]** Nothing.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:27]** Nope.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:27]** Nope.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:30]** I'm good.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:34]** Well, there are four of you.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:37]** And you've all done something to attack it.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:40]** And it is kind of right in the middle of all of you.

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:42]** So I'm going to do a d4.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** Starting Rolu is a 1.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** Thaddeus is a 2.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** Torme is a 3.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** And Chak is a 4.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:51]** It's going after number 3.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:53]** Lucky number 3.

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Which is Torme.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:58]** So he's going to... She is going to turn around.

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:01]** Because you were the one that did the overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:04]** which it didn't like.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:06]** So it's going to come down right in your face.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:07]** Yikes.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:10]** And do a slashing attack on you.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:11]** Please miss.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:13]** That is a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:16]** Dude.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:18]** Kevin.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** Well, obviously that hits, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:22]** Wow.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:24]** This might be the end of Treme.

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:24]** Yep.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:26]** I think that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:29]** We need to do it, Kev.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:31]** We need to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:37]** Blue Balls is the only trailer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:41]** We are so close to killing this thing.

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:46]** I think Trey's going to be okay, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:48]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:55]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
