**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** Unknown Traitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** Unknown Traitors.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:17]** Unknown Traitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** That's a nugget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:20]** There's a traitor.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Ward Smith over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** That's a title episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:28]** Dude, that is going to be a title episode.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Last episode title.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:29]** Done.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Calling it here.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** That'd be cool.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** That's actually really dope.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** All right, Kent, back to you.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Perfect summary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** I forget what I was going to say.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:40]** Okay.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:40]** Oh, no.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** We promised last week we were going to talk about trains.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Trains, trains, trains.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:49]** And then we were talking about how Vinny has never shotgunned a beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** That's true.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Or a keg stand.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Or done a keg stand.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I've never shotgunned anything.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** I've never done a keg stand.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Not a beer bong?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Nope.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** Man.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Oh, I don't think I've done a beer bong.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** We're just adding things to the Will Save Retreat to-do list.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** It's like built beer bongs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:07]** My friends actually had a 20-foot beer bong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** What does he get on a ladder?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Jesus.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** He was on the roof.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** He was on the roof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** I think he loaded with six beers.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:19]** That's crazy.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** It was dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:24]** I can never get down more than like

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:27]** one or two at a time, but I could do multiple one at a night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Very blurry.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:38]** See, that's what's tough for me, because if the goal is to get blitzed, I don't know, maybe I'm old, I'm going to go for some cask-strength bourbon.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Yeah.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** It's tasty, and it's like 140 proof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:45]** I can slug a shot of whiskey, no problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** I think the last time I shotgunned a beer... Yeah, I don't know if I can shotgun a beer anymore.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:54]** I think the last time I shotgunned a beer was at one of our tailgates before a football game.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** What was that, 2017, 2018?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Yeah, 2019.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:02]** Yeah, because 2019 hit and that was the end of the... Can I ask what kind of beer it was?

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** It was Bud Light or whatever craft beer they had.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Yeah, some natty-like thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** You drink the good stuff, you shotgun the bad stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** Yeah, that's the ticket, Vinny, is that you can't just do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** We also shotgunned White Claws.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Classic.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** I'm drinking one right now, but I'm not going to shotgun it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** What are you, a divorced mom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** I was going to say, you probably should shotgun it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** If anything, it should be white.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** They were new at that time.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** But they were new, but the moment that I tried them, I was like, aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:36]** This tastes like sunscreen and hitting on high school kids' friends.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:49]** I was going to make the connection of shotgun and the term shotgun, which is actually referring to when you call it for a car, riding shotgun, to trains.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** But it's technically not trains.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** It was actually more for carriages because Will gave me a funny look when I said that.

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:04]** But the term riding shotgun comes from the Old West terms of the person that was sitting next to the coach rider would have a shotgun.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, that was sitting shotgun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** Kev, you're talking to somebody who has literally ridden shotgun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** In a carriage.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Will knows about all that.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** I was a Pinkerton for many years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** But we were talking about trains.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** Last week I was talking about, and this is kind of fucked up, but kind of cool.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** It was a while ago.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** I don't know what a Pinkerton is.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** Christmas time I took Grayson to ride trains, and we did actually see the setup trains.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** You asked about gauges and stuff.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:36]** I think they were talking about, I don't know, zero gauge and double S gauge.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** And they were talking about it's one 64th versus three 17th or something.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:44]** And it was like, it sounds like he was talking about sockets, but tell us about your, your miniature trains.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** We'll tell us all about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:50]** So there are many gauges to miniature trains.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** I don't know all of them, but I have O gauge and I have HO gauge.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** So I have O and O gauge, as I like to say.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:04]** Oh, that's a good joke for like 1922.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** Yeah, it's a train joke for you guys.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** Model train joke.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:18]** No, my dad was super into it, and I had a neighbor who was super into it.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** That's cool.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:27]** So now I have a bunch of old locomotives and stuff from the 20s and 30s and 40s.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Oh, that's rad.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** I have some that still smoke.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:35]** You can put pellets in them and they smoke.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** That's neat.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** That's neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Like the same ones you put in your grill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** No, no, no.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** It's like, I don't know what it is.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:58]** It's just this little powdery disc that you put inside the top of it, and then it creates these puffs of smoke for a few hours as the locomotive chugs along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:12]** yeah so cast steel it's like it weighs like 15 pounds did you did you pull them out at christmas time and put put some train around your tree oh we did that's cool yes that's neat did we had the uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:29]** that has that like very tom hanks feel yeah yeah we so we had like all the little models it has that like very distinct like uh ozone flavor that that or smell that electric like burning smell what yeah yeah i know i know the air i love that smell actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:49]** My next-door neighbor at the apartment that Lauren and I lived in when we first moved in together, our next-door neighbor was a French guy, and his entire living room actually had a long 20-foot table that was IndyCar racetrack.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Oh, man.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** There were two controllers.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Each person pulled the trigger and raced your cars around.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** It's the same electric smell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** I've never raced slot cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** You've never seen those?

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** They're dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** Slot cars are awesome.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:10]** I had a neighbor back east who in his basement had everything.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** He had probably three or four miles of HO gauge track.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** There was a whole basement.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** He had like

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:48]** landscapes and like all kinds of you know figurines and land you know like uh terrain features and bridges and caves and all kinds of crazy that's cool all this stuff is like really cool i i love it and and the slot cars like i had those growing up but we had ones that were powered by light so then like you'd shine like a red light gun at them and then they would like go that way so you shoot the slot car what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:48 - 00:08:05]** yeah you shoot like a car and they move yeah it's like it's no it's just like a wide red flashlight and somehow that would work it was dope that's really fun your cars were cats

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:29]** their miniature cats driving the car that's funny amazing i love slot cars though they're they're great it's it's like a miniature version of the real life uh thing at disneyland right whether you have a anyway that racing ride at disneyland is slot it's like a giant slot car you actually drive it's kind of cool thing yeah i just i just don't have the dedication for something that involved


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** It's a lot of time investment.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Yeah, time and energy and money.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** To slot cars?

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** The trains are expensive though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** My next door neighbor, the one I was telling you about, his table was just like you were describing the trains.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:49]** It had mountains and tunnels and trees and a little village that lit up.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:54]** It was like your slot car was racing through the Italian mountains.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** That's rad.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** That's so awesome.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Wherever slot cars are racing in the real world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:04]** I think what we do, we as a podcast invest in a slot car track.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:14]** We make cars that are indicative of us as players or characters, and we race them, and we see.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:38]** humans i'm down this is what your patreon money will be that's what i think well i mean you're saying so a slot car has to be a slot card do you want to do pinewood derby pinewood derby oh box car yeah oh yeah pinewood derby man wow i'm in pinewood all right if you're listening to this and we know you are because if you're not you don't hear it um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:37 - 00:10:01]** slot cars trains pilot derbies pictures if you have them we'd love to see them throw up on our discord or on our our any of our other social media platforms we'd love to see them but i think it's really important that we are all here for a true reason and that reason is starfinder starfinder starfinder starfinder and i think we should play let's play let's play

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** So I'm going to take us back to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Okay.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** I'm going to give you a little rundown.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** I did not write this out like I normally do, so good luck with that, Kevin.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** I'm telling myself good luck.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Good luck with that.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** All right, so last time, we're back on watch, right?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:24]** You guys are prepping to go into the Solar Flare, so you each took a shift, and along that shift, you stood with either a goblin or an Akeshi.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:31]** Treme actually ended out the last episode, the previous episode before that, with his goblin.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** And then they chatted a little bit more.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:43]** Chalk took the next watch with a goblin named Torque and convinced that poor little goblin that the ghosts were going to get him.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:47]** And then played trick or treat and ding dong ditched the stellar flare.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Yeah.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:54]** That watch ended, and then Rolu took the stand.

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:07]** Rolu and Akechdi, they were out there standing watch, and they noticed these large prehistoric birds walking along the path.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** And luckily, they didn't engage.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:16]** I was prepared for you to shoot one of them, but they just wandered past and left.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:32]** And while all that was happening, Thaddeus actually moseyed over and woke up Torme and also caught the attention of Chak and pulled them aside and convinced them to work together to get something off of Rolu's body.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** And that's when Chalk was like, hey, man, I saw him take all sorts of shit.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** That dude's a thief.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** And so Chalk was like, fine, I'll do it.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:53]** And he goes in while Rulu's sleeping during the next watch and actually steals a parchment paper and the steel piece from the captain's quarters.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:58]** and that steel piece actually has the symbol of the stellar flare on it.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** And you recognize that on the door of the stellar flare.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** Just a little reminder, Kelly, tell us what was on that parchment paper again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** On that parchment paper was a map of the Leovara system, a star map.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:20]** which you will recall if you remember the transmissions between Rulu and Shira Dawnbreaker of the Names Revenge, was one of the star maps that Rulu had requested.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:33]** When you peel away that map, you'll see that there was a profile, like drawn profile of one of the members of the crew

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:42]** and the location of the member of that crew, the other cargo bay, the other cargo bay, not not the cargo bay, of course.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:56]** And that's that was part of which and then it had the title of the name of the ship that hears and his members of his crew infiltrated.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:01]** And thus, uh, you know, committed treason against the high council and against the pirates in general.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** So yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Beautiful.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** And it's actually Thaddeus who's on watch at that time.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:10]** So he, he's excited about this and he tells chalk like, yeah, this is it.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** This is what we need to get Rolu.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:20]** And then he rolls it back up and sticks it into his, his pocket and, and goes back and pretends like nothing happened on watch.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** And he goes out and he stands next to this little goblin.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** What do you, do you say anything to the goblin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Thaddeus is just high.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** He's so high right now on this whole experience.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:30]** Yeah.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Yeah.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Yeah.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:36]** So as we were saying earlier, and also, uh, what do you get up to around here?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Yeah.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:43]** He's just on, he's super chipper now coming back with extra energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Yeah.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** You know, they opened up the Stella flare.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** It's sorry.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** The great wreckage.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** It's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** What?

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Since when?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Since yesterday.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** You knew that.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I knew that.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Don't play dumb.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** I've had something or someone on my mind the last day and a half or so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Okay.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** Okay.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** That's fair.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** Go ahead.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:07]** Roll me a perception check.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Just me?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Just you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Oh, wow.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** It's not good.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** It's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:30]** rolled a five i wrote something for that too so you see something flickering in the distance you see the light you you look closer and you actually pull out your little monocle what

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:53]** you're looking at a telescope a telescope a periscope telescope telescope that's the word uh i didn't write that in here um and you look at it real close and that's you you have to it burns your eyeball a little bit because you realize it's the sun coming up between the junk mountains the sun is rising yeah that's that's what it does i don't it comes up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:59]** You should never look at the sun through a telescope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** He pulls out a full telescope.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:06]** He's got one of the really expensive ones.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:12]** But that's when you hear a loud clang behind you.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** And a couple of goblins, they're actually moving around a bunch of junk.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** And they actually move them near a familiar-looking pinkish keshdi.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** And that's when you see a large flame.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** Breakfast will be ready soon enough.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Aww.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** What's on the menu?

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Kvark dogs.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Oh.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** That's all we got around here.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:41]** And everybody starts to emerge from the tent, either from the smell or the light, whatever the case might be.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** It's morning.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** It's like you're camping.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** It's great.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Everybody starts to emerge from their tents.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** There's an excitement in the air.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:50]** Today's a very historical day for all of K'vok Depot.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:57]** And this group of goblins and Akeshtes will be witnesses to discovering what is inside the great wreckage.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** So Rolu, as you wake up, you feel uneasy.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Yeah.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** He had a nightmare.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** A weird dream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** Yeah.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** One hand as he sits up, pushes himself up.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:19]** The other just reaches on his back and feels a pain.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** And then that pain subsides.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:45]** and rolu just takes a deep breath and steps outside seeing this wonderful breakfast and realizes that he uh is not well liked so he doesn't

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:52]** He sits down and does a bit of reading before going over there, letting more people go over.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:55]** So it's not just him having to make awkward conversation with anybody else.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** He doesn't see Quirtle.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:02]** So he's going to wait until Quirtle comes out, the only person who he's made more of a connection with.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** His friend, yeah.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Yeah, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:07]** He found your soulmate.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Hey there, buddy.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** How you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** You look like you haven't slept very well.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** I didn't.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** I appreciate the sentiment.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** I didn't.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** But that happens.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** The bright spot was talking to you last night.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:26]** That was a nice respite from these bad dreams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** I enjoyed that quite a bit myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Good.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Should we get something to eat?

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** I haven't had this fare before.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Curious what there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** You ain't never had fuck dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** What do you mean?

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Fuck dogs?

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** You've been eating them all week.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Farting up the tent.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:45 - 00:18:04]** I'm trying to make an impression here I don't I didn't I didn't fart up the tent it's the smell that lingers after you come on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** Alright, so you guys enjoy your breakfast.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Rolu sits alone with his new Keshi friend.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:18]** The rest of you gathered in large clumps with the goblins and giggling, having a great time talking about what you think is inside this great wreckage.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:22]** Let's take you over to the map.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** The new map.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** The new map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** The new map.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:29]** Yo, you got that new new though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** Yo, that new map though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** Yo, that new map though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** A new map, though.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** Let's peel it away and see if there's any weird shit underneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Mmm, that new map smell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:51]** I am very afraid of this next bit, because I've never really used dynamic lighting before, so I'm kind of excited for it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** It looks really cool.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** I mean, it's the same artwork as before, but it's a giant map.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:03]** And we're standing at the very southern edge and the rest of it's blocked by, you know, fog of war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:06]** Now, I too am afraid, but for very different reasons.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Same.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:13]** Tremé's pacing at the mouth of this entrance, trying to peer in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:18]** Just a note, do not move your pieces without telling me what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:24]** All right, everyone, prepare for battle, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:29]** Yeah, so just for the listeners, this is the entrance to the Stellar Flare.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** And everybody is gathered around there.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:36]** There are almost a dozen goblins, including Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:41]** We got Zocket and Tork and Wurgberg.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** There's the Kestis.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:48]** There's Merc and Kesh and Cordal.

**[00:19:48 - 00:20:10]** and vari 13 as well as the rest of you um you're all standing around huddled but kesh kesh is kind of standing closest to the door and he's he notes that no one has gone inside um since they disabled the force field even though murk was incredibly eager to do so i i had to tie her up

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:35]** to the distiller unit with a rubber hose just to calm her down the acacia tells you i assumed you would want scavenger rights since you were instrumental in securing the area and merc looks a bit sheepish and makes a hero's promise makes you the hero's promise uh that they that you will bring her something interesting from wreckage

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Ah, fine, fine.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:41]** You first, but dibs on any shiny, zappy, pokey things.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Got it?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** And she smiles with a wide grin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** Of course.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:46]** Of course.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** I'm not agreeing to that.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** I'll keep an eye out for you.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** Don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:56]** Yeah, I really like both shiny and pokey things, but anything spinny, you're welcome to.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** All right, deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** So is there anything you guys want to do?

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** before you enter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Vahri, how are you?

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:07]** Well, one, how did you sleep and rest?

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:11]** And two, how are you feeling about coming in?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Would you like to come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** I am fine.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:20]** No, I am uncertain of what is inside of this ship.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:26]** I trust you, but I will remain outside until we hear word that it's safe.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** But I am very excited to find what is inside there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Vahri.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Classic Vahri answer.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** Next to Vahri's ear.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** Vahri.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** You can tell me.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:45]** Do you want to go in, but you're not because Kev doesn't want to play you in the ship.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** Just nod yes or no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:55]** She shakes her head and goes, you are a very strange creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Well, good talking to you, Avari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** See you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** Is this a sidebar, or is this like an open conversation?

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:07]** I mean, you could probably hear it and do selective hearing.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:18]** So Jack, I think, pulls up and is like, Hey, Avari, I think through your memories, you've probably got the most knowledge of this ship out of anybody.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:23]** Can I possibly convince you, or is it maybe written in a book somewhere that you can't join us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:28]** I'm just not certain that it is safe for me to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:35]** But if you were out here by yourself, wouldn't it be more dangerous than if you were to come along with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** I'm not by myself.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** I have all these goblins to protect me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** Can I roll diplomacy to try to convince her to come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I'll assist in that.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** I really want Kevin to have to play Safari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:53]** Also, I get a... Kevin hasn't said yes, so I haven't rolled it.

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:06]** I feel like I should get a plus two diplomacy to this for changing the attitude based on my experience for cultural convenience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:18]** So I'd have to review that, but I'm pretty sure Vahri is on the friendly level, so I'm not sure how much higher you can go on the likable scale.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** I'm not sure how much, like, what's a better way to put this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Friendly versus helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** Vahri is a level one NPC.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:32]** If you want them to come along, they are probably going to die.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** That's all I'm telling you.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** And that would ruin the entire adventure.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** We'll get our money.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** It's not safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** Didn't Vahri share in the same XP pool?

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** No, I guess not.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** No.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** No.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** They got like one hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:50]** No, because she never fought or did anything the entire time.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Well, you know, that's how some players are.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Except like one random shot.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Vahri, you're just a bump on a log, aren't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** Jack like pokes her in a couple of different places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:22]** oh yeah you are pretty squishy maybe you should stay you know you know i i can forgive varry for not doing things but michael i can't i can't forgive it michael should have helped yeah is there where is he by the way yeah do we have a cut scene of what he's up to michael i i don't know if you guys have seen goodwill hunting but it's it's that opening scene where they're fighting on the basketball court and ben affleck's like if


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** If you're not out there in two seconds, then you're next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** That's like, we're going to go whoop Michael's a** after this.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Yep.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Because he did not pull up.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** He is not a homie.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** True that.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Where is he anyway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** I searched the book.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:42]** I did a control F on the PDF, and Michael doesn't appear anywhere in this.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** Michael wasn't real.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Yeah, he doesn't exist.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Was Michael a ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Michael was a collective fever dream.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** Part of the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:14]** oh man these are all just a bunch of ai constructs that turn into spoiler alert uh starfish looking uh astrozone no okay so are you guys seriously is there anything is there anything that you can tell us that you think that we might need to know that we haven't asked about before going on this ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:18]** Is there any history or premonition that you might have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:27]** My visions are definitely of the Stellar Flare, but I can't piece them together to make any sense of what they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Hmm.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** All right.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Well, enjoy.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Well, fat load of help that is.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** Enjoy your kefalka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** Kefalka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** No, I wouldn't say that.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** That was very rude of you, Bobby.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Why would you say that to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** Aren't you paying us to go on this mission that we could die on?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Why would you say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** That was very rude, Bobby.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** I don't understand what you said, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** We've been nice to you.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:55]** No, that was... Says the guy who kicked a face down...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Right.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** I had a reason.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Goblin.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Okay.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** And then he looks around.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** I had a reason.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** Because Mom Guzzle messed you up, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** I was very upset.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** I did it for you, Jack.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** I did it for your heart, Chuck.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** No, I did it because I care about the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** What about my heart?

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Oh, really?

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Good guess, she says from the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** No, I definitely, yes, your heart's very important to me.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:25]** You only like me for my celestial body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** He's very magnificent.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** I'm not going to lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** Is that what we're going with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** Let's circle back to that later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Alright, so you're going in.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** Oh man, I've got a very busy week ahead of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** I can't stay.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Look at the time.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** I'll call you sometime.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** I left my oven on on the ship.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** I have to go back and turn it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** All right, so you're moving in, right?

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Nobody else is coming with you.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** The four of you are leading the way.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** I can't believe no goblins are coming with us, but all right.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** They were told by Bomb Guzzle not to because f*** Rolu.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** What about the Akeshdi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** No one, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** None.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** No, you can't.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** No, stop it.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Enough.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** I'm drawing a line.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** Wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:22]** I love the mental picture that they like overnight made banners and have like picket signs and some are like, good luck.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** The sacred wreckage.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Good luck.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** And some are like, f*** Roloo.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Hey, good to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** I would almost feel bad for Roloo if he wasn't a huge asshole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** Roloo gives a wink to Cordal.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** I'll see you soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Oh my god, the cringe.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** And he turns and heads in first.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** So Rolu's going in first based off of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** I'm going to move my token forward over.

**[00:27:51 - 00:28:01]** And I think as Rolu, there's a slight pause as Rolu's foot hits the ship walking inside.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** And he's going to stop five feet inside and look around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:12]** And I just love that Rolu is the first one in because Rolu is the only one that does not have low light or dark vision.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:21]** And so what you notice is outside of the stellar flare, it is the bright yellow sunlight, right?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** It's a hot desert.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** It's so bright.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** There's actually a sharp beam traveling through the open door.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:46]** and rolu you can see what's in that sharp beam but everything else immediately goes dark and you see like dust particles because there's no light everywhere else that's cool that's awesome dim light that's sweet so who's coming in next you guys all coming in or staying at the door they're all coming

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** All right, so you guys kind of come into this region.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:59]** You realize that this area is a cubicle airlock that measures about 20 feet on each side to allow for movement of large cargo.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** There are two sets of thick metal doors.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:22]** through the exterior one has been demolished and is hanging by just a hinge that's the one you guys just walk through and then the interior door is sealed shut there's a control panel on the north wall but the area around it has been scorched recently there's bits of metal and plastic scattered across the floor roll me an engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** 19.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Also 19.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Beautiful.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Okay.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Not trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:34]** So what you recognize is that box that's torn apart.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:40]** You discern that that was actually a result of Merc's EMP key.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:52]** So when she triggered that, it must have blew that panel and damaged this door and knocked it open, which explains the loud pop and all the smoke that you guys saw last night.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** Got it.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:02]** You actually, you would look back and you notice that the goblins are each kind of like taking their turn, peeking their heads in.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** Just like they're curious, but they're also like nervous, but excited.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Just like general curiosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:15]** Quick footnote, as Chuck enters the ship, he turns to Tork and knocks Shaven Haircut again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** And this time it echoes.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** And a ghost pops up and kills you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:27]** And Chuck pulls its pants down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** Trick or treat.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Now where's our candy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** As I said before, the other door is sealed shut.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** How do you want to try to get that door open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:50]** If no one can engineer it open, I can try to cut it open with my dash go, but some of you are tactical.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Can you get it open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** I'll try.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:58]** I can only see what's in this beam of light here, but I will...

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Try.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** I will rely on some of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Not total darkness.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** I might have misinterpreted that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:13]** It will be tough once I'm inside, so I may rely on the more astute vision and optics of some of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** I'm not trained in engineering, but I can try to assist you with some visual help.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:20]** Let's see if there's a panel around here.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:24]** Check looks for a button to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Rolu walks up to the front.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** It's a sensible first move, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:36]** You see the panel that was blown, and you notice that the control panel on it is actually shifted just a little bit.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** So go ahead, roll me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Chakra me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** Uh, either I'll let one of you assist if you want or 18 Treme assist.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Beautiful.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Um, so Chuck, you're already over there.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:54]** You kind of just pull that panel back and you see all the cables and wiring within, and you're actually, you notice that there's, there's a pressure switch.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:58]** and you're able to short across that switch, and it disengages the airlock seals.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Because it's an airlock, right?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** So one door opens, one door shuts.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Well, one door is clearly open.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** When that pressure is equalized, that's when it can actually open.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:18]** So as soon as you put that wire together, that door opens with a hiss, and you're hit with the blast of ozone-scented air that the force fields have kept inside for who knows how long.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** They got a model train running.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** Yeah.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** Let me just be an old gauge.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** All right.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** Real talk.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** That would be hella creepy.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** If there's a giant train set there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:43]** It's like a completely deserted ship, and it's just like... Yo, that is so terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** That's cool.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Okay, I see Chuck.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:53]** Okay, so the door opens up, and on the other side of the door, you see a wide archway that occupies one stretch of this hallway before an intersection.

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:01]** A podium stands on one side of that archway behind a glass partition, and there's a computer console and an overturned stool.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** Why don't you roll me a perception?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** 14.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** From Rollo.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** Rollo's eyes squint, trying to make everything out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** 17 from Jermaine.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** 26 from Chuck.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** And from Thaddeus, you have a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Chuck, I hate you.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** This looks like a security checkpoint.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** The archway is some kind of scanner.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:42]** From your side of this glass panel, Chuck being Chuck, is able to climb up just enough, and he notices that the computer screen still has power, but it's glitching, and it looks like there's a string of error messages on it.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** But what Chuck notices that nobody else does...

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:50]** Up ahead, in that intersection, on the roof, there's a circular cutout.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:54]** And you can barely see it, but there's something up there.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:00]** And there's a faint green glow coming from the inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** Chuck, what are you- It's a trap!

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Chuck, there's a trap?

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** What's up now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** I mean, not Rolu, don't look up.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Not you.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** Actually, you should go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** So this is not the first time that you've pulled a practical prank on me.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** You've pulled a funny.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** Yeah, you're such a comedian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** That was good.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** There's no reason that we have.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** No one's trying to get you hurt.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** Look up.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Why would we want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:35]** Look at the center of that intersection.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:40]** There's a faint circle in the middle, right?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** That circle's got a slight green glow.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:47]** That means there's probably something up there trying to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Like a green light.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Some kind of turret or something.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Could just be... Can I do an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** A luminescent frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** It just could be, you know, like a train set for Christmas tree.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** It could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Go ahead.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Roll me engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** 18 to get a sense of what it is.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** Roll is trying to think how would that circular cutout open?

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** What could realistically make that green light?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** We're still standing at the threshold of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:23]** So you're able to see actually some wires on that archway that connect to that computer.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:29]** And you're able to get your fingers through to it where that glass panel doesn't come quite all the way.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** And you're able to pull on them just enough.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** And the computer screen seems to stop flickering.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** And the error messages go away.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:43]** And now Chalk tells you, because he's the only one that can really see it because he can get up close enough to it.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:50]** It shows an image of an auto turret and an image of the archway.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:56]** The turret is green and the archway is red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:02]** Can I try to disable that archway like the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Okay.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** There is a glass panel there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** Got it.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:12]** I'm going to try to hit the glass panel with my pincer and shatter it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Oh man, I didn't think about hardness.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:23]** What I was going to say is that I think Chuck would be the only one able to do the computer's check because he's probably the only one that can fit up and over that glass panel without walking through the archway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Cause he's tiny.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** What's up?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Oh, he's tiny.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** What's up?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** That's a tiny boy.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** That's a tiny boy.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:36]** If y'all want to yeet me over the glass to touch the panel, I'm good with that.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Hey, come on.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** I'll lift you up.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** You want to yeet me over this panel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** We've got this junk drone, baby.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** I got you, baby.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I got you.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** And kind of like takes one hand and like pushes him over gently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** All right, go ahead and roll me computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:52 - 00:37:00]** So anyway, it started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:06]** Yeah, no, it just doesn't do anything.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:10]** The turret is still green and the scanner is still red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:15]** Can I try to see if there's obvious wiring between the arch and the turret?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** I guess that would be another engineering check?

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Maybe perception?

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Give me one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Perception.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** He says confidently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Yeah, that's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Yeah, you don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Check what's going on.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:36]** I've got bad news and just bad news.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** This computer's not doing anything.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** And also, I can't figure out how these wires are connected.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** Can I just like smash the computer?

**[00:37:49 - 00:38:17]** uh do you want to do that uh yeah i mean i tried to hack it so now i'm just gonna know about this i'm gonna like pull out the fastball blaster and just shoot it check i i would please don't shoot that computer it may be useful can i try and stop you or do you just do it i mean you could try you could you could use your words but i think uh let's let the let's let the die decide all right let's let the data sign


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** To be fair... Do you want me to roll a diplomacy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:28]** I'll just state that I did find the material hardness stuff just for reference.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** Okay.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:34]** Chuck rolled a one on wisdom, so he's going to shoot the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** All right.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Here we go.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Thank you, Chuck.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:56]** So you shoot the computer, and as you do, a klaxon blares, a red light flashes, the laser turret descends from the ceiling, and you need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Wow.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Hero!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** This is totally Leroy Jenkins here.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** This is 10 for Thaddeus.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** And yes, Leroy Jenkins.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** That's a 20 on the die for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Nice.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** It's a 21 for Rolo.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** 13 for Tamei.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** 13 for Tamei.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Thaddeus?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** 10.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** 10 for Thaddeus.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** All right, that works.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Rolo, you are up.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** You move first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** I think Chuck goes first.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Chuck got a 22.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** 20 or 22?

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** 22.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** I got 22.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Chuck, you go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:37]** I want to look around quickly to see if there's any other obvious controls for this auto turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** You can roll perception on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Sure.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** That's a nine.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** It's a nine?

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Yeah, you don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:53]** Are we able to help perceive this, or is it just because Shaq was the only one trained initially in engineering that only he can?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Training computers.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:59]** I expect you'd be able to perceive something, but you'd probably have to be closer.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Yep.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Yeah.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** No controls or anything.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Okay.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Cool.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** I'm going to try to shoot the darn thing.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Since shooting the computer didn't work, I'm going to shoot the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Shoot things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** That's what I always do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** That's a 16 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** This is a force weapon.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** Deals kinetic damage, but still targets EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Perfect.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Then it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Dope.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** 1d8 plus 1.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** So check.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Turns bright red.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Yeah.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:52]** embarrassed because he triggered the very trap he was trying to deactivate turns to this turret aims right down the iron sights and hits it just down the barrel nice for max damage that's nine b what's b b bludgeoning bludgeoning nine bludgeoning damage interesting so you do that and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:03]** and your laser hits, but it just kind of absorbs into the steel of this turn.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** So no damage?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** It's Rolo's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** It's like a force field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:28]** Rolu takes a five foot step forward in front of the glass or next to the checkpoint and just for a second is overcome with a sense of indecision about what to do and then just decides to start looking for another way to shut off this trap.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** And I was going to make an engineering check to see if there's another way that I can shut it off.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** Is that allowable by you, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:58]** i'll give you another engineering check okay uh 16 on engineering uh yeah no you can there's the archway you see the computer all right yeah was that my you you you know that the computer the archway are we're connected and that's what was controlling this thing but the computer's broken now yeah okay am i was that a standard action

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** But I'll give that to you for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Okay, cool.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:08]** Then Rolu is going to... Is going to take another 10 feet forward.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** Is going to... Actually, he's going to walk...

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:16]** I think... No, there's no place to go here.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:24]** Just for the listener, this is a tiny 10-foot corridor, and the security checkpoint is so well-placed right behind the door, so it just takes up everything.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:41]** So Rulu's going to run up in front of Chak, give Chak a strong side-eye, and having pulled out his long arm, his azimuth serpent laser, and takes a shot...

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Rolling a 22.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** That's a hit.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Okay.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Sweet.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** Okay, that is going to be with my new weapon specialization.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** As they say, eight points of fire damage.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** against this turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** It gets absorbed into the metal.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Goodness.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** All right.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Cool.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** That's my turn.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Traps in Starfinder suck.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** They'll mess you up.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** I mean, like, really bad.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** I'm scared for you guys, because it is now the turret's turn.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** It's going to first... It wears up.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:25]** As it comes down, that green line turns red, and it's going to hit every single person in range on one round.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Wow.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** For real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** What's the range?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** How will it get through this corridor, this narrow thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Yeah.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:38]** So, the panel, the glass panel, lasers can move or shoot through glass.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** I should still have some partial coverage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** But isn't there, like, isn't this, like, little check-in area?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** Isn't that, like, kind of blocking some of that?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Those doors are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** No, that's what I'm telling you.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:51]** Yeah, those doors are wide open.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** The security checkpoint.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** The podium there is only about waist high.

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:03]** And so if you're right next to the podium and prone, I would give you cover or a partial cover, but you're further back.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** And this thing is up on the roof.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** So no, I'm going to say no.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** And I marked this all out so we wouldn't have this argument.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:17]** But Thaddeus, Torme, you are in sight and have no cover.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Same thing with Chak and Rolu.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Except Chak, I'm going to give you a plus two because you're behind Rolu.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** But before all that happens, this gun picks the farthest target first.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** And there is a goblin peeking its head out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Yeah, there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:57]** kev you monster dude i'm telling you man the murder god the murdering is like i mean this is what i would do too but still you're a monster does the turret jump down and like kick the turret the the the goblin in the pants yeah it actually just looting shreds the goblin his head's picking out and just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:13]** and just like puffs of just goblin blood which is i'm assuming green so this goblin now is dead how much damage does this thing do is this can we do like is this a named goblin or is this like generic goblin number four

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Yeah.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** That was actually the goblin's name.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Did this goblin have a red shirt on?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** It was generic goblin number eight.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Oh.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:28]** And as that happens, you almost hear the other goblins and Akeshi scream, and they back away from the door.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** I'm really glad you didn't force me to put Vahri in there.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Now it's time to see who we hit.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Oh, shit.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** Goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Why would you do this, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Treme.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:43]** Treme, do you... Does a 20... No, sorry.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** 31 hit?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** You know it does.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Again, Kev.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** I don't know what game you think we're playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** What kind of game do you think... Yes, a 31 hits.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** 31.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** Oh, my God, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** That is 14 points of damage.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Holy cow!

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** I'm telling you, traps fucking suck in this game.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Dude, they're great.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** But they suck.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** This is awesome.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** So it's 14 points of damage for you.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** Uh, I'm pretty sure, uh, 27 hits, um, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** For KC or whatever, or EAC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** Uh, I think it's, uh... Does it matter?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Yeah.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** I mean, it does, but I am curious.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** It's EAC, right?

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Because it's a laser?

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** I'm pretty sure it's EAC, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:21]** All right.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** And what was this, what was it again?

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** 26, yeah.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** Okay, that's... Dude.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** 15 points of damage.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:34]** Okay, next, uh, we have Chalk, Chalk...

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:42]** 20 points against your AC, but you get a plus 2 for soft target.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** I'm sure.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Wow.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:52]** 10 points of damage.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Yikes.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Okay.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** And finally roll it.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** That is a natural one.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:09]** So it goes... So it destroys itself and dies and we can move on, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Critical fumble deck?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Yeah, I'll give it a critical fumble.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** What?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:13]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** I like critical fumbles.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Awesome.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** I think they're fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Let's do it.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Let's-a do it.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** Here we go.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Ready?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Let's-a do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Let's-a do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Here we go.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Cool.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** Three, two, flick of the cards, one go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Stop.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Okay.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** Is this a... Is this an energy attack or a kinetic attack?

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Energy.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Energy.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** You can't... Wow, this is wasted.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** You can't take a guarded step for 10 minutes.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** Okay.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Word to the wise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Target misses, Robbie.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Awesome.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:46]** So it goes... And it kind of, like, gets... I don't know.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** It shoots, like, around you somehow.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:54]** Your precog ability, like, lets you juke and jive or something.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** Juke and jive.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Shotgun dive.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** That is the end of the auto turrets.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Turn, Termay, you are up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:10]** So, uh, Termay's gonna... I mean, like, what is the... Can I... What can I, skill-wise, do to check and see is this, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:38]** magical item or is it a life science engineering physical thing that we can examine to understand what this armor this trap is it is it is an auto turret do you want to do you can do um i guess it'd be an engineering check on it to get information because you can do life science so you would do engineering i believe right yeah physical science or and i'll give you physical science sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** So this would be like recall knowledge, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Man, I don't have the skills up front of me.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** I can't remember all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** Maybe.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** Maybe you've seen this once before.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Yeah, we just kind of make it up as we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yeah.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:54]** Or should we do identify technology is probably more the speed.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Right?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Okay, so engineering.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Natural 20, so 21.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** Yes.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** And that goes against, I forget.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Yeah, no, I'll give that to you.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** I'll give you a few pieces of information.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:11]** So the reason none of your shots are going through is because it has a hardness of 10.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Oh my.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:16]** So that means that nothing less than 10 will do any damage to this.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** You subtract 10 from every shot.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:28]** And something else for you is that it will continue to shoot for six rounds, and then it retracts up and has to recharge for one minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:31]** Is there a way we can, like, well, it's not my turn, short it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:40]** Hey, guys, we can maybe fool this thing and sneak past it after 60 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Or, no, 36 seconds, right?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** You said six rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Yeah, I can't do math.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Yeah, 36 seconds.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:48 - 00:50:11]** yeah 30 more seconds so i uh i tell you guys this and i'm saying hey we should just run out for 60 36 seconds and see what happens and then come back in yeah so tactical retreat sounds like a good idea of course thaddeus says that of course the one time it makes sense okay so termites you're still your turn do you want to make a move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Yeah, I'm going to move outside.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Let's get the fuck out of here, man.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:21]** So Torme backtracks and stands right outside the closed door of the two doors.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** There's one that's the hinge blown off.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Torme ducks behind the one that's closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** Thaddeus runs out as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:52]** goes around the corner out of sight of shot and termay is counting like in his head he's tracking like the the time from the last movement so it'll be the last time somebody he's waiting for the last person to cross the threshold from outside to then start counting and then that would be 36 seconds right and then we could go back in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** I think you're overthinking it.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** It's six rounds of combat, and the six rounds have already started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:05]** Thaddeus is going to inject a serum into him to heal up in the meantime, which I think I can do as a standard action or whatever.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** To me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** Yeah, to myself.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Oh, to yourself.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** All right, so Thaddeus also retreats, gets behind a wall.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** That's the end of round one.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** So we're into round two.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Chuck, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** Chuck is going to try his darndest to climb back over this glass.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** Like he is in full panic mode.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** I'm going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:32]** So if you're going to scurry over the glass, I'm going to say that that's going to take almost a move action just to do that.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** So that would be one full move action to move the five feet across that glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Cool.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:46]** I'm going to use my other move action to get around this corner so that I am not in line of sight for this turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** Alright, so Chuck scurries up and over this glass in a panic and then ducks behind a wall there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:57]** I imagine the 90 degree right turn was sort of like a dog running on tile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:01]** Sliding out a little.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** Rolloo, what are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:15]** I was thinking about how I can use a really cool thing that I bought that I have not had a chance to use yet, but I don't think this is the right time to do it.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:22]** Can I do one more engineering check before I run out?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** To see if there's a way to disable it.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:31]** Or you can just say, you know, like, it's very clear to me that we just got to fight it.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Because Rolo's racking his brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** I'm just going to give it to you.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Because it kind of doesn't matter what you roll.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** Your engineering check would have disabled the scanner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Scanner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Right?

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Just follow me on this.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:43]** Yeah.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Yeah, it would have disabled the scanner.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:53]** A computer's check would have stalled it for one round, but chalk destroyed the computer.

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:01]** So actually, no, give me give me your engineering check and I will see if you're able to disable the scanner.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:05]** But the problem is, even if you do disable it, it is still going to continue for six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** What was the scanner's relationship to the thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Do you want me to just read the entire book to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** I don't know any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:22]** I know less than what I... What would I know from the wreckage of this scanner and this security and this technology?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** I know less than what I know before because I rolled a 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** So you're not able to disable the scanner, but now you do.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** I did tell you, like, this will continue to shoot for six rounds.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Yes.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Even if the scanner is disabled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** Okay.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** All right.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:43]** Roll is going to run outside very quickly and stand outside next to May and make sure that everyone else is backed away from the entrance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Okay.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** So you guys all step out and this thing is, it goes right.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:55]** It actually, as you're running out, it goes and like follows you in a trail because it was just about its turn.

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:01]** And then it, you just hear it scanning round number three.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** Anybody want to do anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** I want to not get shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** Yeah, that sounds kind of nice.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** So you're all standing still?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Yeah.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:15]** So, I mean, we want it to burn its charge, right?

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Like, you said it was going to fire no matter what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:24]** Chuck grabs, like, a screen and throws it into the sight line of the...

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Yeah, is there, like, junk I can toss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:30]** Yeah, so Chuck reaches down and grabs, like, a rock or whatever debris he can find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** Throws it into the site.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Throws it up in the air.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:37]** Tremé is throwing some scrap metal with his psychokinetic hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:42]** And as you guys are testing it out, it goes, it just shreds whatever you guys throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** God, dude.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Chuck kind of makes a game of it.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** It's like, how many of these can I throw at a time?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** And it's still, like, bullseyes everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** So you guys are just going to play this out.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** You're just going to wait out, mess with it.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** Yeah.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** You're waiting out all six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:05]** After six rounds and Chuck, Chuck throws one more piece up and it goes, and the, the, um, the light turns yellow.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Click.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Nice.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:14]** And you hear it go up under the roof and he throws that piece up and it hits the ground and Chuck, Chuck shots like we're all clear.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:39]** we're all clear i sort of imagine the wise vacuum low battery returning to home and i'll start the timer click cool okay so we have 10 10 let's move 10 right uh the first thing chak wants to do is try to disable this scanner are we still in initiative order we're just going i think we are but i'm at the top of the round how's this work are we still in initiative order


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** No, we'll take it in ammunition order, but I have a timer set.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Cool.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Okay, where did you go?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** I can't see you.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** I'm right in front of the scanner.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** Okay, so you get around that scanner and you actually see a piece.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:53]** The computer that you shot, the screen is still partially working.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Yeah.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:58]** And you see a timer over where the turret was and the hole is now because you shot it.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** And that timer says 58, 57, 56.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Awesome.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:08]** but you also see the edge of where the scanner is, and that scanner is red.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** So go ahead, roll me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** I'm on engineering.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** 11.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I got nothing.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Got nothing.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:19]** Guys, we've got very limited time, but I can't figure this out.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** We might want to get moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Let's go.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Yes.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** So we're going to run in.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** What's the deal?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** We're rushing past it?

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Yes.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** And it won't detect us when we run under it for a little while, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** That's the idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I think it needs to charge.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** All right.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** He tops off with another serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** He's just back there in the corner shooting up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:43]** Tremaine's going to hit himself with a healing serum for sure.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** Choc's got a whole band around his arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Yeah.

**[00:56:49 - 00:57:17]** i also have healing serums i can hear everyone up but we need to make a decision about where to go so we can i'm fine so we can heal up can we just disable this while it's charging or no i don't believe that there's a way that we can disable it it's not weak while it's charging we can't like shoot it you know oh no because it's just hard as nails right yes then we should just get past it as quickly as possible out of its range of scan all right i guess this is about eight squares into the right is that a door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:34]** uh no i'll get to that in a second um so you guys are all past the scanner give me a roll whatever you can at me each of you all four for what uh like i can roll an acrobatics roll at you is that what you're saying well that's silly

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** No, something that... I don't know, man.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** Physical science, computers, anything.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Perception.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Perception.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** 19.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Beautiful.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** 23.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Engineering.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** 17.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Mysticism.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** 24%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** Hey, you guys finally get it all to come together.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** You guys all get past it.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:59]** You're underneath it looking up and you're like, okay, this is what I know about the computers.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** You're like, okay, this is what I know about the engineering.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:09]** And then Treme is like, I think that it kind of might have something to do with... And while he's doing that, Thaddeus is doing backflips.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** And everybody's like, what the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:15]** By the way, there's a lot of dead Gheshti in here.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** So Chuck...

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:40]** chalk holds up the two pieces of the broken screen together while rolu is looking at the cables more closely on from the other side and he pulls the green one and the outline goes or the red picture of the scanner turns to a clear outline and you just see vated because the screen is broken

**[00:58:40 - 00:59:04]** and when you look up termay is the one that's actually looking up at the device in the ceiling like almost waiting for it to move and that yellow light turns off completely great great teamwork guys i think it's off so i need to just hold this green wire the entire time and then it will stay off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** No, you pulled it.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** That's right.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:09]** Roller, you hold that wire while we explore the rest of the... All right.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** The rest of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** Do you guys mind if I invite Cordal in here?

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** Okay.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** All right.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** So now you guys are standing in the middle of this intersection.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:24]** The corridors are mostly featureless, like you were asking about, with occasional bits of debris.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** The hall to your left runs about 60 feet and turns right.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** There's a door along that hallway to the north side of that hallway.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Okay.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** The corridor to the right also runs about 60 feet and turns left.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** There are two doors along that side of the corridor.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:43]** But the first door looks crumpled and so does the wall kind of around it.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** It looks really damaged.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:50]** Straight ahead of you to the north of the map, it runs about 40 feet and there's a perpendicular wall there.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** And then the corridor splits off to the left and the right.

**[00:59:52 - 01:00:03]** But you can tell that the wall ends right there, and that path to the right might open up to either a bigger room or possibly a hallway moving forward.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** 16.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** 14.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** 22.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Natural 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]** Termay's still watching that turret because he doesn't trust it.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Turret man.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:24]** The rest of you hear metal clinking against metal echoing down the hallways.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:46]** clink clink clink clink whoa chalk though his ears are a little bit sharper and he recognizes that that sound is coming from the corridor to the left but it is also kind of coming from the corridor straight ahead is it so does it mean at some point does it sound heavy is it like a tinkling what what what what what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Oh, wow.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** I was not expecting that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:53]** Kev's cliffhangers are getting real good.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** I don't know that I like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** Yeah, I know.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:07]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
