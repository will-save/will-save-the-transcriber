## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** My name is Kevin Decker.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:02]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:07]** And yes, I read that off every time because I still can't remember it.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** What?

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:11]** I think I can say it now because you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:16]** I can never remember if it's like from or of or like those, you know, I get the, what are those called?

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:17]** Prepositions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Yes, prepositions almost.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** There it is.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** You can say either.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** It's not bad at English.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Isn't it?


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** Because I'm not great at English.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** I think of sounds fancier.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** Is it a preposition or is it an article?

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** I always mix those up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:33]** No, the article is a and the, right?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** So I think preposition.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Is it ablative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:41]** I'm supposed to end a sentence in a preposition, right?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** And I do that all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** From.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Isn't it from?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Don't we use from?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** From of to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** Is that what you're thinking on, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** You could say thinking on or of.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Very good.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** Is that what you're thinking of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** You read it from a script, so... I read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** I read it off every time.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** I read everything.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Slowly.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** Man, so how are you guys doing?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** How's life?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** What's new?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** Anything going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:20]** Just... Just... Just thinking about combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Yeah, just...

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:27]** Weirdly have this combat that plays through my mind sometimes, which is a large... No, it's good.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** We've got to prepare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Vinny's dying of a cough.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** I have to prepare myself mentally for it, sure.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** Have you done that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** I prepared for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** I think Vinny's going to be fine.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** We pulled him out.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** I'm a little worried about Vinny.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** As much as I love Starfighter, we got some more important things to talk about.

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:00]** As promised, last week, Vinny said he was going to give us all his reasons that Digimon is better than Pokemon.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:06]** And I have to be honest that I'm excited to hear this because I watched way more Digimon than I did Pokemon.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Okay.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** I'll state that.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** I don't know if I liked it better.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Digital monsters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** Digimon are the champions.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** So one, it's a better theme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** Whoa, whoa, I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:19]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:24]** The American version of Pokemon, or the English Pokemon theme is amazing.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** We have used it in this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** I want to be the very best.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** No one was before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Okay, okay.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** I think it's a better song.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** That wasn't correct.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I don't think it's a better theme.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** I don't even know what the Digimon theme is.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** I would never listen to the Digimon theme.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** Like, ever.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** That is not in a playlist anywhere.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:49]** I would listen to the Pokemon theme song on Spotify.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:56]** But I'm of the opinion that a theme should really be reflective of whatever content that it's introducing.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** And I think the Digimon theme is a much more indicative theme.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** I hope it's trash.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Strong opinion there.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** I think Pokemon is not very deep, so that the theme sort of makes sense to me.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** That's literally all it is.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** We're going to catch all these Pokemon.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Well, Digimon's way deeper.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** We got to give it that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** How deep do you have to be for Pokemon?

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** It is literally, I'm going to catch them all.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** And I'm going to catch everything.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** And there were only 150 to begin with, so it wasn't that hard.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** That's my next beef.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Here we go.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:34]** I want to qualify this by saying we are talking about the show exclusively.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** We are not talking about the game.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** We're not talking about anything outside of TV shows.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** If that was the case, Pokemon would win head and shoulders.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** But Pokemon is bubblegum pop.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** There's zero substance.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** It's the monkeys.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** And Digimon's the beetles?

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Sorry, go ahead.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** Basically, yeah.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Oh, God.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** Digimon gets into real-world interpersonal dynamics.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** You're dealing with death.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** You're dealing with interesting family dynamics.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** Evolution.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:17]** Pokemon is all about, yeah, sure, my eight-year-old can go roam the world with this monster he just found in the grass.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** What's your one goal, dude?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Oh, you're going to catch all of them?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Godspeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** By the way, there's 3,000 more now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** I don't remember Digimon.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** What was the premise of Digimon?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** They fell into their computers and then were fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** They're considered the Digi-destined.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:43]** It is their fate to save the world from these very real villains.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** Not two clowns and a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:57]** Also, isn't it like people accidentally entering the digital world and encountering Digimon or something like that?

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** I think that was season three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** And then the digital world bleeds into the real world at one point.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** And they actually exist in the real world.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Go ahead, John.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** You've had your hand up for a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:17]** Well, I want to ask Will, Kelly, and Benny, since you all do a lot of software and programming, how often do you encounter the same problems that they encounter in Digimon in your day-to-day work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** When you're going to work, do you follow your computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:25]** I actually have no idea what problems they face, but I constantly face those problems, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** That's what takes so long to edit an episode.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** I keep falling into... Wait, wait, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Kev, you said you never hit start.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Does that mean that you're not recording?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** No, I'm recording.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:42]** That's why I put it in the chat, John, so we wouldn't have this conversation on air.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:47]** Anyway, yeah, dude, hey, I was... I forgot to hit start, so I have no idea how long we've been bantering.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** We've been bantering for five minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:53]** That's fine, just next time say, I never hit start on the timer.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** I never hit start on my big red button of recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** If that's the case, I would have been like, hey guys, I'm not recording.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** I got a timer on my watch.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** Can I just say one thing about this Digimon Pokemon thing?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:07]** Please.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** I've never been a fan of Pokemon or Digimon.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:23]** Now having researched all of 30 seconds on Digimon and Pokemon, I believe that I am on team Digimon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:29]** Will's a time traveler, but it doesn't mean he's been in every single period of time.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** He was gone in the 90s.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** He was like somewhere else.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** I was busy doing other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** I watched both of them equally.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:43]** But I feel like Digimon, they had a broader scope is what it is.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** We talked about Pokemon.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:51]** The original was just 150 Pokemon and you went from gym to gym and that was it.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** It was simple and straightforward.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** But yeah,

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** I think you're right.

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:00]** Digimon was like, we're saving the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** It got real serious, man.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** There were real family issues too, like you were saying.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** And then, yeah, it was interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** You have some fair arguments.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** I can't say it's better.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** I think Pokemon is definitely better established.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Very different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** The world building of Pokemon is amazing.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** You gotta give it that.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** These four attributes are head and shoulders better, but I can't say that it's better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:31]** I think they're probably about equal.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I think they're equivalent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:43]** There is a reason why super groups sometimes suck even though all the members in it are really ideally talented and famous and awesome musicians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:50]** If that's the picture, then Pokemon is NSYNC and Digimon is Justin Timberlake.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** That is perfect because they're both great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** So what are we?

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Are we in sync?

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** Justin Timberlake has head and shoulders better than NSYNC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:04]** If we're on our own individually, would we totally suck?

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:07]** And then only if the five of us are together, we're actually good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I think I'm pretty awesome.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:13]** Based on the odds, one of us is going to be a superstar.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** The rest of us are going to fade from the zeitgeist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** No.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** I will travel back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** We'll do the reunion tour in 20 years and it'll be great.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** I'll end up being Lance or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** We'll just be years later like, oh, he did a life transformation.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** One of you will host Love is Blind season 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:38]** One of us will host the Space Academy or something.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Didn't Lance do that?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** Lance Bass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** To wrap this up,

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Let me just bring it back to the top.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** I really just want to do the biopic for Huelhauser.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:55]** Let me just read the lyrics to the Pokemon and the Digimon theme songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** Okay, I do have to admit, I got it wrong.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** He's like reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** Turning into an amoeba.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** He's like, I don't want to.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I want to be the very, very best.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** No one ever was.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** To catch them is my real test.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** To train them is my cause.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:14]** I will travel across the land searching far and wide.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** Teach Pokemon to understand the power that's inside.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Meanwhile, let me read the Digimon.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:30]** They are... Digimon, Digimon, Digimon.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Digimon, Digimon, Digimon.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Jump ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the champions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the champions.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Vinny, did you... That goes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** Did you pull your argument out of the ether?

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:49]** I totally forgot that those were lyrics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Now the bridge.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Digivolve into champion.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** Digivolve into ultimate.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** That's it.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Yeah, so the Digivolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** The Digivolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:15]** While some Digimon act like wild beasts, many formal small societies and follow governing bodies such as the Royal Knights or the Digimon Sovereign, Digimon can grow through evolution.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Digivolution.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:25]** By absorbing additional data and changing forms, the process is normally linear, but there are other methods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** What does this mean?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** I'm fascinated.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** One of the fundamental ways that Digimon and Pokemon... John, you're right.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** The Digimon theme sucks.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** I'm going to flip my position on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** You know what it is?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Digimon hits harder.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** It's got a better beat.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** It's catchy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** It's not as catchy as the Pokemon theme.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** No way.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** No way.

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:00]** Oh, so like the way Pokemon evolve, you've got your stage one, stage two, stage three.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:08]** We're not going to get into all of the mega... Are we getting into the science of Pokemon evolution?

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** No, just a quick overview.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:14]** With Digimon, and like they change from one entity to a completely different entity.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:18]** So when you think of like Charmander to Charmeleon to Charizard, like...

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:25]** The biggest attitude in the Pokemon universe is a Charizard, which is not true of a Charmeleon or Charmander.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:36]** With Digimon, they evolve as the need grows, and then they go back to their cute and cuddly whoever they were before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Which I think is a big appeal as characters get.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** They're adaptive to their environment.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Yes.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:42]** Go ahead, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** Which universe would you rather live in, though?

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:49]** I mean, if you had to spend time with Pokemon, hunting a bunch of different Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** As an NPC, because that's all we ever are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:56]** Well, one of us statistically is a PC, because one of us is JT, right?

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** So the others are NPCs.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:05]** Well, I feel like Pokemon, all they do is just shout their own names repeatedly, especially Scyther, who's really annoying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Scyther!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** Scyther!

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** They can talk like humans.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:15]** Yeah, but the Digimon, you'll have an existential conversation with them, and it's really different.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:19]** When I was a kid and I saw that, I was like, why the f*** is the monster talking this much?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Shut the f*** up.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** I'm just battling s***.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** But now I guess I would prefer the Digimon.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Okay, Michael Bick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** I don't get that reference.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** Next time, Power Rangers versus Beetleborgs.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Yeah, I was going to say that.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:38]** So I definitely had – I was thinking about it.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** I had all of them.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** I had Tamagotchi.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:48]** I had the Pikachu counter one, and I think I even had a Digimon evolution pocket thing.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** Anyways, my age is not relevant to this, and it's time to play Starfinder.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Yeah, we're going to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** It's time to play Starfinder.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:59]** Dude, if there's a Pokemon tabletop or Digimon tabletop, we've got to play it someday.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** There's got to be one.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** I'm sure.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Dude, there has to be one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Tag us.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Tell us what it is.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Maybe we'll play it.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Cool, but let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** But only if we're trying to be our very best.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Like no one ever was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** Huel, are you cuing us into a play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** I already said let's play.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** Cut the shit and get serious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** That was me doing it.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** That was you.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** Here we go.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** That's me.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Here we go.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** My summary.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Last time.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Wrong last time.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** Last time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** Yes, last time on We'll Save.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** Is that how you did it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** Yeah, like the Dragon Ball Z opening.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** Last time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** We left the Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** That's right.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** You all are boarding a ship to Absalon Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Oh, no, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** I don't want to do that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Nope.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** So in reality, well, not.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:11]** Last time, we got right back into the fight with Asashla and Bumguzzle.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** But you aren't in the clear.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** Asashla is going after whoever is closest to her.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** Rolu is the first to learn this as he tries to step back and let the other two just get at each other.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:31]** As the unbrood and the trash hunters wage war in the background, you all join in on the fight right in front of you.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** Except Thaddeus, who runs away as usual.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** Hashtag tactics or something like that.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** It's a caricature of Thaddeus.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Right?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** It's not accurate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:48]** Torme, on the other hand, cast Adamantine Spell and got a critical hit on Asashla that knocked her prone.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:56]** Chak then got real brave but missed a couple of melee attacks only to be nearly killed by Asashla's next attack.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:07]** Meanwhile, Bomb Gozzle focused his attacks on Asashla, but it was also very clear that Chak is still on his list because he killed Tinkerton, you know, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Did he kill Tinkerton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:15]** Well, Asashla made an attempt on both Rolu and Torme, but missed.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:23]** However, a goblin then jumped on her back, and she grabbed that goblin just by the head and crushed him.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** Just flipped him forward and smacked him dead in the ground.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** That's where we ended the game.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** Let's get back to the map and back into combat.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** You sound really excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** I mean, I'm not.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** I don't like this battle.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:41]** I don't like that we're so close to getting fucked up.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** I do like this battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** It's just tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Let's get into the ship.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** I want to discover what's inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** I know.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** No.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Fun fact.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** You don't ever enter the ship in this.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Kevin.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Are you serious?

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** I didn't write it.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** It's Jason's fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** The biggest red herring I've ever seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:05]** Dude, if that's if you're not messing with us, then, oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Could not be more of a red herring if it was a literal fish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** I thought a herring was a bird.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** So, where were we?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Um...

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** Just for the listener review, we have the Stellar Flare.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** We're all at the entrance there.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:29]** There's a tent off to the left side, where is the camp that Merc and Kesh were hanging out at, and Vahri ended up staying as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** We slept in it once, too, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** In, around, yeah, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Don't forget the Hears poster.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** The Hears poster was revealed at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** That's right.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Let's get that after the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Yeah, we'll get to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:50]** But if you were to draw just a big red line down the middle of this map all the way to the bottom, you can kind of put the Akestis on the right and the goblins on the left, and they kind of spread out all the way to the back.

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:04]** And then right in the middle, right in front of the door to the Stellar Flare, we have a large creature, you know, 10 foot by 10 foot by 10, 12, 16 feet tall, Akesti Rivener, named Sashla.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** And then we have Bomb Gozzle about 10 feet away, 15 feet away to the left, and

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:15]** And then we have the rest of our PCs, our players, kind of in between them and the door.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** And it's actually Bomb Gozzle's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** Oh.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Yeah.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Right.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** What do they do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** Well, Bomb Gozzle had been attacking Asashla, but he sees that she's getting weaker.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** And he looks around and he makes out this giant disruptive screech.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Like what?

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:47]** I'm actually yelling at my computer now because I scrolled too fast.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** That was a good screech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:58]** And because of that screech, I put on the map, but it's 30 foot distance.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** So anybody within 30 feet of him, that is not a goblin.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:02]** So Mark is safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** Wait.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** What?

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** 30 feet?

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Wow.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** 30 feet?

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** What is this?

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** A scream?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** A battle cry?


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Do you guys want me to tell you?

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Keep going.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Yeah, I want to know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** It's called Screech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** And it, like, hurts us in the ears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** Well, I'm going to need everybody within that 30 feet, which is all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Just everyone, pretty much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Yeah.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** To give me a DC will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Will save!

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** Will save!

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** Oh, it looks like a Sashla passes that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** It's a 23.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Please tell me that passes, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Roller got a 12.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** 17?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** All right, so Rolu is the only one affected out of everybody on the battlefield.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Freaking me.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:02]** And you are now off target, which is a minus two to your tax for one D4 rounds.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Let me roll that D4 for you.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:04]** It's a one.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** You get one round.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** One round of being off target.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Thank you for making that seem so pointless.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** No, that's good, dude.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:17]** No, we're so... We're disappointed that didn't happen, man.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** Dude, it's a minus two penalty to attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Yeah, I really wanted my ears to bleed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:28]** To just you, but your attacks don't count, so... What the f... That's rude.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** And with that, so Bomb Guzzle's then going to step back towards the Goblin some.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** I'm running away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** Tactically retreating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** Everyone needs to understand that this is how battles work, all right?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** I'm not even kidding at this point.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** This is a real thing.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Don't disrespect it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:53]** You stand and bang, and that's the only tactic that you need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** So speaking of run away, Thaddeus, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** Yeah, so Thaddeus is going to run away up this way.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** Because it's fucking the screech, man.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** No, no way.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** 30 feet?

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Uh-uh, I'm not dealing with that.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** The 5, 10, 15, 20.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:15]** All right, Thaddeus is still within range of shooting this guy, but he's going to go out of range of his screech.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:19]** All right, which is just up to the northeast corner.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:42]** a little bit behind the door to the show just for the listener he's near the depressed farther away yes that's correct i'm not ashamed to say it and he's next to that depressed australian akesh d guy that's who they're all australian thanks to john well this this particular pink depressed one that's one oh the depressed one the one who's like like really sad all the time murk

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** So what are you doing?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:52]** You're moving in the... So now he's going to take the... I'm just going to look at the rubbish cannon again and see if this is any bit useful, which I picked up last time.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:59]** It kind of is actually kind of dope, but it's a bit too far, so I can't really use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:12]** So just a reminder, it was brought up again in our Rules and Mistakes channel on Discord, is that if you're out of range for your weapon, you can then take, I believe it's a minus five for every additional five feet.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Double check those numbers.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** You basically take a range penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:23]** I'm going to try to do the hand off the chest piece thing because I'll try to stick to that.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Otherwise, I would have gone back and fired and then moved.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** I would have done it in reverse, but whatever.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** So I'll do that.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** I'll take that.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Nah, f*** it.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** It's not worth it.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:36]** So I'm just going to go and hit him with the Venom Caster because I hate him.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** It's a 14 to hit.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Does that hit?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** It's KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Who are you attacking?

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Bomb Guzzle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** Yeah.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** No, no.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** The big ass, like a Keshti, a Sashla or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Sashla.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Sashla.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** It's a KAC?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** Correct.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** And a 14?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** That's a miss.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:02]** And it might not even be in a mist, but it effectively does nothing because it just pinks off her skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Oh, because we can't.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** It has to be magical damage.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** Is that right?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** It can't be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:08]** No, you're getting those mixed up with the other creatures.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Maybe.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Maybe not.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** I can't confirm that.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** What?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Wait, okay.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:21]** So now he's going to check and do some kind of, I guess, life science check to see if, like, you know, kinetic damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** I thought we did a life science.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** We might have.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** She is basically just a battle mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** Kevin damage works, right?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Like, I mean, I can attack her with darts.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:31]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** Yeah, you can try to attack her with darts, but you missed.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** So that's your whole turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Yeah, that is.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:41]** And he just kind of like shouts like in the distance, like, because he's like really far now.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** He's like kind of upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** He shouts his disappointment at everybody on the field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** They're just like, oh, what the hell is he doing all the way over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** Well, that's the end of round number three, I think.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** I'm keeping track.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Let's move into round number four.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** It is now Rolu's turn.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Rolu, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Okay, a couple things.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** One, range penalties, very quickly.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:07]** Cumulative minus two penalty to the attack roll for each full range increment between you and the target.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** So it's good to know.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Two, check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Wait, wait, so explain that again.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:17]** So if your range is 30 feet and somebody is at 65 feet, it's going to be minus two and then minus two again and again.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Again and again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** No, no, no.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:22]** If you're in just 30 feet, then if you go beyond 30 feet, it's minus two.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** If you go beyond 60 feet, it's minus four.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** That's what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Again, again, again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Yeah.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Cool.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** All right.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** Jack, what are you at hit points wise again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Tell me, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** I want to know.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** I am at one hit point.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:41]** I'm at two stamina points.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Two stamina points.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** One hit point.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** Let me pull my calculator out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** I'm going to wait with bated breath.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Yeah, that's three.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** That's three total.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** Dude, how big is your calculator, man?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** That's like your whole desk.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** It's like one of the big ones with the big buttons.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** And it's so fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:03]** It got the number back so fast.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** I was like amazed by that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** All right.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:19]** So I think you see two of Rolu's hands go toward their ears, trying to cover, and Rolu bends over, scowling, trying to stay...

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** and focus and shakes their head.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:26]** And I think rule is going to take a guarded five foot step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** Okay, out of range of Asashla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:36]** Out of range of Asashla, and then as Rolu is shuffling back, their feet moving quickly, there's all this dust.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:51]** Rolu looks over and sees Chak being hurt pretty badly, so Rolu's going to use his last spell slot to cast Blessings of Youth on Chak again to make sure that Chak is able to at least take one more hit.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:08]** four points of healing as you see two of Rolu's other arms reach out and this white essence seems to flow across over to Chak and envelop Chak and give you four stamina points.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Four stamina points.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** Yeah, it's four stamina points.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:19]** And that is Rolu's turn, and hopefully at the end of my next turn, I will be on target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** That was a beautiful turn.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:25]** Maybe Rolu can paint as, again, somebody is stepping away from battle.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Yeah.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** And call it, like, retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** I also say, Rolo, where are you?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Sorry, I'm talking to myself.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Thaddeus, where are you?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** You sound so freaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Keep talking to yourself all the time, John.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** I really do.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** No one knows who anyone is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** Sorry, can you say that again, Thaddeus?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** I didn't hear you.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Shut up, Rolo.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** I can't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** What?

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:57]** Also, I just want to say if anyone was in the Navy, for example, and was on a submarine all the time, it's not like the submarine was just constantly going forward and other submarines or other ships the entire time.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** It would probably, you know, move around tactically, wouldn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:01]** It would.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** Well, fun fact is submarines have to move forward or else they're sinking.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** So the only time I've ever gone, I almost died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:11]** But if you want to get into that, we can get into the technicalities of what you mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** So basically submarines are sharks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** So there's no retreating.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** That's right.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** There's no retreating.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** All right.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** That's my turn.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** It's not in our comm manual.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** Termay, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** I'm going to try something, guys.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:36]** And I'm going to stand up over this dead goblin here.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:41]** And I'm going to touch him, casting grave words.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** I'm going to speak to the Akeshdi Rivener in front of us.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:52]** And I'm going to say to him, You're dealing with powers you do not understand.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:59]** Turn back now or face a greater threat than you've ever realized.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:05]** And then hopefully the dead body will talk to him and say something rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:12]** I think Grave Ward just repeats the last six seconds.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:22]** It's six seconds of whatever random thing he... And if it's helpful, if... D percentage.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** So like 10% chance of him.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** One in 10.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** not helpful.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Okay.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** But it does reanimate the body, right?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:38]** Yeah, what does the body say?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:54]** This goblin that was just smashed into the ground, his bones kind of like rattled together just enough to like support him and he goes... And then he falls back dead again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** That's amazing acting, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** But let me... And then I'm going to take a guard and step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:08]** Like all of us do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** We all start retreating.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Okay.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:14]** And the skill I guess I'm trying to do is lie, but like a bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:17]** I don't know if you want to... Yeah, go ahead and give me a bluff roll.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** And I'm going to pose it with my will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** I got a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:25]** And I don't... There's no way I can beat that, so...

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Uh, I'm going to get a minus.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** I'm going to give a minus something to something or else for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** It's a little startled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** A little shaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** All right.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** That's your turn.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** That is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** I mean, I moved a step back.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** I gave him the warning.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** I did a guarded step.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** I gave him the warning.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** I touched the dead body.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** And then I took a step back.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** That was good.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** That was called being smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** I like it a lot.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** And for that, I'll give you a minus.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** You're giving me a minus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** You could also make them flat-footed.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** That's the faint ability in Bluff.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Yeah, where they are now flat-footed.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** But there's a whole thing about it.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Just giving you options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** What is flat-footed?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Minus two to AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, I think it's minus two to AC.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:22]** I think, I mean, to be fair, I think I really just lied to him because I tried to deceive him.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I think it worked, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** I think it was effective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:29]** Minus two to AC, can't take reactions or make AOLs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:40]** Just a fun fact is that the Sakeshni Rivner does not have goblin as one of their languages, so she has no idea what he said when he woke up.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** What did he say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** That is terrifying not knowing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Do you speak goblin?

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** I can tell you if you speak goblin.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Actually?

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** Nope.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Uh-huh.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Yeah, get out of here.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Moving on.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** It is now Chuck's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:57]** I'm looking for my languages so I can see if I speak goblin.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Can anyone check, please?

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** I don't speak goblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Roll it.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** I speak six languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** No one cares about Space Goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** That's why none of us like... 100,000 fake points if you can tell me what musical that's from.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** I didn't hear it.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** So someone will hear it on the episode.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Hopefully.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** Or they won't because my singing is terrible.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:31]** Chuck is going to take a couple of steps up yonder to the northwest.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:35]** So Thaddeus has strategically run away.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:40]** He says it's a retreat, but I'm curious what he screams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Retreat!

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Retreat!


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Retreat!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** I'm curious where his tail is.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:58]** And I'm going to flip a 180 and pop a shot at this big old Rivener with my fast vault blaster.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Amazing.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Nice.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:10]** And I'm rolling my tiny D20 from North to South Designs because I really like tiny dice right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Yeah, tiny dice are kind of cool.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** They are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** I'm a fan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** North-south design.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** That is... Flatfoot is a minus four to strengthen decks.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Sorry.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** I always forget what flatfooted is.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** What is that, buddy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** I was like, what did I do?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Did I step on a trap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:30]** No, I was just... Did you stumble into the matrix of awesomeness?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Yeah.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** I fell into the digital domain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Digimon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** Did Digimon come over and save the day?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** That is a 19 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:44]** Oh, that definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** I don't care what it's for.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Yeah.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Give me some damage.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** For eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** Eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** I really like these tiny dice.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Yo-ho.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** They ship them in these tiny glass cork stoppered vials.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** That's cool.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Yeah, they're really dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** That's rad.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** That's beautiful stuff, man.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:10]** You shoot her like right in the gut.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** And her giant claw comes in.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** And she actually almost claws herself when she's like.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** Shoot her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** Shoot her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** But she's still standing.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** And now it's her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** No, it was Sushla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:43]** She's going to just look across the entire battlefield and slowly look back across everybody.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:51]** And so far, it's Bomb Gozzle to the left, Roller to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** And she's stuck in the middle with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** She's stuck in the middle with you.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:02]** But I'm going to roll a d6 to see who she attacks because she's almost ravenous at this point.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Can I roll a d6 for you?

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** She's almost ravenous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Is that a condition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Almost ravenous, yep.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** That's a three on the dice.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** That is going to be Treme.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** She's a thirteenth roll.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Shiza!

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Hey, I thought I said don't attack me.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Turn back now.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:22]** Onto the goblin that just rose up and spoke.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:27]** She just steps forward and her foot is the size of the entire goblin and just crushes him.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** There's nothing left of her.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** But she's going to move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** If I can move my... Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** Oh, no, that was... Oh, she stepped on Rulu.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Rulu got attached to him.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** He got caught on the claws.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** You're always getting stuck on stuff, Rulu.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Getting caught all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** She's going to roll to strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** Question.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Yeah, question.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** I think she would have a... Does Bomb Guzzle have reach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** Yeah, also, doesn't Rulu get an AOL?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** No, because I moved into his area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** But you're attacking?

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** I think you're right.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** You did cross through.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** That's fine, I can just stay there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** No, no, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:18]** And then from there I'm moving into... Yeah, no, you're fine.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:22]** That is only a 12 on the dice.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** That's a miss!

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:39]** She's still like one hand, one claw is over her gut where she took the shot and her other claw reaches out for you and just like you see the blades come right in front of your face.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** You don't have enough time to think about it, but like you just move back.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Oh, that would hurt.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Slice.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** It's like watching a car crash in slow motion.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Shoo!

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** And that's the end of her turn.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** It is now Bomb Gozzle's turn.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:35:54 - 00:36:00]** And Bomb Gozzle is going to raise his junk, mega junk laser one more time.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** Those are pistons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** Other bearings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** There's lots of bearings.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Lots of bearings.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** There's bearings in everything.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Lots of bearings.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Lots of balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Lots of balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Yes, lots of balls in each bearing.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** There's lots of bearings.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** There's lots and lots of balls.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:23]** At Bomb Gozzle, I got to find my little tiny... Does it shoot bearings?

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** I'm going to use... What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** That is a 24 to hit.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Oh, yes.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** Her AC is a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:39]** Why did you do all this info on this monster?

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** Well, I'm telling you because... It's dead.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** All the steam comes out of his gun.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:58]** And that beam comes out and just hits her in the back shoulder across the neck area.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** She lets out a yelp.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:15]** And like you, you not only hear a Sasha hit the ground, but you feel it.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** And the rest of the battlefield does too.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** The warring pauses.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Everyone stops.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:30]** And the Akestis all stand stunned that their leader just fell.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** No need to end this way, Asashla.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:41]** And then Bomb Gozzle turns to the Akestis that are still fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** And no need to fight each other.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** The true enemies...

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** are right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** And he points at you.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Specifically at Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Whoops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:07]** And the goblins all return the phrase, But they are hesitant to re-engage in combat and they stand by with their weapons still pointed at the Akestis because they don't trust them yet.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** And the Akestis stand there with energy swirling around in their hands.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** And it's going to be Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Okay.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** We're out of initiative order, right?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Oh, no, no, we're still in initiative order.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Baumgasl just threatened us, dude.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** I know.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:33]** I literally don't think Thaddeus is well-equipped for this kind of thing.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:38]** You spoke a little too harshly there, Baumgasl.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Hold on.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:43]** Thaddeus is just going to try to be diplomatic because he has no f***ing clue what to do.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** All right, he rolled a 20.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** So that's a new one for him.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:51]** But he's just like, look, you have us all wrong.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** We're doing true and spitting.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Shaq is kind of a moron.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** You have to just take, you know, what he says with a grain of salt.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** I'm serious, all right?

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Look, we're here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** We're on your side.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:07]** We're going to help you get what you want from inside there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** So just to clarify, you're rolling diplomacy for that?

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** Yeah.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Or bluff.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** It's diplomacy.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:19]** I'm going to need a bluff from that because you said that you are doing Trillian's brilliant thing, which is a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:24]** You're right.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** I did just totally lie.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** It's a 19, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:29]** Okay.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** Do you want to do anything else on your turn?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:41]** He wants to see how difficult it might be to open up the airlock, and he can't do that because he's not trained in anything related to that.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** So never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:50]** Well, you would know for sure that Merck and Keshe were working on the key that you guys went out and risked your lives to get.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:53]** So it's not like you're going to be able to open it on your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:58]** Thaddeus is just going to ready to shoot them if anything happens, but he's going to keep his gun disguised.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** He's not going to make it too obvious.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** And that's the end of round number five, I think.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Four, five, whatever.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** It's round six.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** It's another round somewhere.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** Rolu, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** So Asasha is dead, correct?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Do you want to do a medicine check?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:29]** No, I just couldn't tell because I thought they were dead, but then it seemed like Bomb Gozzle was talking to us also?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:33]** No, Bomb Gozzle was talking about us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:38]** Yes, but Baumgasl mentioned something and it seemed like Baumgasl said something to Asashla.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** So I'm asking Kevin for clarification.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Was that him talking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** Yes, Baumgasl spoke to Asashla.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:49]** Whether or not she is dead or alive is something you have to determine yourself.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** And I'll give you, you can either do an engineering check by poking her with a stick or you can do a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Rulu doesn't care too much per se.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I just wanted to clarify.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:14]** Rolu instead takes a step forward and looks at Baumgasl and lowers his bottom two hands that were holding his rifle.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:22]** And he says, there are many reasons to fight Baumgasl.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** We, as Thaddeus have said, are not your enemy anymore.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:41]** And at this moment, there is an uneasy truce and peace and pause between your enemies, these Keshtis, and the... Shoot, what's the name of your group again?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** You don't even know!

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** The Trash Hunters, yes.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Sorry, sorry.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** They're on my side.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Look at them.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** We are also on your side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:54]** You foreigners, you don't belong here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** And you killed our deity.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** We didn't kill your deity.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** How do you kill a deity?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** We were sent from the stars by him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** I don't know about that part, Thaddeus.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** No, we weren't.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** We weren't.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Shut up.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** No.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** We did not kill your deity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:21]** And we are able... I'm pretty sure he admitted he killed... We are able to work with you.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** I did kill... See, I told you.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** He's saying it.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** He's saying it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** He's saying it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** I killed him.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** What did he just say?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Watch out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:30]** There is no reason for more bloodshed.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Through the chin.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Just talk... Just talk over, Shaq.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Just talk over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** No, no, just... There is no reason for more bloodshed, Palm Guzzle.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** We do not need to be enemies.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** And I'm sure whatever...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:41 - 00:43:07]** results you want for the trash hunters we might be able to help you we after all yes i'm interrupting your turn rolu but i was gonna roll diplomacy yes do that just do do that do that yeah and i wanted to make sure that i i thought i had something special for that but i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** It's a 25.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Oh, that's very nice.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Then what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Wait.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Are you trying to change his attitude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Yeah, technically.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Because that's a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Yeah, and I took a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** Oh, by the way, Kelly, technically that's a standard action too, so you couldn't even ready an action after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:31]** I took a guarded step forward next to Asasha.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** And then I gave that soliloquy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** That's the end of your turn.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Terme, it's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Terme is going to...

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** Sashay over to the dead Akesh-T in front of him.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Sashay.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** In your robe or some s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Swaying around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** There's a boss in the background.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Reach down.

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:00]** Touch the Akesh-T.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Cast grave words again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** What are you doing?

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:09]** And I'm going to say to Bomb Gozzle, I'm going to say, Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:16]** Don't make the same mistake that your friend here made.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:26]** And then, so I'm trying to, I guess, bluff into...

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Not being hostile.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** So I'm trying to lie.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** I don't know.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Intimidate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Do a bluff check.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:33]** Yeah.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Or intimidate.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** Yeah, I guess that could be intimidate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Let's go intimidate.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** Yeah, it's better.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** What's my intimidate?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** 17.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** Yeah, it's probably good.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** It's not the best.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** I really just like grave words.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** It's such a fun spell.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** You just want it to finally be useful information one of these days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Yeah, one day it'll be useful.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Maybe it'll be now.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** But it'll always be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:16]** This large mass of red scales and blood and blisters, laser blisters, shakes back to life just enough to say...

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** Death to all.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Lame.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** And then it falls dead.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** I mean, that's pretty cool.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** That's basic.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** That's better ways to say it.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Bomb gozzle.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Is that the end of your turn?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** That's the end of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:34]** I mean, that was only my standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Okay, so do you want to move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Yeah.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** I thought you moved.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** I'm going to move.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Well, no.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:45]** I mean, I'm already within... You're walking away with less confidence if you came in.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** This is just for flavor, Vinny.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Flavor your way out, though.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** I want to hear you.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:57]** I'm going to move north some distance.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Bit of soft shoe going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:05]** You could do what Roloo does, that weird little, like, you know, dune walk.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** It's kind of classic Roloo.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** What do I do?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** You should move it like a little, like, wax on, wax off thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Yeah, I was going to say, if you go to the door, it's a 25-foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:24]** All right, I'm going to go above the door, around it, to get above the high ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:32]** Now it's just Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:36]** It's actually Choc's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Don't try it.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:43]** There's this principle I learned about recently where it's like if you kind of have it in the bag, don't push it too much.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** You know what I mean?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** So just kind of keep that in mind.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** I think we're doing all right.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** You did push it right before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** And by the way, I recommend hashtag runaway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:56]** I think it's called you know

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Anyway, go ahead.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Shock is going to step forward.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:03]** Look, guys, there's been a lot of blood spilled today.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** And junk parts, but mostly blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Look at Kev.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Kev's in a giggly mood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** No more needs be spilled.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:26]** If Tryon believes that you need another Tinkerton, Tryon will send another Tinkerton.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:32]** As you pointed out, we're not from around here, and we'd like to be on our way as quickly as possible.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** Allow us to finish what we're doing here, and we'll be out of your hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:42]** Are you going to take your standard action to roll a buff check on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** I'm going to go, I would say diplomacy, because no part of that was followed.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** That's not really bluffing, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** That's the gospel truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** Yeah.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Amen.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Praise to you.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** That's an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:05]** I really just want to kill you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** I know.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** His face, man, all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:10]** Actually, it's kind of the opposite.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** I am trying to justify why not.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** And there's nothing.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** There's nothing you can tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** You can't treat him.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** Not exactly.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:30]** I'm pretty sure you said you shot him right to the jaw, and it was like, boom.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** Yeah, Tickerton, not Triune.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Triune is still around.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** As far as I know, the Triune still is.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** But Tickerton was like the embodiment of Triune here on Akiton.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** We don't need to argue that tonight.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Triune is very theological.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** Are we arguing Triune theology?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Yeah.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** Yeah.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** The Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** They all turn to Will.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Everybody on the field turns to Will and goes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:54 - 00:49:02]** Treme's going to get a parchment out and nail 99 DCs onto the door of the Triune.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** The ship.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Church.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:16]** But I honestly think there's nothing... At this point, you're basically fighting a cultist, and there's nothing you can say to him that's going to stop him from trying to kill you.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Especially you, Chuck.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** And he's going to roll to shoot.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:29]** His junk laser then turns from the dead body of Asashla, which... Kevin would have took two more shots at that thing if it came alive, but...

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** I think Bomb Gozzle's a little better than me.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** And he points it at you.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** And he rolls.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Does a 22 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** I don't know what game you think we're playing.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Yeah, it's a 22.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** Yeah, he just does that for the fun of it.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** He's like, I don't know.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** Does a 30, like, you know, get past your case here?

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, no, it totally doesn't.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Does a 37 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** Yeah, uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** You guys are level 70, right?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** You're at like three health.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** What's a CR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** What's the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Well, it's a plus three.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:06]** Okay.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** So even if I roll a one on this, you're down.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Roll the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Wait, no.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Oh, because you gave him back.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Maybe.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Roll the damage.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** It is five points of damage.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** You good, son.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** I am good.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** You live.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** I got one stamina and I got one health.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Get that.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Get it.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** So he shoots you with...

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:44]** see the pistons moving and he goes, but if you're close enough, it's not that loud.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Cause he's small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Yeah.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:59]** Uh, but he actually is going to move down over there around like away from a Sasha's body and like a little bit closer, just a little bit closer, uh, to the, you see like four or five of checks leaves wilt away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:07]** And he's like, you can see he's still up on his feet, but it's like, uh, like, uh, uh,

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** If he was in the NFL, he would be in the concussion protocol right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Yeah.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Fair.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Thaddeus, it's now your turn.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** I'm trying to remember.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** Soldiers can quick reload, right?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Quick reload?

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** I think so.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Sorry about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:25]** That sounds like a skill of some sort.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** Look it up.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Looking it up right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** But, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Looking it up right now.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** It's not really easy to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:37]** You can reload this weapon as part of the same action as firing it.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** Instead of taking a move action to reload, which soldiers can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** I'm pretty sure that's a feat you have to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:50]** It's not... Maybe so.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** You're not, like, the ultimate soldier just because you are a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** I mean, I'm pretty good, though.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** You know, I can handle weapons.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** You all can't.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:07]** So I'm going to kind of... So Thaddeus is going to move... He's going to, like, move south-west a bit.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** He's going to try to get close to Bom... Gozzle?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Yeah.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** There we go.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** Right behind Shaq, so he can maybe help Shaq if needs be.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** And he's going to fire... F***.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** I need to reload.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** So he's got to reload.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** He's going to reload here.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Not quite near him.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** And he's out of range of him.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** Or behind the giant beast.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** And he reloads.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** That's what he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** You can still shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:38]** No, because I moved and reloading is a move action, so I can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Is reloading a move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** That's what I understand.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** If I can't quick reload, then yeah, it's a move action.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** That's what it says.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** On the interwebs.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** On the interwebs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Missiles.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Ammunition.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** All right.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** You can trust me, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** This isn't even in my favor at all.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** It takes a move action.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** So you're moving and reloading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Yeah.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** So that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** All right.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** All right.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** That is now Tremay's turn.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Where did we leave off?

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Oh, then he just adds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** Yeah, he just says, like, well, I would have done the same anyway.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** That's all.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** That's the end of his turn.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Commenting on them.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** I mean, you're not going to let something like that go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I think it's like round seven now.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Rolu, you're up.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:32]** Rolu's shoulders drop at the overt aggression from Bomb Guzzle.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** It was unnecessary.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:37]** And seeing Bomb Guzzle start to move towards...

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:56]** move towards chak rolu is going to trot quickly turn over and run through the red sand in front of chak and say you've made a mistake bum guzzle and then raise my azimuth serpent laser

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:02]** And in a very menacing way, I take a shot and I roll the two.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:11]** So I look really intimidating as I stand there in a power stance in front of Chuck.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** And miss.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** And fire wildly.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** And with a two, you're not even close.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** You're just like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** You shouldn't have done this.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Guns in the air.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Shoot straight up in the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Yeah.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** I'll get you as you shoot, like you empty a bag into the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Real cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** It's like you fired from the hip, but you've never fired from the hip before.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Right.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** Yeah.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** Don't try to be badass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Yeah.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** So... It doesn't work.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:51]** Treme is going to just...

**[00:54:51 - 00:55:06]** look at this scene and sort of wait for maybe them to kind of close in more, and hopefully we can get some strategic advantage on them by enveloping them in a, you know, like a pizza moment or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Are you suggesting you're going to delay your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:14]** I'm going to cast Misfire, and I'm going to stay put.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** Ooh.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:17]** I'm going to cast Misfire on Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:24]** So that's going to be a will save, I think.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Okay.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Will save.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Will save.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** To negate the effects of Misfire.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Is it a 14 pass?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** God dang it.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** Dang it.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** What a waste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** I'll try again.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Are you going to move at all?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** No?

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** All right.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** Chuck, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** What are you going to do?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:53]** Chuck is going to not take a five-foot step closer.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Chuck is going to take a five.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** Nope.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:01]** Chuck's not going to move because I want to use his move action to do something else.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:05]** Chuck is going to use his move action to further heckle Bomb Guzzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** fine at this point, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** I'll be honest.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Chuck's my favorite character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** He's amazing.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** He's the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** Triune clearly didn't deem you worthy, otherwise he wouldn't have taken Tinkerton from you.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** And that's his... You took Tinkerton!

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** That's his not-in-the-face action.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Make a DC 14.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Ready to save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** That's a fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Yeah.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** Oh, not in the face.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** So what is it not in the face for you?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** It's a minus four penalty to attacks against me.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** Nice.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** Nice.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** And then I'm going to actually move to here.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Right in front.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** Right in front of us.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Let's get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Dude, you're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:18]** man it is bomb god like for for the audience and for the rest of the party before i do like crazy crap like this i always roll a wisdom save uh like those video thus far in this session it's been a two and a three yeah and and also chalk has a minus four to wisdom yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** Are you trying to kill off Shaq because you're bored of him?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** Because I feel like he's really coming into himself as a character.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Oh, he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Don't do it.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** Don't do it.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Let him live.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** He won't die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** We'll replant him.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** He's like Groot.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** He won't actually die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:38]** I love your false brevity.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Bravado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:44]** Because he's effectively a fern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** So that is a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** It's a minus four to attack rolls.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:56]** So does a 23 hit?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** It's an 18.

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** What's an 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** My math came to 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** What do you do?

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Is it Bob Gozzle's turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** An attack roll.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** It is Bob Gozzle's turn after chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** And his laser just kind of tracks as chalk moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** Even after that statement, it is an 18 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Including your minus four for not in the face.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** That hits.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** I'm assuming that hits.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** Yes, that hits.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** Oh, no.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** All right.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** Jack is fighting out, as the kids say.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:42]** And that is eight points of damage.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:51]** As you move, you make a smart aleck response, and his shoulder laser just kind of follows you across the field.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** And as soon as you stop, it pulls and goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** So, like, at that point, the scene goes to slow motion.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:05]** And, like, the camera has a hard pan around from, like, Bomb Guzzle's perspective.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** You see the projectile come out as it, like, fires across the field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Of ten feet.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Yeah, ten feet.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Ten feet in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** Ten feet.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:25]** And, like, you see the impact reverberate through all of the foliage on Jack's chest.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** And you see him recoil.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** And he sways and he bobs.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:38]** But eventually you see his eyes roll back and he falls to the ground unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** No.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** And then Treme runs over and says grave words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** And that's our game.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Oh, wow.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Wow.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Well, I... All right.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** That was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:09]** Until next week, drift be gods and distant stars.
