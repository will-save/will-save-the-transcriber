**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:57 - 00:00:58]** Kev.

**[00:00:58 - 00:00:58]** Kev.

**[00:00:58 - 00:00:59]** Kev, where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:59 - 00:00:59]** Kev.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:00]** Kev.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:00]** I'm here.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** I was just opening my Dr. Pepper.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** Got to prep.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]** You did it right.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:06]** I thought it was going to be louder than that.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:08]** I thought it would be like the whole, like they do in the commercials.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:09]** It wasn't like that.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:10]** We'll fix it in post.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:12]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** We'll make it really over the top.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** We will.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** Like geyser.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:20]** Crispus Dr. Pepper, you can imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Ever.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Ever.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** So good.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** Well, welcome back.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** It's Will Saban, the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** I'm Kevin.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** This is Unknown Treasures, episode 41.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** That's right.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:32]** 41.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:39]** I'm the only person in the world that can turn a small book into an adventure that lasts 15 years.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** It was teamwork, dude.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** But you're doing a great job.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Thank you.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** It was teamwork.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** Yeah.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** It's almost an entire year of episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** You know, I was thinking about this, though.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** Like, we play this game, you know, we definitely play the game for the listeners.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** Like, we play it for you, and we appreciate you guys listening.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** But, like, we also play for ourselves.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** We play for fun.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Okay, well.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:12]** But I was thinking, like, man, I used to buy video games, and when I only made $15 an hour or whatever it was way back when, I would buy a video game and be like, man, I paid $60 for this thing, but I got 90 hours out of it or 120 hours.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** And I would break it down.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Like, was it worth playing?

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:19]** And so you guys are getting your money's worth by me extending this game.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Yeah, you really are.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** I mean, if we weren't recording this podcast, nobody would complain that it was taking this long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** To be fair, like, not every long game is good.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** I'm not trying to, like... What are you saying, Kelly?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** Sometimes games are too 15 innings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Isn't it fun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** I don't know.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I don't watch sports, man.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** I don't know anything about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** You don't want to play, like, three-day-long cricket games?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Can you play three days of cricket?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Are they really three days long?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Oh, you could play, like, probably weeks of cricket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** It's theoretically unlimited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:48]** I don't know all the rules fully, but the test, I think they do multiple days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** So cricket is like the real-life Quidditch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Basically, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:58]** It just ends on like one bullshit thing if you just do this one thing the entire game ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** Yeah, it's however many overs they bowl or whatever.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Yeah, what is the snitch?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** Is that the snitch?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Is that what it's called?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** The snitch wouldn't end.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:14]** Yeah, except cricket is longer because there is no snitch to actually just end the game quickly.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:20]** I should invent that rule for sure so they can just end cricket.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:48]** uh british people and everyone in the commonwealth sorry just please let us know if you actually watch like cricket yeah i'm curious like who actually is it like a thing for real cricket that common i've been watching cricket i know it's big in india where where do you watch it but it's on espn so so it's on a streaming service that will go nameless but it does start with my four it's willow okay i should shouldn't have said it but it's willow uh

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Shout out to Willow.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** That's a network?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Yeah, it's a streaming service.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Why is it secretive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Nice.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:58]** I just didn't want to promote them, but I mean, I guess now I do.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** I just already did.

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** Yeah.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** Then there's no way to go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** There's no way to go back.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** What?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** You should give me a free membership, free months.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** That's right.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** Willow, because I just shouted you out.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:15]** No, I've been watching BBL highlights and stuff from the Australian League.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** What's BBL?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** There's no cricket in BBL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:23]** Yeah, there's no C. British, but cricket?

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** No, it's like Big Bash League.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:37]** It's basically cricket for cool people where the rules make no sense and there's craziness all around and there's power plays type things.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** There's all kinds of cool...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** It's like a variation of T20.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:48]** So this is like the NFL Blitz of... That's what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** It's real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** And it's sponsored by KFC.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Wait, is it actually?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** That's hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** KFC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** I've got beef, man.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** It can be good, but it's not good here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** You've got beef with KFC?

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** They don't serve it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Yeah, just eat chicken, dude.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Here's my deal.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:13]** So KFC retired the best side in fast food, the KFC potato wedge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Oh, no.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** That was the only reason I went there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** That's the only reason I went there, too.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** I've not been back since.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Rightfully so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** You should go to Popeye's.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** I stand by you.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** The fries at Popeye's are very that seasoning ilk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:28]** But it's not a wedge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** It's not the wedge.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** You can't reheat it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** The density is off.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** The flavor distribution is weird.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** The texture is different.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** If I wanted a fry, I'd go someplace different entirely.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** I feel like McDonald's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** I think my favorite choice of fries is curly fries.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Arby's?

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** Arby's curly fries are really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Arby's is good.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Zaxby's seasoned fries are close to the top for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Is Jack in the Box also has curly fries?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** They do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Yeah, those are pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Solid.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Good stuff.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** I like the Carl's Jr.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** slash Hardee's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** Hardee's?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Yep.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** Chris Cutts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** I don't know if there's a Hardee's near me.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** Chris Cutts are good.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** There's like Chick-fil-A's Chris Cutts.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Hardee's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:16]** Dude, Hardee's had a, they called it a monster breakfast sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:28]** It was ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, two things of egg on like the Hardee's biscuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** We're going to make everyone so hungry right now.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** We are.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** I haven't eaten dinner.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** I'm starving.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** How much sodium is there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** There's got to be like 80 grams of sodium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** I think the one sandwich was like 3,000 calories.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:47]** But that was like my, I would only get it when I would go on a road trip.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** And that was like my road trip, leaving the house breakfast.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** Cause like you eat that and you're not hungry for the rest of the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** That's it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** Amazing.

**[00:06:59 - 00:06:59]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Man, that was a good sandwich.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Carl's Jr.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** had the $6 burgers that were...

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Nothing to complain about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:11]** It's a $15 burger for $6, but I really liked Carl's Jr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Is it $6 still?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Inflation-wise, probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** $6 burger for $8.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** I don't think they call them that anymore, but they still have some of them around.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Yeah, once inflation hits, you can't call it that anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:27]** And speaking of trying to survive, let's play Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** What a segue that was.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** You really brought the energy with that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** I took that personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** You're up and alive though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** For now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** Let's just recap.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:52]** Last time, the ghostly Lashunta slashed Rolu then faded through the wall.

**[00:07:52 - 00:08:10]** rolu then snatched up poor unconscious chalk and pulled a thaddeus by back flipping away from the danger termay then tossed a grenade and slammed the door shut on the second creature i didn't do anything though we'll learn that later moot just wasted a level two mark two grenade that was yeah that was moot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:15]** I want to take a moment to appreciate that running away from a fight is now pulling at that.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** It is.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** It is.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** Hold on.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** We are at episode 42, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Back in the other room.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** 41.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** We're on 41.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:23]** 41.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:32]** So, back in the other room, Chalk was able to stay in the fight and get back up right as the first ghost came back into the room.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Okay.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** and knocked him down again.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** You figured out that these things are actually incorporeal and this fight wasn't going to be easy.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** So you teamed up.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:45]** Torme took out the first one, the man with the long black hair with three magic missiles.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** That's right.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** And then you all turned your focus on the Lashunta.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** She then turned on Torme and scored a critical hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** Yes.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** That we haven't resolved.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** Right.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** Wonder why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** That's where we left off.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:04]** That is core of this starting... I don't know what to say.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** Words of blank.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** What?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:09]** Anyways, question is, democracy, do we use... Democracy?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** What?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Do we use... This is not a democracy, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** What does this have to do with choosing our representative leaders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** We're going to decide whether or not we use the critical card for this, or do I just roll double damage?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** So...

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** We usually roll and use the critical cards.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** I'm voting for the critical cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** For flavor, we do, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** And who knows?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:31]** It might keep you alive, Will, if it works the same way that happened to you on your last critical.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** I'm sure it will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** So you got to call the vote?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:38]** Is the decision between double damage or card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** It's double damage and card or double damage.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** I vote card, though, I think.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** That's three for card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:54]** I'm going to vote against the card because I want... The card says a critical hit deals double damage to the target unless the entry says it deals normal damage or triple damage.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** This is a critical attack against who?

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Termite?

**[00:09:59 - 00:09:59]** Me.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** So you don't care because you're Thaddeus.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Well, no, no, no.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** But it's like... Shut up.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** How dare you?

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Like, you don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Like...

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:25]** i think it should be just kevin i don't think this is a democracy i think that you are just well i think democracy voted kaiser three to two uh well damage sounds like anything else would be good so it's not three two it's three one three one zero three one one yeah three one one because i'm not gonna no i don't i don't believe in voting it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** At all.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Okay.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Come on, Will.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** It's just a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** I don't believe in democracy.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** So let's do the double damage first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Okay.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Nine.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Of all times to abstain.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Of all times to abstain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** I just don't believe in democracy.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Just to mess with you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** So 14 damage.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Keep that on record.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** I'll type it up somewhere so we don't forget.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** 14.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** I should probably open my character sheet and apply this, huh?

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Yeah.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** So I think I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Hold on.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Let's wait.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:00]** Maybe the critical card will be like, none of that goes through, but then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** But you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Who knows?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** Let's see.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Let's see.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** What kind of attack is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** So I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Shoot.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** It's against EAC.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** So it's an energy attack, right?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** It's a melee attack, but it's incorporeal.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** So does that change things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** Is it an energy kinetic or spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** It is a melee attack that targets EAC.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** I don't know what else to do for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** So it's an energy attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Yes.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** I guess so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Yes.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** Okay.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** But what kind of damage?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** What is the damage?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** Slashing.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Slashing.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** Okay.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** So it's kinetic.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** All right.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** Ready?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Here we go.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** All right.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** Instead of that, I want the 41st card from the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Count the 41st.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Do it.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** We're going to be here for the next minute and a half.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** John used to be a dealer in Vegas.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:49]** I got that already cut.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** We need to hear this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** I'm making stuff up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** I can see that.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** I can see that happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:03]** I don't think he graduated because he couldn't pass a background check on the Nevada Gaming Commission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** I'm going to laugh really hard if there's only 40 cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** This is the card.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** There's a 41st card.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Kinetic damage.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:36]** run away that's the title of it are you serious bonus effect the attack has the automatic weapon special property i don't get how this combines with run away but the attack is the automatic weapon special property core rulebook 180 okay let's go to core rulebook automatic it's basically you do a full attack and it forces the creature to run away okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** I truly don't know how runaway and the description match.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:45]** Is it probably like it's automatic, like I don't have any control over it maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** It looks like automatic is a ranged weapon attribute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** Yeah, so I think it just doesn't apply here.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** It doesn't do anything.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Yeah, because yours is a melee.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Them's the cards!

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** What does it say?

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Automatic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** No, read automatic, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:07]** So for that crit, I guess it would attack in a cone with half the range instead of attacking a single character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Ah, that makes sense.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** For the entire weapons remaining ammunition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Behind you?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Because he's just targeting... Yep.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Okay, that makes... I can see that.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:27]** So, like, the crit is that the slash is then expanded to a cone and targeting more people.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Yes.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:31]** So it doesn't apply anyways because there's nobody behind Jermaine.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** He's up against the wall.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** So give us the result.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** What does 14 damage do to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** That puts me down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Jermaine, you're down?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Puts you down.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** Will is down, Jermaine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Yeah, I was going to ask you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Oh, I'm sorry, man.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** I'm bad at GMing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** That's not true.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** You're fine at GMing.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** You just suck at Roll20.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Yeah, the maps are not good.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** It's the multitasking thing.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** I just can't do more than one thing at a time.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I think you guys are on the map now.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** What's going on?

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** What's the situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:09]** Tremé's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Tremé's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** Tremé's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Tremé's down.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Tremé's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Rollo, he's down.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** I know.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** I saw.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Thank you for the obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Rollo, you don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** I'm taller than you are.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Wait, really, really?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** That's enough.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:37]** Rollo's going to take a five foot step past the desk.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:42]** And almost just brush everything off the desk as two of his other hands come up.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** And you see the heat start to collect around his hands.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:55]** And he is strategically placing himself so that way the 15-foot cone from overheat ends at this friggin' Lashunta.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:00]** And he says, May you find peace in hell.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:08]** And then shoot overheat at this drift dead mother.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** What's up, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:13]** I was just commenting that Rolly, that is the best line Rolly has ever said to me.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** I just lost my roll 20.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** How did that happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Thanks, Thaddeus.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:21]** Well, Rolly, I have to say, for once in your life, you were a badass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** You'll get there one day, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:32]** In the reflection of Thaddeus' eyes, you just see this pillar of flame engulf this mother****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** And for a few seconds, Thaddeus is like, I like that.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** He's like, ****.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** All right.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:43]** Kev, you need to make a reflex saving throw whenever you get Roll20 back up online.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** It's so good.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** That had nothing to do with it.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** That was my browser, strictly my browser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:50]** Okay, well, stop using Opera and get on to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** Kevin is notorious for not upgrading or doing anything.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:02]** He's still got Netscape just chilling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Kevin's like, have you heard of DSL?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Oh my god, man.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** I have a 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** That's a fail.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** That's a fail.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** 2 sixes.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** 12 points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** So that's halved because it's incompatible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** You don't have to tell us that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** I'm just reminding you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:24]** You didn't have to rain on my literal fire parade.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Fire parade.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:28]** So it is still up after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Dude, for real though.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Still up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Is it looking okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** Just hovering over Termay's unconscious body.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Termay, your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** What are you doing?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** I'm going to spend an RP to stabilize.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Okay.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** I guess.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** Unless, John, you had your hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Not that I can metagame, but.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** My turn's already passed.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** I was going to do some information on this.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** Lashinta drifted after seeing that it was still up after my attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** Too bad.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Time's passed.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** You said so.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Hand off the chess piece.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Treme, you're staying alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Yep.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Is that your whole turn?

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** I don't know if you get to do two.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** I think so, right?

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Am I allowed to do anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** I believe so, too.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Vinny should know by now.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:03]** Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** I don't have my core over the kill front of me.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Nope.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** You basically have to do that by the end of your turn, or you lose a resolve point, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** All right, so that is his whole turn.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:14]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** So I'm just going to stay in this, I think.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:20]** I'm meditating is what I'm doing.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** Do I do anything mechanically in roll 20?

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Nope.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** No?

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** You take the X off of you if you want.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** Thaddeus shoots and misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** What did you roll?

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, wait, what did you shoot?

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Because you had your dash go out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** I switched, I'm sorry.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:47]** Thaddeus switches to his four-in-one Venom caster, pulls it out, shoots, rolls a two, but with his five modifier, it's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:57]** Either way, even if you scored a natural 20, your dart would shoot clean through this thing because it's incorporeal and kinetic attacks do not do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:21]** right i forgot that that's right but your dash goes energy weapon that's too bad your turns up are you gonna move yeah you're gonna move anywhere no you're gonna stand there okay chuck you're up what are you doing chuck with because this is all happening at the same time right yeah you see chuck like shutter and you can see like the veins in his leaves sort of stick it's sort of like how humans get goose pimples he got whatever the raxalite version of goose pimples from rolu's line

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** And so he's like, yeah, rest in hell.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** And fires his Thestval Blaster twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** Oh, the only weapon that can do damage without any penalties.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** I can't believe you bought that thing in the first place.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** But yeah.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** That's a four and a ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** Oh, and neither one hits.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Yeah, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Ouch.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** Kicks and Giggles does a 14 hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** It's targeting kinetic energy, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** No, EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** It would hit EAC.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Okay, cool.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** That's annoying.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** That's cool, yeah.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** Why did I just tell you that?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** If I had only attacked once, because I asked for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** Oh, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Because I asked.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Full action versus, yeah.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Yeah, if I had attacked once.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** Yeah, there's an interesting thing about that.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** That's how it'd be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** So with that, I think she didn't even notice the shots coming from either side.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** The dart went one way.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** The faster bolts went the other way.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:35]** And she did notice Rolu blow fire.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** And so she's going to move back.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Actually, no.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** She's going to just turn towards you.

**[00:19:43 - 00:20:00]** And shards of purple and pink tear away chunks of planar material as she pulls apart the molecular bonds of the matter around your body, ripping you apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** What?

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Monster start.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** I don't feel so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:10]** And that is 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:24]** yeah all right all right cool this might be uh yeah that hit i'm assuming i said yeah oh i rolled the wrong i i rolled you know it hits good

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Oh, oh, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** Oh, oh, oh.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** That's only three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** Yes.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Ha, ha.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Hey, guess how many hit points I have left.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:40]** Dodge the bullet, please, more than three.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Dude, no.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** You're down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** No, I have three left after your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Oh, my God, John.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Dude, phrasing.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Holy shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:58]** So she does that, her hand kind of whips up, and she just pulls basically drift material from you, and then she's going to just phase through the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** What the f***?

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** It's now Rollo's turn.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:10]** This is the most terrifying game of whack-a-mole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:20]** This is so frustrating, too, because all you can do with Incorporated Creatures is just, it is a straight, how much damage can I do?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:24]** Because it's going to be halved, or you've got to hope that it's going to go through.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** There's no special maneuver that you can do.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:51]** frustrating indeed all right uh rolu is going to ready an action that as soon as this moves in he is going to take two shots at this creature with his serpent lizard okay all right termay your yeah i'm gonna spend another rp and stay in the fight okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** And I think that's your full turn, right?

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:58]** Yeah, because last one I stabilized, and then this one, now I have one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** Yeah, so you're prone on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:07]** Yeah, and I'm just, as I come to, I'm just, whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** We got to get out of here, guys.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** I don't know about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** It's almost dead to me.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Just hang in there.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Just stay in the fight.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Can I move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** No.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** No.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Is that my whole turn?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I think you spend it at the end of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Okay.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Yeah.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Then that's it.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** That's all I do.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** All right.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** And I don't know.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Is that a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** To do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** To stabilize?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** To stay in the fight?

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** So could you stabilize and then move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:38]** Stay in the fight if you're able and have enough resolve points or if you were knocked unconscious from non-lethal damage.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:43]** You can spend one RP at the beginning of your turn to regain one HP.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** You are no longer dying.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:48]** Immediately become conscious and can take the rest of your normal turn as normal.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Oh, awesome.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Good thing I read that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:49]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** So I'm just going to move into the center of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** Oh, so you could get your full turn back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** Yeah.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:04]** And I'm going to ready an action to fire the... Is the frostbite zero class?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Is that going to go through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** It's an energy weapon, so it'll hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I hate to say it, I don't think you can ready an action.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** Because I think you have a move action to stand up, and then you have a move action to move.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Fair, fair, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Oh, okay.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** He can stand up and ready an action, or he can stand up and move.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Yeah.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** I'm just going to move to the center of the room because I don't want to be, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Targeted again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Targeted again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Okay, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** Yeah, I imagine Rolo's like, I think the way to fight this thing is to stick together.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** I agree.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Let's take this thing down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** What's your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** Thaddeus is going to try to maybe locate it.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Could he use perception to try to figure that out?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** Where it vanished to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Ooh.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:52]** I'm going to say it's a really high perception check, so I'll give you a try.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** It's a 17, though.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:04]** So you calm yourself, and you listen, and all you can hear is Tremé grunting and groaning as he crawls his way to the center of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** I stood up.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** I agree with Tremé.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** Stick together and wait for him to come to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** No, you don't hear anything.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Question.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** You didn't crawl.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** You're right.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:21]** Could I have stayed prone, crawled, and been able to ready an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Because I only moved like 15 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** Well, if you move prone, you only move 5 feet for a full move action.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:40]** I argue this is stupid because I got prone myself and crawled at least 20 feet within 2 seconds.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:46]** And then somebody was like, I think it was Adam from STF was like, well, you're not wearing a bunch of gear, but I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** Yo, I could crawl faster than that with a bunch of 80 pound ruck.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Come at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** By the rules, you could have only gone five feet.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** So, all right.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** You didn't perceive anything.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Thaddeus said.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** You didn't perceive anything useful is what I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:02]** Yeah.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Thaddeus said, like, I agree with Jermaine.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** Stick together and wait for him to come to us.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** This thing is insatiable.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** He'll come.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Or she'll come.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Whatever she is.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** It is.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** They are.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** And then he's going to, like, move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:18]** It's drawn to something, but it's definitely not that stupid statue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Move past Treme.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Yeah.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Agreed.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:26]** And going to be here so that we kind of form a bit of a circle, basically.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:31]** But for real, we're really close to the wire with our own health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Because we're all back to back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** That's the way to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Okay, so you're just moving?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Tactics, man!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** We're all back-to-back.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** You're just moving.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** I'm moving, and I'm switching to my Emberflame Dashka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** Okay, but that's a part of your move action, because you have a BAB now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Two actions.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:55]** Two move actions I take for my full turn, and then I'm telling Rulu, Rulu, use your weird magic wizardry to figure out where he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** But just question, like, what are your two actions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Because your movement... Move and switch weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** Your switch weapon is a part of your move action, because you can... Two move actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Yeah, you have a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** Oh, I guess you have to sheathe one as one action and then moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** If I move twice, that's my entire turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:16]** So what we're saying is... If you have a BAB... Yeah, if you have a base attack bonus, drawing a weapon doesn't cost you a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** But you had to put your other weapon away, so that would be sheathing.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** So you would sheathe one and then pull the other one while you're moving.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** So, yes, you're right.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** Okay.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** So, Chalk, what are you doing?

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** You're going to finish the circle?

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Because right now we have the... Yeah, I'm going to finish the circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:37]** Shaq really loudly racks what... Well, he thinks he's racking his asphalt blaster, but there's not actually a rack.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:41]** It's just him moving his hand back and forth and going...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** It's like an Avengers film.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:49]** It's just like the camera's just like slowly turning around us as we're all like looking to the side waiting for it to come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** I think we're more guardians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** No, I agree.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** That's true.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** You're like the raccoon for sure.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** I am Rolo.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:03]** You guys are literally dead center of the room.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:12]** If you put a five-foot square dead center of the room, you guys are on the one square up, one square over, one square down, and one square left of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:19]** If this thing phases through the center square and we all shoot each other... She comes up through the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** It'll be flanked, though.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** That'd be stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** It is the drift dead's turn.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** And they shoot through the room.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** What?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** What?

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** So they, I mean, like, you see them just... They went through the room?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** They come through one wall, and you see them pass through the other wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Okay.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:51]** And then... Do I get an... Because I readied an action to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, I feel like... Oh, dang, you do!

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** I didn't do... Okay, so... Wow, so we all do.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Who readied actions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Rolu.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** Rolu, yeah, Treme, and... I couldn't remember.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** So Rolu first.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** All right.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** It was a full attack, so it's two.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** The question, though, is he going to attack it where it stands now?

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Because that would give it cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:24]** But if it's going through the room, I would argue... No, I'd say there's no cover because those things on the ground are down.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** Also, this creature is flying at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Understood.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** That's creepy as hell.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** So just great.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Yeah.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** All right, that's an 18 against EAC.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Nice.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** For the first one, for the first attack.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** That's a hit.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** That's a hit.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Go ahead and roll your damage.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:46]** Seven points of, sorry, ten points of fire damage for the first attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Okay.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Roll your second attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** 17 EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** Yes, it hits again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** 17 against EAC.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** I feel like Rolu is just getting more and more pissed.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** The same feeling that he felt when he kicked over Bomb Gozzle.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** He's seen Chak go down.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** He's seen Torme go down.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** He has almost gone down.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** He is like, yo, this ends now.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** See you in hell.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** That's nine points of fire damage.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** So 19 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** Okay.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:22]** I did forget you do have soft cover because of Tremé being in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:30]** That's my argument, though, is he does not have soft cover because this incorporeal creature passed through the room.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:35]** So at any point, he could have fired his action without cover.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:41]** However, how could he possibly see this creature through me at this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** Because you don't take up the entire five foot square.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** So he would have seen.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** At what height is it flying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** It does.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** It hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** Cool.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** And so Treme is standing in your way.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** But you have that gun ready.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:01]** And as soon as you hear that weird noise come across the room, you pull that gun up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** What's the noise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Pull the trigger.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** That's the noise of it phasing through the wall.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Okay.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** And then you pull that trigger.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** And that first one hits.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** And the second one, it just obliterates it.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Again, like a gust of wind.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:24]** Like dust on the wind blows it against the wall and just poof into nothingness.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** And that thing is gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Nice and awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Ghostbusters!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:37]** You know, I was thinking he kind of looks like William Dafoe, while the other one looked like V. Goldberg.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** William Dafoe has Ryuk.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** It was a little William Dafoe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** I don't know if I agree with either one of those.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:46]** I'm trying to paint a picture for us.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** It was so cinematic.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:55]** All of you back to back, and then ready, and then that thing comes through, and Roller just lifts his gun and shoots right as it's flying across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:59]** We were literally all facing almost different sides of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:03]** And I was really hoping I forgot you had it ready in action.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** I was just trying to freak you out and be like, oh, fly through the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** It was freaky, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:09]** Where is it going to come out next?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** Cool.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Well, you're out of combat.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** What are you doing now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Yeah, for real.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** That's the only reason we're really here at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** You're going to play the loot?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** All right.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** So you guys are going to just check the whole room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:37]** All right, so you thoroughly examine the reading room, and then you go back into those two small rooms, and you kind of dig through the cubbies and everything, and you check those decaying bodies.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:48]** And on the body of the Lushunta, you find a small plastic carrying case, about two inches on each side, that survived over the centuries.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Plastics, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:56]** Though this wallet-like plastic item crumbles just a little bit.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Its contents remain fairly intact.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** And you are able to pull out a card.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Sorry, a cred stick.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** An ancient cred stick.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** You're not even sure if you know how to use this thing.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** But that thing has 2,000 credits on it.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** That's cool.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** And you also pull out a security badge.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** Good.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** That reads, Dr. Novu Swinney.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:40]** oh science officer whoa guys and there's a if you turn it over it's like a cat card there's a or a credit card that has a chip it has a little microchip on it oh boy look go ahead give me what did you find well uh good news and bad news bad news i think we found dr sweaty


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:50]** The one who was asking Dr. Vareate to adhere to protocols for file management.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** Great computer hygiene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** Really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Is that the good news or the bad news?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:01]** Which one was that, Jack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** It was kind of both.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** The good news is we found her.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** The bad news is this is her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:11]** Is that a security badge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** I don't know.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** So on the second corpse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:19]** Perhaps it might give us access to something deep inside this craft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Always the wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** On the second corpse, you find another security badge.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** This one reads, Bolvero Quim, Research Technician 2.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Somebody give me an engineering or computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Well, we'll do an engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** I can do computers.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** I mean, it doesn't matter.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** I got computers.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** 18.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** 24 for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Right.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:51]** So you guys kind of collectively know this microchip is, in fact, some kind of electronic key.

**[00:33:52 - 00:34:04]** You also recognize that it possibly has some kind of RFI or some kind of indication, like a friend or foe indication for the security systems.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** Like a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:21]** pretty much everybody in the lab here so this is this is a lab and everybody in the lab wore one of these security badges and that prevented the security systems from attacking yeah that person oh so this this will be good yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Okay.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Cool.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Everyone stay close together then.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** I think... Finders keepers, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** Should we, uh... I think... Should we hole up here to rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:36]** Seems like a good place as any, um... A bit beat.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Indeed.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Absolutely.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Metaphorically and physically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** All right.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** Then let's take a... Let's take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:49]** This is a strange... This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** I just felt like it had to be said.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Thanks, Yule.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** Yep.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Thanks, Yule.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Thank you.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Cool.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Long rest.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** We'll take turns watching, I guess.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** Yeah.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Is that cool with you, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** I mean, you do what you're going to do, and I'll adjust accordingly.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Let's do it.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** Yeah, we need to do it.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** In no way is it.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Cool.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Okay, so who's taking first watch?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I'll take first watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Jack will take two.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Will will take the last watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:23]** You guys are just staying in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Nobody else is doing anything?

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** You guys are just relaxing, resting, and trying to charge back up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:33]** Probably still be in the same position, just back to back.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** Trying to cover all of our options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:59]** yeah stay close i think so during termay's turn wait wait sorry just since i have the first turn i just want to add i'm rebuilding my breakaway ages during this time that's all okay nice that's fair i think uh i think as rolu is falling asleep then in his mind he just hears this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** And he startles awake, probably, sorry, sorry, for eight weeks.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Whoever he's leaning with or near up.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** And that happens once or twice.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** And then he finally is able to settle into... What were you saying, Kev, during my turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:19]** Oh, I was going to let... Are you... He hears a pew, and then he falls asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, but that's what he hears and he looks around and everyone else is sleeping.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** So he just falls asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Curious.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** It's probably something sus, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Yeah.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** But whatever.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:36]** Jack is haunted by visions of the Lushinta turning from beauty to...

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:50]** whatever I call this drifted to terrifying and is like start startled awake by the vision of her slashing him to pieces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** So you're, you're sleeping.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** Like all of you are asleep during Tremaine's turn and Tremaine is awake.

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:04]** But like you said, you're startled awake by the visions of this thing, this Lashinta ghost creature.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** And as you wake up,

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** you see her walk out of the room.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:16]** What, the ghost or the figure?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** She's not the violent creature you were fighting.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** She's back in her foolish form, but she's definitely transparent.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** And she actually walks slowly across the room.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:31]** She's glancing kind of at the tables, left and right.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** And every once in a while, you see her kind of reach down and tap or point at something.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** You're not quite sure what she's doing.

**[00:37:38 - 00:38:02]** and she passes right through termay as if he's not even there and i'm just silent through all this what am i so like are we all awake what are you doing uh so only people awake right now are chalk slightly slightly awake because he was startled awake and then termay is standing on guard yeah so termay what are you doing i am so is she like armed and she's not like being menacing or anything like that

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Not missing at all.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** She's just a Lashunta in a lab coat.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** And her lab coat's no longer torn.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** It's back to being... And Chalk's awake?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:14]** Chalk sees it, but he's dazed, right?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** He's like in a partial wake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** Chalk, are you seeing this?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Are you?

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** What is this?

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Am I dreaming?

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** You there, spirit.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** And she gets to that door.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** She pauses for a second.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** And then she steps through.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Does she open the door?

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Through the door.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** The door is shut.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** I'm assuming you guys shut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** So did she pause and look back when I talked to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** She paused.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** And you notice that she kind of wiggles her badge a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:03]** And then the door, as if she's waiting for the doors to open.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** And then she passes through them, and she's gone.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Should we follow her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:21]** I mean, it didn't end very well last time, but... I think it might be useful, but I don't want to wake everyone unnecessarily.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** I feel like rest is important.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** Yes.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Should we go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** I don't know.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** Will you come with?

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** I'm torn here.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:41]** And this is where like the rubber meets the road for role playing because mechanically check needs to rest.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:49]** But check as a as an individual would absolutely chase this ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** Well, I think it sounds like you're going to leave it up to a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** I think we should chase her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:11]** So Tamei's going to run to the end of the hallway and wave that badge.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Yep.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Just as she did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:17]** Jackie's going to climb up on his shoulder and they'll just ride together.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:22]** As you go to wave the badge, nothing happens.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:27]** And you realize that's because you had to mechanically open this door.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:31]** Like it no longer operates automatically because you guys had to force your way in.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** You had to force it shut.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:41]** So you wave the badge and nothing happens and you reach your hands through, slide it open and you step through and you look both ways.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** You don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:48]** Is there any indicator of which direction she went?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** I'm going to say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Okay.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:54]** I'm just going to go to the end of this hallway towards the large green door.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** Do I hear anything, see anything?

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Anything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:05]** So you left the reading room and you're back in that center corridor where there's two doors.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Yeah.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:11]** And then north of you is the big double doors where you saw the dark cloud recede.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Chalk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:33]** Okay, so there's no indication of the Lashenta, but you do hear a thrumming.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:39]** Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:48]** Given that it is a low frequency noise and not a high frequency noise, I would have a better indication of what direction it is coming from, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:50 - 00:42:15]** okay john is that true i actually think high frequency noise is more directional frequency no i i don't know either way but yes you know that's coming harder to localize low frequency noise but it depends on how low it depends on how low but high frequency is also very hard it's also a lot like you you hear it but you also feel it through the floor okay and you recognize that it's coming through those double doors like yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:23]** Localization is not the easiest, but if it's just laterally around us, in front of you and 180, maybe 270 a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:31]** I would point to a study where they did experiments on backup chirps on vehicles.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** And they determine that lower frequency.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** That sounds like a great argument for later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Yeah, that sounds great.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:43]** I would need to know all about the attenuation of the high frequency noise, which happens a lot quicker than low frequency.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Nerds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Yeah, what are you guys doing?

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** What is the plan here?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** Let's keep going.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** I think we lost her.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Let's go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** And Chuck kind of curls up and falls asleep on your shoulder.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** He just says it and then topples over.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:23]** to me it's gonna return back daddy's just has this dream we see this is what i feel like to me and shack are doing something stupid like just like kind of mumbles in his sleep you wake up in a panic you realize they're no longer in the room but like thaddeus being thaddeus just curls up in a ball tighter all right you guys going back to the room yeah

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** So you head back into the room.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** You finish up your watch.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** Rolu, you take over.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** The rest of them are sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:39]** I think one of Rolu's hands slips into one of the hidden compartments.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:44]** And he just reminds himself of what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Remind us what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** And then two of his other hands just start reviewing.

**[00:43:52 - 00:44:16]** the stars that he's been drawing and every once in a while there's a pause slight correction notation footnote just thinking and that's the majority of his time there is a moment where he looks over at chalk and he he just wants to see how well chalk is sleeping


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:27]** He's cuddled up, curled up with Termay as if like Termay like very carefully sat down in like a meditation form and Chak is just on his shoulders still sound asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** Yeah, he's worried about Chuck a little bit.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:50]** He both recognizes that Chuck is incredibly capable, but also he wants to... Chuck will frequently put themselves in a position that could be dangerous, and maybe he's wondering a little bit about how well Chuck is able to endure the shock of what happened.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** All right, so your watch kind of ends.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** You see everybody's well enough rested.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** You wake them up.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** What are you guys doing?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** What's next?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** What's your plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Good morning.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:10]** I think Rolu, seeing Shock, says, Shocker, that was quite an experience.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:29]** That you had with these drift data I have had some limited experience with the undead guys I Have some chalk and I we we saw the woman We saw another ghost


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:34]** She was passing through this room, but she was no threat, it seemed.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** But she... She headed out into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** And then we lost her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Did you follow her?

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Of course we followed her.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Who do you think we are?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** That was foolish.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:47]** It was dumb, but I expected as much.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** It was foolish.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** But she lost you, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:58]** Yes, and I think... I heard... I don't need to describe it as a...

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:04]** A localization of some low frequency noise stimuli.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Ah, yeah, it's low frequency.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:11]** Reminiscent of a 1970s Thurlow and Meringer study.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Yeah, it's harder to localize, right?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** That was quite easy, actually.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:24]** I had better acuity, but beside the point, it was those two double doors at the end of the north side of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** That's where we're ultimately headed anyway.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** Shall we go and hit everything up along the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Let's go so we can get off this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** Let's hope we don't run into any more zombies.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** Sorry, any more what?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Zombles.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:43]** It's like, you know, like slang for zombies.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** I've never heard that slang before.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** Look, I don't expect you to know things like this.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** Like walkers or... Yeah.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** The undead.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** The undead, but incorporeal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** I don't really care what you call them.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** I don't ever want to see one again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:05]** I have a sneaky suspicion we're probably going to see more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** We might.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Shaq, can I just talk to you for a moment, Shaq?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** What's up?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Roluv for sure is going to watch them.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Sorry, Roluv is going to watch myself?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Sorry.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** Thaddeus and Roluv always get each other confused, ironically.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Thaddeus is going to watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** Shaq, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Uh, no.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** Then let me rephrase this.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** I'm not often most gifted with language.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** How are you holding up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** About as well as any Raxalite.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:50]** We just faced some, like, drift demons that almost killed all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** And now we're trapped on a spaceship with God knows how many more.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** I'm ready to get off this rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** I agree with you.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:02]** I have to say, I have to admire your optimism.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:10]** I think you need to focus on a fortunate and successful future.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** It's something I learned a great many years ago.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Oh, my God.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:20]** That the more that you manifest what will happen, then it will happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** Sure, Cobb.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Let's get going, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** All right.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Good talk.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Good talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** What were you guys talking about over there?

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Believe me, we don't want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** I just, I'm sorry.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Did you overhear us?

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** No, no, not at all.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** You sure?

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** I was just sharing a bit of wisdom that I was fortunate to be a part of some years ago.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:54]** Yes, which just tells you that when you picture the positive outcome, whatever it is that you desire, it's more likely to manifest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** I'm sorry.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** Look, I had a nice long night of sleep, but I'm still too tired for this bull****.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** So can we please just move on?

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** I don't want to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:06]** Check rolls his eyes, obviously, at the bickering and walks toward the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:11]** Perhaps I shall envision... Keep it together, guys.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** Save your sage wisdom for another day.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:19]** Let's just stay in the moment and get out of this situation alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:27]** Thaddeus left that room along with Shaq as Rolly's voice trailed away into the background.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Rolly didn't finish what he was saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Thaddeus...

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** You guys are heading, you headed out of that room and now you're heading north towards those double doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** It was those doors up ahead, guys.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Well, I heard that thrumming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** I don't know how else to describe it.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** Can you imagine and manifest what's on the other side of this door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** You seem well-rested enough, Thaddeus.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Why don't you go ahead and take the lead here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** We don't know what's on the other side.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:55]** We may want to activate our environmental predictions just to be safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** That's a good role-playing chip.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Yeah.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** All right.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** We don't know what we're going to face in there.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Thaddeus activates it.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** And he will open the door this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Oh, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** So the door opens up, and you're struck by... No, I'm kidding.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:21]** So the doors open up, and you see there's a small room, and the decor of this room is starkly different from the rest of Stellar Flare's interior.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:27]** The walls and the ceiling were once white, though now they're covered and stained with grime.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:35]** A hardened substance that might once have been rubber carpets are on the floor.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:42]** A set of glass-fronted plastic lockers along the western wall contain shapeless coveralls hanging from hooks.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:47]** There is a small slot in the wall right next to the door to the north.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Door to the north!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** Is this like a clean room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Sorry.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** Every time I hear the door, I'm like... It's so random, but good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** Is this like a bunny suit room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Ah, good call, yes.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:00]** I'm...

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** You're right.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:05]** It is like it was some kind of clean room of ancient times.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** 300 years.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Yeah, good job.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Good call.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:33]** didn't even need the percept wait so it's just this little room there's there's nothing else beyond it well it means that there's something beyond some sort of uh facility perhaps factory or some maybe perhaps the uh drive system for this sensitive equipment i don't know but i'm gonna bet that that's it seems like that's the research facility that all these scientists were working in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Let's explore the room.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Exactly.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** On our way there.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Let's check this area real quick.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** We should maybe grab a suit or two.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** If they fit.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:52]** Something I forgot to note is as those doors slid open, that thump, thump, thump noise kind of escalated just a little bit.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** It's as if those doors were blocking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** The noise from the room beyond.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:03]** That you heard, the one that you heard earlier when you guys went out into the halls.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** Okay, so the doors are open.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:09]** You guys, everybody stepped inside except, I can't, I lost Thaddeus.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** Thaddeus and Jermaine are standing on top of each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Rolu's not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Rolu's still standing outside the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Yeah, that was me taking notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Oh, okay.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Notes are good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** I tend to be the only one.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** I don't know what happens.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It's all right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** So you guys step forward.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:29]** You do notice that the door in the front is locked.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** The door to the north.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** And you are able to read.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:41]** In common, it says laboratory on the little plaque.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** What do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Is there anything in this room that we should check out?

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Perception rolling now.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** Is there something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Do you want to roll a perception?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Yes.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Okay.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** 24.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Nice.

**[00:52:53 - 00:53:01]** You notice at the bottom of one of those lockers, they're glass front lockers and they have the suits are hanging up.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** But at the bottom, there's almost like a cubby.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** And in that cubby, there's an advanced med kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Ooh.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Grab.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** That's key.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** And again, you also make note that there is a slot in the wall on the north side.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** What's the slot for?

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Slot in the wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** I think it's for dirty suits.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Hey, Shaq, can you crawl in that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Do you want to do an engineering check on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** Oh.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Yeah, is it wide enough for Shaq to crawl through?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** I'll assist.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** He's tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Shaq, just hold on one second.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Let me just take a closer look.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** That's fine.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** I'm just a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Just looking.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:49]** I would say the slot is definitely not big enough for Chalk to go through unless you use cheat code sage abilities where you're able to turn into a cloud.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** Got it.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Never going to let that down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** No.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** You'll find that cheat code in the other cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:02]** Describe what a sage drone looks like based on the core rule.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:09]** I believe it said it's a tiny creature, not a... Well, I rolled a natural 20, so yeah, I ate it, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** It's a 17 gift to determine its use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** All right.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** You don't recognize the purpose of the slot.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Okay.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** But you do realize that it is small.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** That it's slender and long.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:34]** And I think one of you is carrying that security badge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Oh, okay.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Got it.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Right.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** This ship is over 300 years old.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** They just didn't have the technology that you guys are used to.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** The doors open automatically for you.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** You actually have to swipe your card or insert it into a hole.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Archaic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** They don't have tap to pay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Right.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:57]** You recognize this is a card reader.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Well, do you want to say something?

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** I just wanted to check.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** Is everyone up on their hit points?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:07]** I realize I am a bit low in that department, but I do have two.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** I mean, I could use some.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Serums of healings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** I'm all right.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Yeah.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** I'm just going to hit myself with one of mine.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** I have a. All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Yeah, I could.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I could use one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** You don't have one, John?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:20]** Nope.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** I'll give you one of these if you don't.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** All right.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** So I am now out of serums of healing.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Just noting.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** That sucks, man.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** I got one.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** Cool.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Thank you, Thaddeus, for that opinion.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Stabs himself with it.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** Do you want to roll it?

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Sure.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** I imagine he hands it to you.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** It's what?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** 2d4 plus 2?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** No, it's 1d8.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:47]** Thaddeus, like, pulls out a serum and then just, like, looks Rolude dead in the eyes and gives it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:51]** Sorry, so you're giving me one of yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** Yeah.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yeah, take it, Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Roller's quiet.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** You can see the suspicion.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** And then he puts it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** That is dipped the healing serum needle.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Or he swapped it with one of his venom caster.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Cool.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** So you guys are all healed up, you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Mostly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** Mostly, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** What are you going to do now?

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** Can I don one of these clean suits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:32]** I'll say that you probably know that the clean suit won't do anything more than your environmental protections, which you said you all put on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Yes.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Shut up.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** So you pull it out of the locker and you realize it's just... Take a look at it.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** Yeah.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** It's definitely like a clean room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Yeah.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** That stuff's not going to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** If you've ever worn one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** I've worn quite a few.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** All right.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Are we ready?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** Here we go.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** I think so.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** Open Sesame.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** And Treme takes the key card that he's got from earlier.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** Oh.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Swipes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** He swipes it.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:09]** And as that door starts to open... Oh, God.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:13]** Vari 13, Kesh, and Merc.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:18]** along with the goblins and some of Keshi's are excitingly waiting outside the stellar flare.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:25]** Merc and Keshi are connected to a panel near the front door and they're working on some kind of electronic device.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** A couple of the goblins are helping voice device.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Sorry.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** I went into my, my Merc voice for a second.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:37]** A couple of goblins are quote unquote helping, um,

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** But Vari 13 is pacing nervously and excitedly back and forth.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:47]** They decide that they're going to send a message off to Riddle about the progress that you guys have made.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:54]** But while focused on that comm device, they start to kind of stray a little bit further from the others.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:02]** And when they get to the edge of the wreckage, they look up and they find a mob of true warriors.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Tez Tronin is right in front.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Hello there.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:28]** Vahri 13 turns and runs but trips and as she falls her head strikes a rock no Kevin and when Vahri gets back up they find themselves scrambling to one of the last two escape pods they bury the box under the seat and then step out and hit the eject button

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:31]** The green light over the door starts to turn a flash of yellow.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Vari turns and runs for the last escape pod.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:40]** As they step inside, they feel a small but strong hand wrap around their arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Give it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** Vari hears that in their head, but they don't look back.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:52]** They struggle to climb further into the escape pod against the pulls of that creature.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:57]** Vari manages to kick the initiate button as they feel the creature strike them.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** Their vision fades, but they can hear in their mind, It's not here!

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Where did it go?

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:10]** Vari pries her eyes open to see the figure vanishing through the escape pod door.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:16]** And through that, the hatched viewpoint, she can see the flashing yellow.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:20]** And then a burst of light shines through the viewing port.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:26]** Varya's weak, but they struggle to get into the seat and buckle in as the escape pod flashes out of the side of the ship.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:40]** And she watches as the stellar flare shrinks in the distance before it explodes into a yellow-red fireball with flashes of purple and blue and bolts of green energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:40 - 01:00:05]** vari's last memory is one of those bolts striking their escape pod and that's our game oh kev what just happened what just happened kev with the hair to drop well like the question that i have that i hope everyone has if the stellar flare blew up into pieces what are we on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** Yes!

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** That's what I wanted to know.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** Is this a ghost ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** So, for next time, I'm going to lose my shit.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Wow.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** This ghost ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** It's perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:26]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
