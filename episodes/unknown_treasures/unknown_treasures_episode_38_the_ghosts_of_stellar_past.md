**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:59]** Welcome back to We'll Save In, the interstellar tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:59 - 00:00:59]** I am Kevin.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:05]** I also just want to say welcome back to Vinny.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Well, not Vinny.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** Sorry.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** Welcome back to Kelly.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Not Vinny.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** I had this in my head.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** I was like, oh, yeah.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:13]** And then I saw your face.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** You know what?

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:14]** Kind of.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** We did go somewhere.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:19]** No, I was going to say, don't walk away.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:22]** I was going to say, I got to meet Vinny in person for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** That's right.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** Yes, the first inaugural meeting.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** You made yourself look artificially short of those pictures, by the way, Kevin.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:29]** There's no way.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** You must have done it.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** No, I'm actually that short compared to him.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** He's a giant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** He's like 7'8".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** He is a giant.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** I agree that Vinny is a giant.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** I know he's big, but like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:44]** I'm actually pretty upset that I'm the shortest person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** You looked like a Joey in a kangaroo pouch.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** He wouldn't let it go.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** By the way, Will was in Australia.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** That's what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Welcome back, Kelly.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Welcome back, Will.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** That's kind of where I want to take this.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Tell us about your trips.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** I want to talk about your trips.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** I want you to tell me where did you go?

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** What was the best part of your trips?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** John, you're going to have to make something up.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:31]** well i think you didn't even ask me that's right john and i just got back from a trip yeah yeah dude well that's right there we go no no everybody traveling everywhere no that's fine yeah you didn't want to welcome me back you don't care about my trip it's hard to keep tabs on all this it's fine i even i traveled because i i flew down to florida and and yeah i looked at some rockets and then i got to talk to vinny and in person we watched usc lose way back when sad

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Okay.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** So, John, tell us about your trip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** No, it's much more exciting to hear about Kelly and Will.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Take it away, Kelly and Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:44 - 00:03:09]** uh kelly all right uh i was in japan and korea uh for like almost a month um it was pretty cool in japan i was just hanging out with people that i've been in japan a lot so i'm just hanging out with people i already knew then i went to snowy bumble f**k nowhere which apparently had like a lot of like really good internet i don't know how like i was basically in a bar that's where we recorded our last episode

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Yeah.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:15]** And then like the major city I was in in Japan before that did not have good internet, at least my particular place.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** And then I went to Korea and I just clubbed like every night.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** I haven't clubbed in a while.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:25]** So it was just like going to like clubs over and over and over and over again.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]** I don't even, it's so crazy.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** It was just a blur.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:40]** It was a blur, but I felt like it was in a K-drama because I was under this tower called Namsan Tower, and that's where we had our Airbnb, and it was really fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Met some cool people.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** It was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** I had a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Is there a rom-com that they're going to make out of this one?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:49]** Are you going to appear on Korean television at some point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:54]** I thought what I am going to do is try to become an actor in a Korean drama.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:59]** Actually, one of my aspirations has always been to be in a K-drama.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** I feel like that would be really fun.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** You should make that happen.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Can you direct it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** If you're listening to this and you're a K-drama director,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:27]** Yeah, but the thing that Westerners are always really really done in like kdramas I want to be like the actual the first one that is actually good like it actually good character cuz usually they're like the worst Typically, I know they're just no not even they're just they're just because that's that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Yeah, they're done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** They're always done It's kind of like watch

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Oh, God, yeah, I know, right?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:42]** I guess, like, how people feel misrepresented in, like, American films, like, that are, like, non-white characters a lot of the time.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Sure.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** I can understand a little bit what that might be like.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** I've seen so many K-dramas, people.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** Got it.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** Anyway, we'll get Sarah in the K-drama.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** It'll be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** If you've made it this far in our catalog, Sarah, what's up?

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Anyway, how's it going, Will?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** How was Australia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** It was my first time going to Australia.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:19]** I met up with some family members, in-laws, and it's a beautiful country of many diverse cultures as well as diverse wildlife, which is what I'm into.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** I went to Tasmania.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** I went to Adelaide.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** I went to Sydney.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:54]** i got like tasmania is like a whole new world it's like crazy it's it's a mind-boggling uh experience i suggest everyone should go and driving on the left side of the road is not hard at all um because the right side of the car is like basically like as long as you're in the center of the road you feel comfortable as a driver in my opinion maybe it's because i ride motorcycles i don't know um

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:59]** And the other thing I'll say is I'm really into cricket now.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:06]** So I'm looking up cricket leagues in LA.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:12]** So if you do cricket or you are a fan of cricket, hit me up on the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:16]** Can you very quickly in two minutes explain the rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** No, because they're made up.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** They don't make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** That's why it's fun.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Made up and the points don't matter.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:40]** My favorite thing about Australia when I went down there was we got there and the first day we turned on the news and there was a gang fight at the local mall and they call biker gangs bikies.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** There was a shootout with the bikies earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Yeah.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** Okay.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** So in Australia, they like have fun, fun little words.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:54]** I feel like they shortened, like instead of like fruit chocolate, it'll be like fruit chocos.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:00]** It's, it's always like a shorter form of whatever you would expect it to be.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** And then Australianized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** So if you want chocolate covered fruit from Adelaide,

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Go get some fruit chocos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:17]** This must be why they're â€“ just Tasmania and Australia is so awesome is because they've saved a lot of time in their day-to-day language.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** They're very efficient.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** They have more time to do more things.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Which is mostly true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** You know why else they're awesome?

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** Because that's the other thing I learned about Australia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Mostly true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:37]** So while you two were traveling the world and jet setting, John and Vinny, you guys met up together and went where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** I'll let you take that, Vinny.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:43]** Vinny is putting a fork in his wine glass, which is really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** There's a bug in my wine.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** I'm trying to get it out.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** But it's like, holy shit, it's still alive?


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** You should eat it.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** I mean, it's dying now, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Are you going to keep drinking that wine?

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** So for the listener, we went to get Vinny's attention.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** He's got his fork buried in his wine glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:12]** I'm really surprised he had a fork and is drinking wine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:35]** yeah it's probably picking up his cheese with it right no i was trying to like find i was about to take a sip i saw a fly in my wine was like i'm just gonna fish that out real quick um so john and i took a trip uh uh john and i actually met up at atl at the airport um what is that had a mimosa had a nice adult beverage to start the morning

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:42]** I am very excited to spend it more with Vinny and with Will.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** As I understand, Will is also a frequent fan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** He started in his home.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:42]** He apparently knows a lot of the brewers and would like figured out there was a local brewery and a local beer that he really liked.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:46]** He was like, hey man, next time you brew a batch, can I get like a gallon of your wort?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:54]** And so he took the wort and distilled it down and aged it with like a charred oak cube to do a taste test.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** And the rest is just me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** I'm going to need you guys to get more information on this and drop it on our social medias.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** So anybody in that area can go check it out.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** It was awesome.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** The best gin I think I've ever had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Oh, I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Australia's got some awesome gin.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** I loved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** We have to compare notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** I don't think we've ever had a good gin.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I would love to try one that's actually good.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** That's how I felt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** We'll do this.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** We'll do the Pepsi challenge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** That's how I felt, Kelly.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** But before this.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** And then I had them.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Oh, yeah?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** Yeah.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** What the hell?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** That's awesome.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Let's have a tasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** All right.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** We've made Kev wait long enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** I have one last travel story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Is it about the Navy, Kevin?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** This is real.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Is this about the Navy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** It's not about Navy at all, man.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** Is it your Navy friend?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** No, it's actually my current co-worker.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:09]** He is leaving tomorrow to go to Thailand for like a full month.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:13]** He is going to train Muay Thai.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** He's like traveling there and living in a gym to train Muay Thai and to become a super warrior.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** So I just think it's really cool.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** He's going to learn to fight.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** I mean, he already knows how to fight, but he's going to learn to fight better.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** And speaking of fighting better...

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Let's get back to the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** There it is.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** I was waiting for it the whole time.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** What a transition.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Wow.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** That was gold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** Let's play.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** All right.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** That was a fun conversation, but it is time to play the game.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** That's the reason we're here.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:51]** Let me tell you, last time, a patrol security bot that looked like a metal crustacean engaged a security threat.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** You guys.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:57]** It started off by attacking Treme, but Treme dropped some hazards and ran for cover.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** The robot then turned its assault on the rest of you down the hall.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:07]** As it made its way closer, you each took some pretty big hits on it, but it was able to make a quick repair using its nanites.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:14]** Then Treme almost took it out, but the crit card stole the kill from him.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:25]** And it was able to put one more round at you guys, giving you a jolting arc and hitting the three of you, Thaddeus, Chak, and Rolu, with electricity before being taken out by Thaddeus.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** And Thaddeus said, I recorded that one for you, Rolu.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** Yes.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** So let's take you back to this map.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I forgot about that.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** This dead crustacean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Dead crustacean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Always tying it to the Navy and the sea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** There's nothing about the Navy.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** No, there's 12 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** Hold on, let me erase the board.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:58]** We haven't talked about the Navy for zero minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Let's just lay it out for the listeners.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** They are inside the Stellar Flare.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** They just came in the doors.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** They roamed around a little bit.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** They are back at that front door where the turret came down.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** And that's kind of where the battle with the crustacean took place.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:20]** So they're in that first set of corridors that goes, there's one that goes straight north, and then there's one that goes east, and one that goes west.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:27]** And we have Thaddeus, Chalk, and Rolu all clustered on the left side of the map.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:36]** And then we have Torme is across that barrier on the other side of the map, about 80 feet apart from each other.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** And they can't even see each other because they have limited vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** I think I hear you guys down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** I can hear you.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** Oh, there he is.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Polo.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I see him walking in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Watch out.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:53]** Don't trip over this creature.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Let's hurt yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** I'm going to examine it.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** It's fine.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** I did a good number on it.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** You're probably all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Is there anything on it?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Any information on it that I can examine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Oh, you know nothing.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** You're like, I'm not even sure this is metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:18]** Is this even... This is definitely some... This is seafood, right?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** This crustacean-looking thing?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Can we eat it?

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** You think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** Termay can't.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** Termay is not that dumb.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Redo that.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** That's sticky.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** No.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Termay's a smart guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:37]** I think Termay's, like, tired, and he's just really exhausted, and he's just like, I don't know what this thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Let me come over.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** Termay has finally lost it, too.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** Rolly's been losing it recently, hasn't he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:52]** Let me see what I can see, if there's any manufacturer or any sort of common architecture to this creature.

**[00:15:52 - 00:16:02]** And I want to do an engineering check on it to see if I can figure out, like I said, manufacturer or maybe I know the type that is 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** Yeah, you search over it.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** You actually don't find any kind of sign of manufacturing.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** You kind of can put together that this thing is old.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:17]** It's probably around 300 years old, if not older.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Is that consistent with the age of the Stellar Flare?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** Yeah.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** Okay.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Yeah.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Good putting that together, Vinny.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** That was real smart thinking there.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** I will say that you guys can loot this thing, kind of.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** The robot does have a tactical arc emitter.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** But before you look that up, it is actually integrated into the body, so you can't remove it.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:48]** However, you do find two batteries that have 20 charges each that you're able to disconnect from the carapace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:58]** This may be 300 years old, you say, but man, I could really use this battery that seems to fit on my blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** It's a smart move.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** We are in the desert, and as we've seen, resources can be scarce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Thank Triune for universal charging standards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Is it USB-C?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** It's USB-B, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** I do have one of those adapters.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** I got one, I think, somewhere in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:23]** So there actually is a very large plug-type section that somehow this thing has been able to recharge.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Somehow, is all I'm going to say.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** You didn't score high enough to get any more information on that.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** What do you guys want to do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** I think we should go into that room where that creepy thing went earlier.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** Up the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Sure.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** That's probably best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** We actually didn't see where it ended up.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** It just disappeared around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** I thought we saw it ended up generally up there.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:47]** There was a shadow coming from the light from one of the rooms or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Yeah, Rulu.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:53]** Is there a complimentary hallway on the other side of this one here?

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Perhaps it would be good to get a lay of the land.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Yeah, I was there earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:05]** And Terme walks, he turns around from the thing and walks down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Rulu will follow behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:12]** So just so you guys know, you are passing a bunch of doors down this hallway.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** We talked about that, right?

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** I don't know if you can see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Yeah, but we went down the center hallway, I thought.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** We did.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:20]** On the corridor that you're currently walking in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** There's some doors here.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** You guys, wait up.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** I'm not saying you have to go in them, but there are doors available to open if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Let's take the systematic approach.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** Since we're here, we'll just zigzag our way up and make sure we explore every inch of this floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:42]** Yeah, if you want to wander hallways, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** What are we doing in here again?

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** We're getting... We're just exploring generally.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** Why don't we get this first room knocked off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Why is that one the first room?

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** We are... Tremei and I are standing in front of a door right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** This could be... What do you think that is?

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Should we just go in?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Is that... Okay, I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:24]** rolu i'm not not no offense man i i just i want to be with the rest of the guys you know that's fine don't be alone with rolu in a dark corner come on like we've all learned more protected than you would from check whispers under his breath that might be hazardous for your health indeed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** We are already opening this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:31]** We know when this popsicle will open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Yep, let's open it up.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** Wait, you should check for some traps, I think would be good.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** All right, Rolloo, I have an idea.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Why don't you go first?

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** More than happy to.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** They are now on the left side of this map.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:50]** I've coerced them to open a door, which is awesome, because I put a lot of work in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:54]** He's like, I put a lot of work into this combat that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** Walk through and bypass everything I did.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** I know how John feels now.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** There's a ping of radiation.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:04]** Who knows?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Please open this door.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Hey, you said something deadly.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** You should definitely open this door.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** You rolled a 10 on perception.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** Understanding what that reference is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:19]** I'd like to see if I can figure out, is there any noise coming from this door?

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Do we sense any movement, vibration?

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** Anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Did you roll a perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** 19.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Let's see here.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** 19 also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** It's suddenly dark over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:42]** So you don't sense anything.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:46]** And then you slide open the door.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:59]** And as you walk in, you see that there are several square steel tables with attached stools that fill this room.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:09]** A row of automated food dispensers takes up the eastern wall, though all of them have cracked fronts and appear to be non-functional.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** One has even toppled over.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:15]** The floor around it bears the lingering stain of some kind of liquid that's like long since evaporated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Grape Fanta?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Yes.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** It's a purplish bubble stains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** After you.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Sure.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** What kind of room is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:33]** It looks to be some sort of a kitchen or galley mess.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:38]** Maybe Rolo steps 10 feet into the center of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** And as you do... No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** Anybody want to give me your perception or engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** I'll do an engineering check.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:49]** And that's a natural 20 for 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:54]** I got a 15 on engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:57]** So you don't see much around the tables.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:03]** There are sometimes trays or glasses, stuff kind of thrown about.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:10]** But you do see that those food dispensers on the far side that...

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:20]** They might not be functional, but it's possible you could salvage them for bulk electronics and or junk, as we've been calling it.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** So just keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Hey, who got that junk blaster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** Probably to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:34]** I thought Thaddeus had the junk blaster.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** I only have these junk gems.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Let me search my four guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Yeah, I have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:49]** You may want to... Maybe you could salvage some of this wreckage over on the east wall for junk to shoot from your... To blast from your junk blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** Oh, does a junk blaster shoot junk?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** I didn't... Yeah, I think so.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Does it not shoot junk?

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Yeah, I think it shoots random junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** I thought it was made of junk.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** I thought it was just a piece of shit, and that's why they call it that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** I think it's made of junk.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:05]** Yeah, it has a junk property where if you shoot it and roll a natural one, it'll explode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** It's also a junk laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:11]** As the engineer here, I have to say, I don't know that you fire junk.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I think it is simply made of junk.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Well, I have a junk shot or junk shard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** We're playing Starfinder, not Fallout?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Where the f*** is it?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** There's a spell.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Where is it?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** There's a junk sword.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** I can't find junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:27]** If you didn't know, in Fallout, there's a gun that you can actually shoot whatever junk you have.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** So if you had a teddy bear or CDs or... It could also be good for the trash hunters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** I think we should move on.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** Well, I need to know, Kevin, is this a homebrewed weapon or is this an actual Starfinder thing because I can't find it online?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I presented it to you guys.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** I'm sorry.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:49]** I'm trying to look up the description specifically, the description, not just how it looks and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** There's the Mega Junk Laser that came off of... Oh, Junk Laser?

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:54]** It's not a Junk Blaster.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** Yes, it came off of Bomb Gozzle's mech suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** My bad.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** I called it a Junk Blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** Everyone called it a Junk Blaster because I feel like that's what you called it originally, though.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** It's Junk Laser.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** It's just laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:12]** It's crafted by Goblins, which means it might blow up at any second.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Okay, cool.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:43]** is there anything else you guys want to do in this room and which way do you want to exit there's another door to the north that you could go through but all four of you are now in the room yeah I didn't know where I was for a second Jack do you feel like there's nothing else in this room of significance you seem to have your eye with that 26 do I notice anything else

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** I'll say that your leaves kind of tingle.

**[00:24:49 - 00:25:01]** You're not... I guess you're not perceptive enough to understand that, but there's a sense of uneasiness about... I think... There's something weird about this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:05]** I think we should be done in here now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** That all the grapefant is missing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:11]** Oh, that is a bad sign.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:15]** Perhaps let's leave through the door we entered through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Jack steps out into the hallway.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Maybe Kevin will be there.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** That's the last one to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:33]** This is like Among Us, but Thaddeus just stepped out, and we're going to step back into a dead body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** Treme's there, just cut in half.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** That's right, we all knew who it would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:47]** Chuck, Thaddeus, and Treme stepped out, and Rolu goes to walk through the door, and just before you step out of that door...

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:53]** You get a cold chill, even through your environmental protections.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** By the way, who has their environmental protections on?

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** I do.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** I do, too.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Please do.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** I do.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** All right.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** I don't think we're going to go to that.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:09]** Make sure you're ticking off your hours because you only have so many hours available for that, right?

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** You have 24 charges.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** We've been in here for at least an hour now.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** I have 72.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** But Rolu, back to you.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** So don't we just get some batteries?

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:48]** sure if you want to connect those somehow i don't know if you can but um rolu you you don't have environment on so like on the back of your neck you you feel a cold chill but like you do feel it through your suit too um and you hear the faintest sound of a food tray sitting down at a table and just whispers of a conversation but like too low for you to understand what they're saying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:55]** I feel like Rolo can't see that well, so he thinks... Shrek, did you make it out?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Are you still in the room?

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** I'm out here, cop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Go ahead and roll me a perception.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Everyone?

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Or just the Rolo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Who's rolling?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Just the Rolo.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** So would you roll 17?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Nice.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:25]** So as you turn back, your eyes scan the room and like you, you have low, you don't have any low vision and it's low light in here, but for some reason you can see clearly that your eyes have just adjusted right to this room.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Sure.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** And you see nothing there and the whispers stop.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:39]** And then there's a crackle and a pop and an echoing through the corridors is a sound of static rustling and

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** And then you hear a familiar voice.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Did it work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** I don't know.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Maybe.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Let's try it.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Junk lords.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** I don't know what else to call them.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** We're working on the comms.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** I hope they can hear this.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** And then there's a click and silence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:10]** Is there a communications thing in the door here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Or in the kitchen.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Not where you're standing.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:17]** It's actually coming from like there's sets of speakers kind of throughout.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** You notice that it's in the roof and along the top of it.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Good coverage.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:23]** Yeah.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Yep.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** You guys know who that was, right?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:35]** That was clearly Merc and Kesh trying to get through to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:42]** Can I speak to them using my mind link?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:48]** I'm not sure what the limitations are, but they're not within eyesight, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** I don't think you have to be in eyesight.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** It's the same as the sharing ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** Yeah, which is 30 feet limited, right?

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Yes, it's 30 feet.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** All right, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** So definitely outside of 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:09]** I thought I heard for a second before they came over the comms.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:17]** I could have sworn I heard like it sounded like somebody was sitting down and having a conversation here in this mess hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:24]** Is there anything that I can telepathically communicate with in the other room?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** because that's within 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:34]** I'm not sure what the limitations are of your telepathic abilities, but I don't think you can just randomly communicate with anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** It's any creature within 30 feet with which you share a language.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Well, are they in this dimension?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** Yeah, is this like a ghost or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** Can I do a mysticism check?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Sure.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** Termay casts grave words on the room.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:53 - 00:30:01]** The soda machine pops up and says, Fanta, Fanta, don't you want a... Sorry, grape only.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:14]** I got a 16 and I am looking because I think I have something that has to do with...

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** Reducing the DCs.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** It is not for this.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Apologies.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** So 16 mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** All right.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:29]** So mysticism, I have to try to double check just to make sure as mysticism is more of like the understanding of the mystical arts.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:36]** In fields of magic religion, the plain spell casting, identify magic item spells and make magic items yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Yeah.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Right.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:43]** So it's not necessarily like you're not detecting anything.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Yeah, it's not detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** No, but it's the knowledge of phenomena.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Right.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:55]** And that cold chill, you actually step out of that room and there's a barrier of cold, essentially.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:04]** You do start to piece together from what you understand to be spirits of some kind, possibly.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Oh, man.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Something has happened to you.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Something.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Something.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** Is it paranormal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:18]** Do you all feel this cold barrier here at the threshold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:23]** I don't think I did, but I was also really tired, and I rolled a one earlier.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** Oh, we did through our suits, right, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Was it kind of tingly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:58]** only Rolu felt it maybe it was just your conscience eating away at you did you think that as you guys come back to that door and you know Chalk's the first one he's put his vines out and he kind of stretches them all out to almost make like a receptor of kinds you know he steps into the room and he spins around slowly he's just trying to feel out like making himself into some kind of like EMF detector like a water vein thing yeah and he's like no nothing here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** Typically when something... Divining rod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Divining rod, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:14]** Typically when something like this happens, it often means that there's some sort of intense memory or event that has sealed...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:22]** Well then, perhaps we should leave it sealed and move on to the next... Let's keep exploring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** That's a good idea.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Move on to the next what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:34]** Not further into the crypt of... I'm sure that kitchen's probably full of whores, maybe.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I don't know.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** horrors, not whores.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Sorry.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** I mean, maybe there's another section of the ship we should check out.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** For whores?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Ah, yeah.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Right.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** All right, let's move on to the other door.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Hopefully we won't find either of those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:57]** All right, so you guys are going to head back down the opposite direction to the corridor going towards the east.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:03]** You pass the intersection in the very beginning where the turret was, and you come up to a door.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:10]** Give me either an engineering check or a strength check to try to open this thing.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** I'll do an engineering check.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** 20.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** Sorry, 23.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:24]** And now you feel like a total fool because as you approach it, you get close enough to see it because you can't see very well in the dark.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:30]** You realize this door is damaged beyond all usefulness.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** What about this door over here?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** It's just crumpled and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** No, another one over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:40]** So Treme approaches the next door up the hallway.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** The same hallway.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** The same hallway, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** Same side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Same side of the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** Do we detect anything on the outside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:52]** From the outside?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Rolling perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** I got a 17.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** I got not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** 14, probably.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** My eyes are having trouble adjusting from walking.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:11]** Yeah, so you guys don't have a sense of dread in this area, but there is that coldness kind of.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Oh, they feel it too.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Maybe.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** We all feel it?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** Maybe.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** No, just the ones that rolled high enough.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** They get a little cold.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:26]** But there's nothing dangerous, I would say, associated with this door.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Do you want to open it?

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Sure.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** Let's roll to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** Would you like me to open it?

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** I didn't sense anything about it.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** Yeah, should we take a peek inside?

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** I'll open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Roller would be the one to know.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:44]** As he's coming down, he sees the damaged wall where the other door was completely destroyed to the point where it won't open.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** And the damage to the wall starts to lessen.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** And this door is going to be tight.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** So you can't just push it open.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I need a strength check.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Who's the strongest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** That would be moi, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** So comfortable.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Yeah, I'm not really known for that.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** I mostly keep paperwork.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** Strength of physical prowess, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Yes, well, it's only a 10, I'm afraid.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Actually, what's your strength modifier, Wooloo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:20]** Well, if I had to just roll this, just to try totally unstretched, I would naturally get a natural 20.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:26]** So, you know, sometimes it's about how you throw your weight around and just how strong you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** All right, Rory, you give it a shot.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** How about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** I rolled a natural 20, but I have a plus zero.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** My strength is 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** So Thaddeus is like, I got this.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** And doesn't do anything.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** And Rose is like, just step out of the way.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Come on.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** And nudges the door open.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:51]** Maybe using a little bit of his engineering understanding.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** He's just trickery, man.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** He did some trickery stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** You know him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:01]** He must have betrayed the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** I'm sorry, what was that?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Did you say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** I think I was just lost for a minute again.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** I'm really tired.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I keep rolling ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** Good one to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Roll those steps inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** All right, so this room, you can see...

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:31]** There are rows of shelves that crowd this chamber, though some have partially collapsed.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:40]** Most hold boxes, and from the boxes that have fallen over, you can see that they are full of old documents, even scrolls and parchment.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:47]** Other shelves have bundles of cabling and power cells and test equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:54]** What could we determine is the function of this room based on the debris?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:11]** I think like the way the shelves are set up and, uh, kind of like the way that they're boxed, you can tell that this is probably like a storage, you know, not quite a warehouse, like a storage locker, like an evidence locker or something that you would like have kind of like an evidence locker.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** I think that's a bad term before, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:34]** but like like maybe like a laboratory can i do an engineering check is that relevant to figure out maybe the purpose if there's any like specialty items that i would recognize is it a culture check um you could give me a mysticism here yeah okay somewhat magical i got an 18 on a mysticism


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Yeah.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** I only got a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** But you guys are standing from the door.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Does anybody want to move in?

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** I moved in.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Roll loose inside.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** Yeah, like at the door.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** You're standing in the middle of the door.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Roll loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Go for them inside.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Go.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** Tremaine's going to systematically go through the room.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Kevin's such a fucking sucker.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Damn it, Kevin.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** You must buy in by sacrificing your character in order to no one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:08]** No, as you step into the room and you actually walk over, there's a box that's fallen off the shelf, and there are scrolls that have fallen and rolled out of it.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:21]** You can tell these scrolls are a pre-gap form of containing magic, where post-gap technology uses spell gems before the gap.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:25]** They use scrolls to contain small bits of magic.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** But they function the exact same way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** Oh, I'm very interested in these writings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Here, you take a look at these.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** I'll take a look at these over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** What language are they in?

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** All right, I'll come in now.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** So you're going to pick up one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Yeah.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Okay, so you pick up the first scroll.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** I climb up and start reading.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** And it has...

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:57]** It has a tag on it that reads danger acidic mist in common.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:09]** And then when you unroll it, there is a rough drawing of a skeleton lying horizontally and a green cloud kind of scrolled over it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:14]** And it's got some kind of language on there that you can't decipher.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** None of you guys know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** They made this in a primitive PowerPoint.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:23]** The graphics are a little common, if I have to say so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:28]** Picture's worth a thousand words, they say, but I still can't read this shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** Yeah, if we can't read it, then we can't use it.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** It's like Ikea directions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:39]** Could I spend time deciphering these to get acid spray or whatever it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Acidic mist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:47]** Well, you would be able to use a mysticism check, and if you score high enough, you'd be able to know the language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Sure, yeah.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Should I aid, or do I have my own roll?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** It's your call.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Does a 19 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Let's get John's aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** My aid is, yes, I successfully aid.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** I got a 23 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:11]** So 21 is enough that you are able to use acidic mist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** Do I just add it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** What language?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** You just add a scroll of acidic mist.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** You get one usage of acidic mist.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** What other scrolls are here?

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Can we try and see what else there is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Sure.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** So you pick up the next scroll.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** This one doesn't have a label on it.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:37]** You go to unroll it and it actually almost just crumbles in your hands.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:46]** So from your knowledge of spell gems, when they're finished and used, they crack and almost crumble into pieces.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** They're held together by that magic.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** These scrolls seem similar.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:53]** So when you pick that next one up, it almost turns to ash and just falls apart.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** And so you start reaching through and

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** Yeah, and you start picking up every other one you touch.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** They start crumbling, but there's one that you're able to grab onto.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:05]** You pick that up.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:23]** You unroll it, and what you see is there's an orange circle and a blue circle, and there's two lines going into the orange circle, and then there's a few more lines and a circle, almost like a stick figure.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** And the stick figures hand their lines radiating from it.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** So go ahead and give me a mysticism check on that.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** All right, I'll do that.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** Or you can roll me just like a nerd culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:44]** I got a 26 on culture for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** I was making a reference to Portal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Seems like it, yeah.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** That's what I thought.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** I really missed.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** That's kind of what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** I thought he was going Fireball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Orange Circle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Okay, anyways.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:05]** It's Planar Phase, Drift Crisis page 139, so you get one usage of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:09]** Ooh, I'll take this Treme, if you would like acidic mist.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** You should let Treme have some things, yeah.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:16]** Treme takes a lot of things, and I can also cast magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:28]** Well, you know, I am the yeoman chief, and I am in charge of, you know, handing out things, so if you want this scroll, you can have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** To me, it does some magical whistle-wazzle every now and again.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Don't be selfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Make sure that you get something, alright?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** He does have acidic mist.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** That should be enough to sate his curiosity.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** I'll keep the planer mist.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** Don't talk about what you don't know, that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** Again, you go digging through the scrolls.

**[00:42:49 - 00:43:00]** You unravel one that shows... It shows on one side things hovering, and it's almost like a crappy drawing of a wizard, and things are hovering around it.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:09]** And then it has almost like an arrow pointing to the next scene, where everything is on the ground, including the wizard.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** My God.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** And you would know that this is, well, I'll give it to you.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** This is reverse gravity.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:24]** But as you're studying it, it feels very flimsy and weak, and there's no energy to that.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** It'll crumble if you try to use it.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:33]** Another one you notice actually has a label on it that says planar adaptation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:40]** But that one is also very raggedy and about to fall apart.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:51]** And lastly, there's a spell gem that is cracked that says summon drift beacons on it.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Whoa.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** But that's definitely not usable either.

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:01]** There is one last spell gem that's in a baggie and that's labeled security seal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Okay.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Oh, I know what that is from Pierce times.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** You could like seal a door with some magic or something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Interesting.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** That's pretty good.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** This could come in handy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Good knowledge, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** There's actually a spell called security seal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** I was once a caster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** I'll take it unless you want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** Let me get one more perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Give it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** I got a 17 on my perception this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** I'm feeling a little bit better.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:37]** I got a 24 on my perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:54]** So as you guys are digging through these skulls, these scrolls, not skulls, and moving boxes around, you actually notice a panel behind the shelves, and you're able to pull that panel open, and there's actually a pistol in there.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** It is a zero pistol frostbite class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** I'll take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** I know this spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Get it because it's a gun?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Does anybody else want this?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** I mean, yeah, why not?

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:20]** That might... Should we... Should we... Should we do the old... Should we play Rock, Paper, Scissors for it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:24]** Rock, Paper, Scissors.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** That sounds good.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** Let's rock some paper and scissors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** On shoot?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** Wait, are we actually doing it rock, paper, scissor on the Zoom?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Yeah, apparently.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Three-way?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** How does that even work?

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** We could.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** I thought we were just rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** Why can't we just roll a dice?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Would you just like to roll instead?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** I think we should do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** Termaine's like, guys, I've got these little number rocks.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Let's try those instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Let's try these math rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** Instead of the very flawed zoom.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:02]** Chuck, you and I can play rock, paper, rock, data pad, scissors, looter.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** I got a 16.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** I got a 15.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Damn it.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** I got a four.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** Oh!

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:11]** All right.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** So... Torme with the hot hand.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Torme has the danger aesthetic mist.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** Rolu has the planar phase.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:34]** Rolu has the security seal and you have the zero pistol glad you guys got that all figured out where are you moving next let's see that looks nice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** Let's go north.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** Let's keep working our way through these rooms.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Sure.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** So there is a door to the north of this room.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** Are you going to go out that door or are you going to go out and around the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** Is that to the hallway that's adjacent that we went through?

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** Can I, looking through from the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** So Chuck just moved out of the room.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Chuck goes through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** Yeah, I was going to talk about something, but that's cool.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** It sounds like we're not.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** What?

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Don't talk, John.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** What do you want to talk about?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** It's just interesting.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** I'm talking to y'all.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** It's just interesting.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** There are all these magics around the Drift.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:13]** This is from 300 years ago.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** By my reckoning...

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:18]** Had Triune gifted the drift?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:24]** It must be probably soon after that the stellar flare took flight.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Curious what their mission was.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** There's many curious things about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** I think it might be related to the mystical stuff that we've been encountering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:37]** Oh, you think it's related to the tingling that I felt, the ghosts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** Yeah, I'm beginning to think it wasn't really your conscience.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** There is some really weird stuff out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:43 - 00:48:12]** speaking of tingling so as you guys have this conversation chalk slips through that door to the north and you know you guys notice like out of the corner of your eye you see his his leaves all kind of spike up as he gets to that door because he turned that corner and he sees a Lashinta in a lab coat with all of the complexion and red hair and she slowly walks north


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:18]** That's the noise that Chuck makes.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Chuck, are you okay?

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:29]** It's a ghost.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** A ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Roy walks out.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** We know it's an actual ghost.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** Sorry, you saw this ghost looking at... There's nothing that I can see.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** There's nothing here, man.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** I don't see anything.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:48]** I'm not saying you're wrong, I just... Chuck's the only one that's seen these things so far, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yes.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Yes, he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** I love it.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:02]** So, earlier Chuck saw a long, dark-haired human...

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** That just disappeared randomly.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Nobody else saw him.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:13]** And now this time he's claiming that he saw LaShunta with red hair and olive complexion.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** And yet, no one else saw her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:22]** Was there anything in that room that we were just in that would indicate a personnel log or a roster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** A manifest, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** You didn't see anything in that room.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:31]** And like we mentioned before, that room is probably more of some kind of...

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** I wouldn't... It's an organized storage system, right?

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:39]** I wouldn't say it's evidence, because that sounds like you're in a police locker.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:45]** But, you know, that's not where the personnel records would be, is all I'm saying.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:50]** Guys, as I live and breathe, she was beautiful.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:59]** I mean, she was... But... This place gets creepier and creepier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** I believe you, man.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** Quick, Rolo, go to the edge of the hallway.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Let's see if it went either way.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** Let's follow her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** I don't know if I should follow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Shock, which way did she go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Which way, Shock?

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** She went this way.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Which way is this way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** I can't see that well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Marco!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:26]** Whoa, what is this big door over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** Rolo, you have to say Polo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Polo.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Say my name.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Sorry.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Polo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Say my name, say my name.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** No one is around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Who is Marco Polo?

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** I'll explain more later.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** All right.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** So you guys left that hallway.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** You're on the north side of that first set of rooms.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** This is kind of like a grid system.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:59]** So you're now in the east corridor that goes north and south about, I think, 120 feet, if I remember correctly, without counting squares.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** So you now have come up, and there is a doorway that

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:35]** a large double door on the outer wall and then there's more you know walls in other directions so it looks like there's a divider wall which we talked about before has a bunch of electronics kind of throughout it so it is a wall but it's also utility of some sort some kind of power control system or gauges of some sort that read off stuff

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:41]** This other wall here is clearly some kind of room, and you can see that it goes around.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** As you reach the north side of the map, that hallway kind of bends to the left, makes a sharp left.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:54]** So you can go down the hallway where you are now, or you can go up and to the left, or you can go through this big red door.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** So what do you guys want to do now?

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** Let's check each door as they come along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** What do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** I agree with you.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Let's check this red door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Yep.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:12]** I think not to metagame, that puts us on another map, probably.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Possibly.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Or it could be like the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:24]** I think what Torme is trying to say is, this looks like an exit door, and the rest of them look like interior doors, the ones that we've walked past.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Maybe we should finish looking through this space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Chuck, you're very perceptive.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** Why don't we confirm if it is an exit, and then we'll know that we have more than one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** Rulu, I think you're in the business of confirming doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Why don't you go through the exit?

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:42]** This is the note I want to make for myself, is to oversize every map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:49]** So, John, oversize every map so that they can't be like, oh, this is the far side of the map.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** There's nothing else going on here.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** But, yes, this door may or may not lead to something.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** So if you want to open it, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:12]** give me a strength check we'll go look through the rest of the rest of the doors you don't need to go anywhere I just think it could be good to check I got a 15 to see if it goes outside or if I think it's sealed enough to just be another area of the ship

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** I'm not opening it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Do you guys remember what you did?

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** Do you remember what happened the last time you opened one of these big red doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Yeah, at a bunch of sand.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:19]** Oh.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Yep.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Okay, same thing.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** All right, then.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Well, down this middle hallway.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Okay.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** There was some door that was open at the far end of this one.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Slow down.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Oh, there it goes.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:40]** Whoa, there's just sand in the middle of the... Where did all this... Yeah, where did the sand come from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:40]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Thanks, Kevin.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:46]** I'm glad you like... Chuck, are you buried under the sand?

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** There's sand now.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** You see?

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Oh, I see the sand.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** Thanks.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** I made sands for doing that.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Nice.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** That was refreshing.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:58]** So Thaddeus takes another whiz in the sand, and then we move along our way.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** Gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** All right, there's more intersections here.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:09]** So there's like an almost four-way intersection-ish intersection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:24]** You guys open up that door, and as you even start to crack it, just sand starts to fall through, and Rolu's able to crank it open and almost gets pushed by the sand and almost trips, but you're able to recover.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:30]** Then you guys kind of back up, and you go straight down the hallway in front of that door.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:35]** As you start to approach, at the end of the hallway...

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** It's actually Thaddeus.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Holy shit.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** Yeah, I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Thaddeus.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** I think I faintly see it.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Some ephemeral woman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** That was actually a male with long black hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Wait, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** I could have fooled me.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** I mean, no, he was beautiful.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Do you believe me now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Yes.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** I believe you.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** Yes, I believe you, Chuck.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** I was not believing you.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** We've been under a lot, you know.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Yes.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** It's easy to confuse things.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** It really is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Maybe we're all a little confused.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** I don't know.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:22]** I'm going to roll perception to see if I know anything about now that I've seen the spirit.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Man, I cannot roll.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Yeah, I can't either.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** I got a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Yeah, I also got a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:54]** there's nothing I've seen nothing like this before Thaddeus sees this sort of Claymore retirement what was that again like some kind of you get in that explosive that whoever Treme I think left right of course it was Treme Will was the one that left it I was like I knew it had to be so then like we came across we're now on the other side of that

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** So we're just north of that.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** What's the range on that again, Thaddeus?

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Because I see.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Thaddeus.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** To me.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Are you losing it?

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Shut up.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** I just saw a beautiful ghost of a man, all right?

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** I don't see my drawing anymore.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** I had a drawing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** You're right.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** I was hoping you guys would forget about it completely.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** So I know the range on it.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** I still have your drawing.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:23]** But if you guys would have walked past it, I was going to trigger it on you.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** So.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** Didn't we go around it though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Because isn't it like right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** You have not stepped in it yet Is it in this hallway though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** I would know You can see it right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:44]** No I can't see it It looks like a claymore You can't see it because you're not around the corner It's right there Yeah Is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** You can see the claymore right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:52]** I can see it It's funny because on my map that is all fog of war I can't see anything Oh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** So, like, we could do 25 feet.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:59]** We can stay as far as 25 feet away from it.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** That's not far enough, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** It was... I'll be fair with you.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** It was a five-foot roof.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** It was a five-foot roof.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Oh, okay.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** So we're okay.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** I remember that.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** I was just hoping you guys would completely forget and, like, go wandering in the hallway.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** Bam!

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** You're dinged!

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** What's this pile of junk?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:14]** Yeah, because it was a flashbang is what he put there, right?

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:19]** Okay, so you guys are now at the crossroads.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** So you're at this, like, weird zigzag area with those...

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:30]** electronic corridor dividers are kind of offset just enough that it's not a straight line going down the middle of the map.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** You have to kind of zigzag, but you're right.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:42]** If you make a left, you're going south, and there is that corner, that intersection where you put the flashbang and turn it into a mine.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:49]** So now your other options are just go straight ahead where you saw that man and

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:55]** Or you can go up right next to you or up behind you.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** You can go back and up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:03]** That is dazed by the beauty of the man and wants to keep moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** It's like a Starfinder siren.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** Yeah, his pupils get really, really big.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:16]** Chuck, isn't this where we are standing near where you saw this man the first time, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** We are, yeah.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:20]** That's not going straight down that hall and then north.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Let's follow.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Wait, slow down a second.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** Chuck is making his way down town.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** Chuck, maybe slow down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:36]** Right, so you guys are walking down the hallway towards where that man was.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:44]** But as you step into that opening that heads straight north, there are two doors on each side of that hallway.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:48]** And straight ahead of you, there's a strange darkness.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:55]** And you see this cloud of darkness start to fade away.

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:00]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:00]** 22.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** 19.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** 22.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** 8.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** Rolo's still around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:09]** Yeah, Rolo blind as a bat.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:20]** As a dark cloud starts to fade away and recede, you actually catch a glimpse of what looks like a leg passing through.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** A closed door.
