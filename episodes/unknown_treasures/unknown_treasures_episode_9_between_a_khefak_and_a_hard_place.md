## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:03]** All right, welcome back to Unknown Treasures, a part of We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:06]** Before we start, I just, John, I have a question for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:08]** Whoa, that was right out of the gate.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** You're like speeding through it and then you're like sharp left turn.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** John, I got no foreplay, just like right in.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** No, it's related.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** I was listening to that intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:24]** The guitars in that intro, are those synthetic robot guitars or is that you actually like thrashing on some metal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** Dude, no synthetic guitar would ever sound like that.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** All right.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:34]** For as far... That says less about me and more about the state of MIDI technology.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Unless I'm wrong.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** Unless there are some plug-ins that you know out there.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:48]** For some reason, truly, MIDI technology cannot ever... Like, not even in a good way can it make guitars sound like guitars.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** I don't know what it is yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** It's good to know that musicians have time yet before technology...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** That's when you know... Robot uprising.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Yeah.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:07]** A bunch of Terminators walking with guitars, just like... You just need to program robots to play guitars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Wow, this is good.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Actually, that is probably the better, faster way to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** And the conversation comes full circle.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Like, that's the problem with MIDI.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** You can't have a machine play a guitar like a human can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** What does MIDI stand for again, Vinny?

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:50]** oh music uh music input digital interface i think yeah it's basically just like hang on yeah i feel like it like it's just since i feel like musical instrument digital interface yeah which is funny because it was built on um what's called dmx which is how digital lighting is controlled so musician was like oh that's a pretty neat protocol let me just use that to control my instruments

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** That is impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:56]** There are some MIDI instruments in the intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** The flute is a MIDI instrument.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** So that guitar you did yourself at the intro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Oh, that's impressive.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Thanks.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** But yeah, the flute's a MIDI instrument.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** It's like he's a real musician.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:12]** I kind of knew that when I asked, but every time I listen to it, I'm like, I need to see John live.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** I still haven't.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** He's so good.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** Everybody, you should go try to listen to John.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** You guys can't see it, but I'm wearing his old band's t-shirt.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** Night Market.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Wait, those t-shirts exist?

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** How come I didn't get a Night Market t-shirt?

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Oh, dude, look at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** I still have some, actually.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** This is a good one.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** There was another one that was a little weird.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** I want the weird one.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** You want the weird one?

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Why is it weird?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** I've been wearing this shirt for like four years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:44]** It was, I don't know, John, you went on, there was some random person was like, yeah, I'll design it for you with like no input whatsoever.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:52]** And it just turned out to be like, it was a head with like words written into it, like the outline of a head and it's like night market kind of scribbled inside.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** And it's very strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:58]** Yeah, it's like a fever dream of somebody telling you that their band's called Night Market.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** Somebody went to a Phish concert and was like, I'm going to make a t-shirt for John's band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Dude, Phish is so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** This one's a lot better.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:15]** It says Night Market down one side, and then it shows a barcode across it, but then it's a black palm tree kind of breaking up the barcode.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** It's a really cool shirt for a really cool band.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** You should look them up on Spotify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** It kind of looks kind of vaporwave-y.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** We've dropped their link before.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** You should drop it again, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Noted.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Sounds good.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:37]** Also, at some point, I think we talked about you'll be able to hear the single that I'm going to release with Vinny helping to mix.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Ooh.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Yeah.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Yeah, good times.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I'm looking forward to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** What's the mixing space set up?

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Yeah, right.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** What's the topic of your single?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** What's it about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** It's called Over Your Shoulder.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** I like you getting stalked by someone.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** No, that's a good interpretation, though.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** It's like a favorite dream.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Or like you move past something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** You can't ask an artist to interpret his art form for you.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** You'll just have to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** I don't know.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** I don't know the protocol for this kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:10]** Speaking of interpreting art... Masterwork subscription.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:28]** sorry just the justin bieber song about oh i don't need no lyrics about basically like if i can't if i can't admit like love you in life then i'll love you when you're gone type thing oh yeah yeah yeah have you listened to those lyrics it sounds like he's gonna murder somebody selena

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:57]** just listen to the lyrics somebody look it up I don't randomly listen to Justin Bieber although some of his songs are kind of good it's on the radio all the time it's a Justin Bieber song I watched the video for it and it's in the video it's like an older woman I'm assuming like a mother figure or an aunt or something and he's talking about if he can't be close to you in life as it is then he will love you through your memories I'll settle for the ghost of you

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Yeah.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** And I'm sure it's like somebody passed away.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:03]** But like, if you listen to that again, it's like, are you talking about murdering them?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Like, if I can't love you, nobody else can.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** That's suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** It's disturbing.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** Anyways, who wrote that song?

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** I wonder.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:27]** I just hear it whenever I, whenever I hear that song, I'm like, Oh God, cringe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:31]** So I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** Your memory is ecstasy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** I miss you more than life.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:56]** I wanted to, I was talking to John last night, I wanted to bring this up, but we talked about the Star Wars holiday special, which is like something that was created, I think possibly in like the late 70s, but it's a full length movie that George Lucas was really proud of initially.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:19]** all of it i've never seen it what's you really honestly yeah need to see it because like it has it actually has like luke and leia and han like you know mark hamill all the carrie fisher and and uh han anyway all these like real actors like were in it but like half the movie i was telling john last night this this no name yeah harrison yeah uh what's his name but like

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:25]** But anyway, like, basically half of the movie is just, like, Wookiees, like, shouting at each other on a cat sheet.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** Literally with no subtitles at all.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** They're just literally talking to each other the entire time.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:35]** And it makes you don't understand a single f***ing thing that they're saying.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** And then, like, Luke and Han and Leia show up.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** And they're like, oh.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** And they're, like, the only, like, relief from that.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** But there's all these weird shorts.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** There's, like, Bea Arthur in it.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** And, like, a bunch of weird s*** going on.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** It's very, very bad.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** And, like, after...

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** Yeah, it's like a musical.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** I hate it.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:56]** And then Lucas, he hated it so much that he tried to erase it from the earth.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** He's like, all right, stop all distribution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I did hear about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Take it off.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:04]** Honestly, if you're a Star Wars fan, you really should watch the holiday special.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** It's canon, sort of.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** Anyway, just check it out.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** That's all I'll say, okay?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** And I hope you enjoyed Obi-Wan.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** It's now August, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:22]** On a related note, just to make everybody feel old, especially Will, because he was probably alive back then.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** American Graffiti.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:31]** American Graffiti, which is George Lucas' takeoff film featuring Harrison Ford as the bad guy.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:36]** That movie came out in 1973, which is one year away from being 50 years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Wow.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** Oh, happy birthday, George Lucas' first notable film, I think, and then also Harrison Ford.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:43 - 00:09:07]** wait was it also harrison ford's well no sorry harrison ford's debut but that's uh that's pretty cool i've never seen american graffiti he's the bad guy in that i want to see that he i mean there's no like real bad guy you should watch it it's a great movie it's a good movie okay cool i've never seen he's kind of a he's kind of a i don't know he's yeah he's the the challenger is like grand torino kind of jerk or like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:12]** It's about teenagers in the hot rod world of the 1960s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** It's like a love letter to the drag culture.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** Not drag like drag queen, but drag like... Drag race.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** Got it.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Drag racing.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Cruisin'.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Cruisin' culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:29]** Also, on a related note, I kind of look like Ron Howard, especially in that film.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:35]** And so I was picked up to be an actor for a small film called... Shoot, I don't remember the name of it anymore.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:43]** Hot Rod Angel, which was supposed to be a 45-minute film, which I thought had a fantastic story.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:49]** And then it stretched into an hour-and-a-half-long film with a series connected to it and dragged out.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** It never got completed.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** You were in a movie.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** It never got released.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** But that's cool.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Were you the main character?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Well, yeah.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** I played basically like the Ron Howard character.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** What the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** I want to see this.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Wait, Kevin, do you have a copy of it?

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** That's awesome, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** I do somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Kevin, this is a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** I'd watch it.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Wait, why don't we stream it for the Discord?

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** We can have a watch party together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** Yes, yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Probably get sued.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** That would be so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** I'll try to find a picture of it or something.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** No, we need to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** You can't rebroadcast our...

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** You're like this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:30]** We had a replica of the 32 coupe from American Graffiti.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** That's awesome.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Kevin, I was fine with this.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** I'm so angry that I didn't get this.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Right after high school, 2004, 2005.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I think we're really cutting into our time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** If anyone else starred in a movie, we would want to see this.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Plus one in the Discord if you want to see this movie.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** We'll keep this tight.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:51]** I actually, I picked a number in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** So it's whoever's closest to that number gets to go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** Gets to go.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** That sounds like the opposite of winning.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** It's going to be like 15.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** It's fine.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Kev, are you drinking wine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** No, it's actually the rum.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Spiced rum that you guys gave me.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Thank you.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Nice.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:05]** Cotton reed.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** So wait, what are your numbers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** The dry rum or the allspice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** I ran out of the dram.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** The all-star dram.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Because it was too good.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** I drank it too fast.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:15]** I chugged it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** What are your numbers, Finny?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** Oh, I was still, like, shaking it in my hand.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Hang on.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Thirteen.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Thirteen, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** And you were also rolling the die, too.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Yeah.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** John, what did you roll?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Got a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** Kevin, curious, what was the number that you picked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Kelly, what number did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** I got a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I rolled, I was thinking seven.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** So John actually landed right on my number.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** No jokes.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** Wait, so if you get the number, that means you're immune this round, right?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** And then someone else gets to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** No, it means you go.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:52]** So tell us, Rolu, you're on stage.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** Give us two truths and one lie, not in that particular order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** Exactly in that particular order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** I think Rolu is very... He's not nervous on stage, but he just doesn't know what to do.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** He's just not an actor.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:18]** So I think if he's on stage, then he just is very... He has this thing where you move a lot, because before you get on stage, you don't know that moving is like... You should just plant your feet and be in one place.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** So he kind of shuffles a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:27]** Well, in this case, he's actually sitting down in a room with him and just like a single person in front of a camera.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** So don't be too nervous.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Please relax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:37]** Is this like an interrogation room with like the one really bright light in the middle swinging back and forth gently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** There's actually like a table with some water and some candy next to you.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:56]** couple of houseplants is this like modern family yeah very modern family-ish sorry what kind of candy is this um there's actually three bowls one is skittles one is m&ms and the last one is um some caramel wrapped up caramel


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** I think, of course, the third one is like a candy from like 100 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:05]** It's actually these ones were manufactured.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** They found a box backstage that was marked 1929.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:15]** It's one of those cookie tins that looks like it should be yarn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Okay.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** That's a phenomenon.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** You know that, right?

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** You've all experienced this, right?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** Like where like your mom will hide like sewing supplies and like that Danish cookie.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** That's the worst fake out ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Our crayons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** It wouldn't suck so much if every, like, 10th time there was actually cookies in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Crayons?

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:37]** Wait, did you hide crayons in it or crayons?

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Crayons.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Okay.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** Crayons without hiding around in boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** The Y-O-N is the Y-O-N.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Crayons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Got you.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Crayons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Anyways, Ralu.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Ralu, tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:58]** Well, I think right before that happens, as soon as you point out the candy, each of his like one hand goes to the water.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** One hand goes to each of the bowls.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** And then he's like taking each of the candy there.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** I guess he's a little nervous.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Unwrapping the caramel one-handed.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Well, he grabs it.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:17]** Yeah, well, one hand puts the Skittles, then it starts to unwrap the toffee.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** You know, all that kind of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** I feel like heroes would just love watching you do things with all your hands.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** That sounds kind of weird, actually.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:30]** But my point is, like, four hands, I just feel like you'd be kind of talented at watching things.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Sorry, Gavin.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** No, I'm just writing on Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Yeah, I'm rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** My bad.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** All right.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** All right.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** Two truths and a lie.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Not really.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Not really that quick on my feet.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Let's see here.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:58]** I think first statement, that's what I'll call them.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:04]** First statement is that I enjoy painting.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:17]** My second statement is that I like my tea with two sugars.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:30]** And the third statement is that I was once a person of interest person.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** On a Xeno Warden ship.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** That's all that I have to say.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** And then each hand takes more candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** As he's making his tea and he drops in three sugars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** We'll have to.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Yeah, right.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** We'll have to do a Starfinder story time about Xeno Warden.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** I don't know what that is.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Oh, yeah, we should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** Prep that for next week, John.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** I'm going to start off with the fact that we already know that Rolu paints.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** We know that for a fact.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:01]** He's talked about it in a couple of flashbacks and in the beginning of the series.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** So that one is a truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** He could be a masochist.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** Just, like, does it because he doesn't enjoy it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:19]** What if it's just, like, a giant, like, what if they all form, like, a map to something, like a star map to something?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** That'd be kind of cool.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:26]** Like, isn't, you know, it's just Rolu's secret stash somewhere in the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Sorry, one sec.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** I'm going to just take that note down somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** I think that'd be a cool twist.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** It's really hard to know.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:40]** I wish I knew Rolu better, but I feel like it would be... I should know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** I'm guessing it's like... I think the tea with two sugars is the lock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** Yeah, it's got to be that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** Yeah, I think he takes his tea back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** No, I don't know.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** I think he has some sugar in it.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** The Xenomorph thing is very weirdly specific, so I would really actually go for the third one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:02]** Yeah, the second one seems like a misleading one on purpose a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** It's so hard to know.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** Maybe I'll change my one to three as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:12]** It's really hard to know what's truth and what's lie to a fictional character.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** Truth or lies to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** You just have to go off of what you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** All right, so final guesses.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Will, you think that he's lying about the Xeno Wardens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** I'm going to say he's lying about the two sugars in his tea.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** I think he's lying about painting.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** I think he secretly hates it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** And Kelly, what do you think?

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:39]** If you do that, it will crush my headcanon.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:44]** I'm going to say Roloo would want to be a badass with number three, I feel.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** But then I wonder if he's just making that.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** I'm going to go with number three as well.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** So, John, reveal the lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:00]** Before I do that, can I just tell you, Roloo has an intelligence of 16, but a wisdom of nine.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Okay.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:09]** So he's not clever, but his idea of clever is not that deep.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** So the lie...

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** Is that he tastes his tea with one sugar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Yes!

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Oh, come on, Roloo.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** He's so Roloo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Okay, question.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** What is the unit of sugar?

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Is it like a sugar cube?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Yeah, that's what he said.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** It's like a gram.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Can we have the metric system?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Yeah.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** Can we ask him?

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:36]** Well, just like some sugar cubes are bigger than others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** How big is a sugar cube?

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Can you just give us like a, you know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** I think it's like a centimeter.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Is there a standard?

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** It's a half inch?

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** Anyways.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Oh, is there?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** No, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Two would be kind of too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:51]** It depends on whether you buy the sugar cube in America or not in America.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** I'll take a standard.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** Space America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** John, can we ask about the Xeno Wardens or is that going to be a secret?

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Well kept.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** No, I mean.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** Just give us a little bit of insight on the Xeno Wardens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** You could always ask him about this in general.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:18]** So all Kasothans go on a tempering for about a year at which they... It's kind of like... What's the term?

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Rumspringer.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:29]** You have a year where you go out and you find out about things about your own personal beliefs and you try and do a lot of different things.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** And at one point, he was...

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:44]** around an area in castravel a moon that was probably not where you should have been and the xeno wardens were like uh well we're gonna apprehend you and ask you some questions

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** You could always ask him about his time at the tempering.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** It's always... Cool.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:52]** I'm sure most Kasatans have an interesting story from that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:53 - 00:21:01]** All right, John, I am going to task you to do a Starfinder story time about the Xeno Wardens whenever you are ready for that, whether it's this episode, next episode, or four episodes from now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** Yes, please.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** I want that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:14]** But from my brief understanding of Xeno Wardens, they're basically like natural resource officers or the fish and game or whatever they're called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** The Ranger Ricks and Rachels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:22]** Yeah, so they're protecting the wildlife of apparently Castorville.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Cool.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Well, I think it is time to play.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Let's play.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** I think this is a good lead-in.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:32]** Let me give you a quick rundown of what happened in the last episode, in case it's been a while.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** Like a week, because you listen every week, right?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** In case it's been a while.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:43]** So last week, these guys investigated a body found in the middle of an opening of an intersection between three routes.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:48]** And they noted that the body belonged to an android member of the True Warriors.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** That android was shot.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:59]** You actually analyzed them and investigated enough that you realized it was shot and not just killed by some other natural being.

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** I got shot.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:29]** so then you also guys looked at the you guys looked at the tracks and you found three heading off into the north part of this triangular pathway and you saw one kind of break off in a run to the west which actually loops back around to that tire mountain you guys followed that those tracks and you just found that pile of tires and you also found an auto target rifle with some ammo

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:43]** Then you headed back to the intersection to pursue the rest of those tracks, and you came to a river of toxic ooze with a shaky scrap bridge crossing it, and you proceeded to cross cautiously.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:50]** On the other side, you found two pyramids of crushed chassis, and Thaddeus actually recognized these ziggurats.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Ziggurats?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** How do you pronounce that word?

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Ziggurats.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Ziggurats.

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:11]** pyramids uh to be kafak nests um so yeah that's where we're at and so i think thaddeus points out that there's hundreds of tiny vermin kind of crawling in and out of these chassis and there are so many creatures that the metal he didn't say it yet but he'll point it out

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Yeah, he's going to point this out to the other guys.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** I'm dictating what Thaddeus is doing, sorry.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** But the battle itself is actually kind of like thrumming.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** It's moving just a little bit.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** But they're tiny creatures, so take that for what it is.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** Can I get all of you guys to roll an initiative as I move you over to the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Wait, we're automatically going into battle?

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** We can't not go into battle, possibly?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** I meant perspective.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** I didn't say perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** Perspective?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Perceptions?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Like arts?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** Perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** I feel like a ruler would be the best at that.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** GMing is super hard for me, guys.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** I don't think you understand this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:59]** On the flip side, can I just say real quick that being a player, I am thinking about things as a GM, and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm a player.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** I get it, Kev.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** It's hard being in the backseat.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You got to switch.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** No, it's...

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:15]** It's not the role change per se, other than I probably sometimes elucidate more than I should.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** But it's more like thinking about my character.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Hang on.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** I got to Google that word.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** As like my character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** I want to know what that definition is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** Elucidate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** John, I'm going to need a Starfighter story time for elucidate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:42]** okay uh okay to make clear all right so what are these perception checks i got a 20 dope 20 for thaddeus uh chuck got a dirty 20 as well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** I got a natural 20, though.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** Wait, actually, fine.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Your 20 is better than my 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:52]** Sorry, I lied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** It's a plus one for perception.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Dirty 20.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Shaq might be more perceptive than me.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Rolo got a natural one for a total of four.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:09]** Because I think Rolo ran in and is more concerned about Chak standing in the center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Oh, right.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Because I kept Leroy Jenkinson this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Chak will be the test.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** Well, Chak's currently on your shoulder, right?

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:46]** no I think I thought Jack ran ahead no that was at the tires this time he was on your shoulder right yeah which by the way I believe that falls we talked about we didn't know exactly about the mounting rules but that falls under survival check right is it I believe so really have you stayed mounted riding to stay mounted yeah so let's Vinny take a look at that while we talk about this a little bit more so wait Rolu and Vinny what did you guys roll just be clear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** 30, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:52]** Okay, so if you're looking at the map, you guys can see the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, I can see the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:02]** So you guys are kind of standing in the southwest corner of these two fairly large cubic pyramids known as ziggurats.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** I mumbled that word, so I don't have to say it right.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** You're saying it right.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** And actually, Tremaden, you're kind of last one.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:13]** You're still kind of on the janky bridge coming across the toxic oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Janky bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:32]** And while you guys are looking at these two towers, these two pyramids, two cigarettes, you can see actually three Kafaks kind of minding their own business and eating away and doing whatever they're doing on their nests.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** Rolu and Chakzo actually see a fourth one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Wait, I don't think Rolu did.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** He rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** Well, Rolo, you're pretty tall, so you saw it.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Okay.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** This is making up for that other time I took it away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** How big is the pile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** How tall?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:59]** This pile, so there's two layers to this, and so I'm going to say each layer is seven feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Okay, so kind of tall, 14 foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** Yeah.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** Somebody else, did anybody want to roll an engineering check or anything on these?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:30]** sure i'll roll an engineering using my raven and riddle raven riddles sponsor please yeah okay it's 12 kelly watch scream 12 i i'll say you from from that you're like man these these look sturdy enough i think you can make it up there

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:38]** So with that, I'll say that there will be... I'm not going to tell you exactly what, but there will be an athletics check if you want to climb each layer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** I think we should just avoid these things.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** Yeah.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:48]** So Thaddeus will tell the group, he's like, I recommend everyone be as stealthy as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Did you say...

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** How good is their hearing?

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** He's like turning around to you, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** Thaddeus... Let's see.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** Thaddeus will find out by rolling a life science check.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** He did not roll high.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** He only rolled a 7.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** How noisy, how good is their hearing with a 7, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** You did a life science check, is that what you said?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Yeah, of 7, Kevin.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** I'm trying to look at their perception.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** 7, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:19]** 7, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** Their perception is not that great.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:28]** But with that said, Rolloo and Chakra are pretty much in between these two Ziggurats already.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** So go ahead and roll a stealth check for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** Don't fail me now, Raven and Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** All right, everyone, get stealth.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Get stealthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** That's 11.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:43]** That's a 19 for Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** 19 for Thaddeus if it matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Thaddeus, you're okay for now unless you're going to move further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** Well, I rolled 19, so we should be good in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:56]** Who's drawing purple marks on my map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** He's like, let's go this way, which I agree with.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** It's the way out.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** Did you draw...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:07]** We could hold them off perhaps at another choke point if we have to fight them.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** Let's not get surrounded between these ziggurats.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** That is a good choke point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Here's what happened.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:21]** As you guys are leaving the scrappy bridge, Rolu hears you say, like, hey, careful, these are nests.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** And so he starts to sneak, and he's very good at it.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:29]** He's, like, very stealthily just moving across the sand, barely leaving tracks, making no sound.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:37]** And Choc is riding his shoulders, like, clenching on real tight and going, oh, my God, I think I see something moving!


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:44]** And as he says that, two of the K'voks see him.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** And they start to make their way.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:53]** So go ahead and now, as I misspoke earlier, I need you to roll initiative.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Roll initiative?

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** No.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:00]** I'll say that the two that saw you are the ones on top of the towers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** 19, GM.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Yeah, now I get the 21.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:08]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:17]** Roloo, when you're ready, got a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** You're so distracted by Chuck.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:26]** I'm like, quiet.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Quiet, Chuck.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:30]** My favorite thing is when dice tell the story better than the storytellers themselves.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Chuck got what?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** 21.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** Termay?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Termay got a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** All right.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** That makes sense, too, because Tremé is kind of in the back of the group.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** He's still worried about getting off this bridge safely.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:48]** And he can't even see he can't really see any of these things, except for maybe the one right in front of him.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** And the two that saw them here, I'll highlight them for you.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Those two are the ones you can clearly see.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** The rest of them are kind of hidden from your perspective where you're at.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** So it makes sense that your initiative is a little lower.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:05]** Let me just give me a second here as I highlight everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** As I highlight everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:14]** Chuck, since you were so startled by these things to begin with, you get to go first.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Mind you, they saw you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** Right, so you see Chalk visibly flinch.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:29]** He starts gesturing wildly with one of his vines and uses his other tendrils to turn Cobb's head toward the fox that he's been spotted by.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:35]** And pulls out his miniature hunting rifle.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** We've been spotted!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Cool.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** Okay, so that's all free action for you.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** What do you actually want to do on your turn?

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:52]** You can delay or... Yes, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** No, because I have a zero attack bonus.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** It's a standard action for me to pull out my rifle.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** That's what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Thank you.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Yeah, because I play by the rules, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** Yep.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** All right.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:06]** Well, in that case, K'vok number two is going to go.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:14]** And so the K'vok one made this alarming, like you heard this like rumble going on because it's definitely like a lot of K'voks in these nests.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** There are a lot of infants, I'll say.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** It's a majority of these infants, these tiny little ones.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:48]** choke in on myself so you hear this rumbling hiss it's just like a constant going on but it got just a little bit louder when you realize they noticed you and so Kvok 2 is going to I have to be on the right map going to move to here oh do these things have wings they do not okay

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:53]** It is going to lash out at Choc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** How tall are these ziggurats?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Seven feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:26]** seven feet on the first step per step that was a wild guess it's it's one cubic block or whatever well actually it'd be five feet i guess would be anyways it doesn't matter they are just what's your question about i thought you said seven feet i'm a liar i'm making as i go man you're not playing by the rules and you're a liar a gm never reveals the secrets it's okay fair it could have been seven feet um i'm just like hypotenuse for its reach to yeah yeah

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:30]** Well, you're on Rolu's shoulder, and Rolu is how tall, so this is direct line of sight.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** That's true.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Anyways, John, you had a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** Yeah, did you say that you highlighted which two were the ones that noticed us?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Are they the two at this southern ziggurat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** This one and this one.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Oh, okay.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** But all of them are aware now.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** They're like groundhogs or whatever.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, that higher-pitched hiss is an alert for everybody.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** You guys are screwed.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Okay, so sorry.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Back to what I was doing.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Then... I'll count that as a roll.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:04]** That was a 7 plus 4 to hit for 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** KAC.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Miss.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:12]** So that one, it's like alerted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:19]** It comes around that corner, sees you, and it kind of like dive strikes at you, and it misses completely.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:29]** All right, Thaddeus pulls out his rifle and is going to shoot the one directly in front of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** Preferably in the face.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Being this one here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** The one directly north.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Thank you.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:40]** Right on the corner of the lower level of the ziggurat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Yeah, it's an eight to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Good lord.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Is that KC or EAC?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Okay, moving on.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Kefauk number one gets to go.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** That's the one that was on top.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:59]** And so it's going to move down a step and then move here.

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** What's its name?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Kefauk number one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Does it need a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** These are mindless, nameless creatures.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** And it's going to roll to strike.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:15]** 17 for 21 to hit KAC against Rolude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** That.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** That's a hit.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** All right.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Yes.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** I'm making movements.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** And that is 1d6 of slashing damage.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** Total of four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Could you not?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** I could not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Yeah, don't.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Don't next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** All right.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** That's the end of that K'fok's turn.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:43]** It is now K'fok number X. And now it is Termay's turn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** What's going on here, guys?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** And he's going to step up.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** And he has his semi-auto pistol already out.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** He's going to walk.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Get off the bridge.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:07]** As he does, he's going to see this first Vok that took a swipe at Rolu.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:13]** He's going to level his sidearm and take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** I have to ask, you already had the sidearm out, or are you pulling it out as you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Yeah, I just stated that.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** Does a natural 20 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** I believe it does.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** It also allows you to use critical hit rules.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** That is not the music I expected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:33]** I just totally deleted it.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Sorry.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Did I delete the thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Delete what?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** What thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Okay.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** Well, like, I deleted my character from... Yeah, his token's gone.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** From... Yeah.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Oh.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** From the world.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Can you hit control Z?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Try control Z. It might work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** Otherwise, I'll... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Oh, no.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Okay, hold on.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** I'll see.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** It didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** I'll see.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** Torme throws himself into the oil.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** I've had enough.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** I don't like these guys.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I'm done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I want to fight another time.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Awesome.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Thank you.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Nice.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** I was trying to remove my... Did you get him back?

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Yeah, he's back.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Oh, okay, cool.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yeah.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** All right, cool.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** All right, so how does... Do I... Roll twice.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** For critical, I roll twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** You roll twice and then add the bonuses twice.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** What's my bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** What's my bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:25]** So six points and... Okay, not that bad.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Ten points of damage.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Nice.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** And what are you shooting?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Tactical semi-auto pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:39]** I like, uh, Termay kind of like steps off of this bridge kind of carefully and he's got four arms too.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** So he's got two arms kind of like balancing himself.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:46]** And then he takes the other two arms and just kind of brings them up to his eyesight and shoots.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:49]** And it, it shoots right through the head.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** The brain's just burst out the side.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Nice.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** And that K'fok is dead.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Gross.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Yes.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** Well, with that said, that's how it's done.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** That is free gets to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Even more well done.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** That's too late, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** I'm just trying to one-up you.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** The moment's done, bro.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:31]** Clock number three was up on top of the tower, and you see it just burrow into the tower and come out the lower level, and it jumps right in front.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** What were you saying about a height difference?

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** Is there a penalty for...

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:42]** It's five foot range, so I guess what is the penalty for outside of five foot range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** You can't attack outside of five foot range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** I thought you could take a penalty, can't you?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** If it's a ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Yeah.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** That's for the range of the weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:57]** Well, these things are pretty dumb anyway, so they're going to think that Rolu and Chak are kind of the same creature, and so it's going to roll at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Roll at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** That is a 19 on the dice.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Dang, dog.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** So that's definitely a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** And that's four points of damage to roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** Okay, I'm just not going to take it.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** I'm going to say that's cheating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Nah.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** I'm good.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** Thanks, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Thanks.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** You do that, man.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Stick up for yourself.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** I like it.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Cool.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Good times.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Good times.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Okay.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** And then it is Fock number four's turn.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Damn.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Oh, man.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Yeah, John, I'm not feeling very good for you.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Just for the listener...

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** All these K'foks are kind of swarming on Rolu and Chak.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:48]** And one of them is dead, but there are three now lined up right in front of Rolu.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:52]** So one at his diagonal to the left, one right in front of him, and one at his diagonal to the right.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** And this one is going to swing at you.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** With a natural one.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Yes!

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:04]** So John, pull out the critical fail list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** Critical flumbo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** I know it's not a named character, but I think we should just do it for every critical.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** That's my game.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** I do what I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** That's for a kinetic weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** Yeah, that's for a... Well, there's a natural weapon.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Perfect.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** I think.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Well, it's just melee.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Because there's melee, ranged, and spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** We'll work through it, whatever happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** It's shuffled.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Let me know when you want to stop it.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Ready?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Three, two, one...

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** Stop.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Okay.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** The Cod.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** It's a... In the Cod Yards.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** The Cod Yards.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** The Cod in the Cod Yards.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** We're in the Cod Yards.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Eat dirt.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** I like it.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** That's appropriate.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:56]** You are knocked prone and must succeed at a fortitude save or be blinded for 1d3 rounds.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Wow.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Oh, that's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Let's see.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** I'm going to give...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Thank you, Starfinder.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Critical Fumble deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** Yeah, that's a good move.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Here, I'll do this one.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** This one's the prone move.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** It looks like a person on their all fours and with spikes.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** But if you look at it from a blurry perspective, it looks like a porcupine.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Yep.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** So it is prone.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** And then what is the other thing?

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** A fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** Yeah, prone, succeed at a fort save, or be blinded for 1d3 rounds.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Don't know what the DC of the fort save is, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:33]** That's the thing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Hmm.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Just make it something arbitrary, like 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Yeah, DC 14 or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** Yeah, well, oh wait, hold on.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Required ability checks to have a DC of 10.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** 10 plus one and a half, the attacks...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:46 - 00:42:05]** level um or the attacker's level or cr so one and a half times one is equal to one so like a 12 and 11 right well half you round up right you guys ran down you always run down 11 11 okay so we'll do 11 um fort save of 11

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:34]** not make it i rolled two on dice blinded okay so blinded i don't even know what blinded does i'll find it while you keep going i can okay can i put two effects on the same creature on roll 20 yeah yeah cool okay so it is blinded and prone great round huh blinded nice kidding rolu it is now your turn so you get to decide what you want to do yeah uh blinded by the way


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Flat-footed.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** Note, flat-footed.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:44]** Also, negative four penalty to strength and dex-based skill checks and opposed perception checks.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:48]** All checks and activities that rely on vision automatically fail.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:51]** Can't observe other creatures, yada, yada, yada.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** You treat all creatures as having total concealment, so a 50% missed chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Yeah.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** And then some other things about moving...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** What is flat-footed again?

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** You get a minus four to AC.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** Flat-footed is off the top.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Minus two penalty to AC.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** No reactions.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** No AOLs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Okay.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** All right.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:21]** So with that said, again, there are three K'Fox currently aligned against Rolou and Chak.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Okay.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** And it is Rolou's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Spoiler, Rolou is at one hit point.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:36]** So I think first he's going to say, Chuck, do you have those serums of healing?

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** I've got to need one.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** I'm going to need one.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:43]** And then he's going to take a free five foot step back.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** And I think he's just going to shoot.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** He's got his rifle out.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** He's just going to shoot at the one directly ahead of him because he wants to take him out.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Actually, he's going to take a free five foot step here.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Can I fit into the space cap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** Yeah, I'll allow that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Okay.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** He doesn't want to block any shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Okay, that's fair.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:09]** So you're going to kind of step back and diagonally to the left.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Up against a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Right into a corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Yeah, kind of cornering yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Unfortunately, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** But on the bright side, they can't flank you in that place.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Because you can't get across from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:24]** I'm also not in the path again for Thaddeus and Tormadin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** All right.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** And the question now, um, we haven't really, like I I'm digging through the survival rules.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** I don't like them and applied to, um, player on player.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:40]** So I think we should take that to discord and ask our paralegals for some advice.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:50]** In the meantime, I think we should stick to, you can either forfeit your move on the next round and stay with them, or you can stay where you're at and then use your own move separately.

**[00:44:50 - 00:45:12]** are we going for the next round or for that round it'll be on your next round well whatever yeah because it's i'm gonna say your next move okay so that we don't get confused with like round around because roly was at the bottom of the first round so it doesn't make it be good bullshit if i'm like oh no next round anyways uh wait what so your thought are you staying on him or are you staying in place i'm staying on him


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Okay, so Rolo and Choc both move back and forth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** No, I gotta stay on him.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Sorry, what did you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:27]** I was just thinking, I was like, maybe I could stay in there and tank for a minute, but no, I should stay on him if I'm gonna trap him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** I got this, guys!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** All right, so Rolo and Chak kind of move back to that corner.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Rolo, it is still your turn.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:38]** What is your move, your action, your standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:42]** He's going to shoot one of the K'foks right here in the middle.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Actually, this one in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Did you have your weapon out already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Yeah.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Okay.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:50]** I have the spear and the rifle out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** So you're shooting this one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Yeah, the one in the corner.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** That one has soft cover.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** What?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:01]** I mean, arguably it would by definition because you technically pick a point.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** No, because if you pick this point here, yeah, you cross through.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Anyways, I'm saying three.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** But it's dead.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** No, this one would give soft cover to that one.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Arguably.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Arguably.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** You're going to argue it?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** I'm going to say I'm not going to argue it this time.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** So you take a shot at K'fok.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** I'm going to label that one number two.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** Natural one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** No, it's ten total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** K-S-A-C or E-A-C?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:30]** That's going to be against... Does it matter, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** It's against E-A-C.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** That hits.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** That hits?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** Really?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** A 10 for EAC hits.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** Wow.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Wow.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** This is good to know.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Squishy, squishy.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:53]** I feel like he took a few steps back and probably stumbled and leaned into the wall because he's at one HP and just took a shot and somehow it hit.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** It's going to be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** Well, you got a wall of K'Fox to shoot at, so... I know.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Brought us out of a barn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** Like shooting a K'Fox in a barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Seven points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Oh, right.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** And what kind of weapon are you shooting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** An azimuth serpent laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Dang, that sounds vicious.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:31]** And this is a two-handed weapon, so you bump, you got it kind of low, and you pull that trigger, and this burst of fire damage comes out, and it hits and pierces, and you're not sure if it did anything, and then you just see it kind of boil from the inside as this thing rips open and falls apart.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** That's awesome.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** And that K'fok is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** Does it smell like the cart at the beginning of the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** Yes.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** That smells real familiar.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Kebab.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Amazing.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** All right.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** That is the end of round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Impressive.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:53]** Two down already and one nearly out for the count.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Thanks for the summary, that is.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Yeah, you're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** All right.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Moving on to round number two.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** And we're going to go back to the top with Chalk.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** What do you do, Chalk?

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** You lose your move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** No move.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** That's no move.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** No move.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:19]** You got it.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:28]** I'm trying to figure out what the turn economy is for me to not drop my rifle and also administer a healing serum.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** I don't think you can.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** Because if I put it away, I burn my standard action.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** I've already burned my move action.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** I think I have to drop it if I want to give him the serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** The stay mounted thing is a swift action.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Oh, that's fair.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:50]** If we use the mounting rules in the other from survival checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** Because as survival checks are written, basically I make a survival check to mount or unmount.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Anything else is just free.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:02]** I can use the creature's movement as my own, which is basically what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:08]** I've got survival open and it says... Is this survival?

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** It is survival.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** Page 149.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** To stay mounted, you still roll a DC, but the DC is really low.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** It's like a 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:20]** Yeah, but try to avoid falling off your mount when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Again, we'll have to read up on that more.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:27]** I'm typing it up right now to Discord so that our paralegals can let us know what their thoughts are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** So here's what I'm going to do to make sure I'm in.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:36]** I'm going to drop my rifle, which I will probably regret later, but that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:43]** My other question to you actually was going to be, you have the Leafan, the L-F-A-N.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:43 - 00:50:09]** um does that give you four arms is it so it's it's ambiguous because like he he i guess has like thicker tendrils but he would use like each vine would be a finger so like it's not it's not like he has arms as you would think of them he's got multiple chopsticks yeah okay so you're you are gonna drop it but you're gonna it's it's not like dropped it's it's just put away

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** I think I have to drop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:15]** Dropping a weapon is basically free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:23]** Because I need to pull out the healing serum and hit Cobb with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:27]** But you don't have a move action because of the current rules we have for riding mounted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Right.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Which is why I have to drop it to pull it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** And that's your turn.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Yeah.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Just pull out your CRM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** Yeah.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I can't even give it to him this turn.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Right.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:37]** No.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** I knew I was going to regret not staying on the ground.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** If I'd stayed on the ground, I would have been able to pull it out and give it to him.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:49]** Then I also would have been unarmed in front of two hungry K'faks, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Yeah.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Tiny little snack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** But, I mean, I think the stay mounted DC is five for a survival check.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** I mean, that would just kind of be a free action, right?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** And then could you administer then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:09]** The rules that we kind of discussed in the last few episodes have been he either forfeits his move.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** And again, I'm literally typing it up as we speak to the paralegals.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:17]** We can change this in due time in this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:23]** Yeah, I think for this, until we get some feedback from the firm, I think this is kind of what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** It kind of sucks, but hey, it is what it is.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Don't fail me, the firm.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** And it's dead.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** So now we're moving on to Thaddeus.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** All right.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:40]** Thaddeus is going to shoot the one that's right.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Yeah.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Yeah.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Where is right now?

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** Yeah.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:48]** Now is like north west, northwest or whatever it's called.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Yeah.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** North, northwest.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** There was a wall of three fox.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** He's he's going behind door number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** All right, here we go.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** 20 to hit.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** I'm guessing that hits, Kevin.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Oh, not a natural 20.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** I was like, dang.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** No, it wasn't a natural 20.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** And you're shooting your Venom caster?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Yeah, I'm going to shoot the Venom caster.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** There's no Venom in it.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Normal charge.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:21]** And that's a... Oh, Kelly looks excited.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:28]** I think it gave me... It's Roll20's fault.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Alright, here we go.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Now, this is...

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Eight damage, eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Suck on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** You rolled a natural eight for a D8?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** I did, I did.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Beautiful.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** And I think you guys are so good this round.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** Thaddeus, you're just confident as shit.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** You're just like, I got this.

**[00:52:49 - 00:53:01]** Pull out your Venom Caster, pull the trigger, and you just peg this thing right in the chest, and it just pierces in, and this thing falls forward, collapses onto the ground, and it is dead immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Lucky shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Roland shakes it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Yes, technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:13]** That's a circular of mine of these K'afaks in a row, so, you know, you need to wake up.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Would you like some tea or coffee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** Well, now it's K'afak number one's turn, and K'afak number one is dead.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:24]** So moving on to the next K'Fox.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** K'Fox number five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** You know what I really would love to see, Kevin?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** K'Fox number five?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** What about the blind one?

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** Could you X out the one that just died?

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** I want to see it.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Oh, yes, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** X that one out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** There's a fifth K'fok?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** That's right.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:43]** Or did he just name them K'fok?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Yeah, they're arbitrary.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Nope.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** There is a fifth K'fok.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Do we need to censor those?

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** That has to be the title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** K'fok.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** K'fok me.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** That would be great, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:04]** I actually, I did play K'fok number five last round, and this turn, it is going to come out.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** What?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:14]** And you see it, like it bursts out the bottom of this ziggurat and charges right for Rolu.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Hold on, man.
