**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** That's all I do.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** And I'm a slow reader.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** So I read it twice before I start.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** And then once while I'm saying it.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** God damn it.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Kelly, you're here too?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Ah, no.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** Oh, whoa.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** I just appeared in like John's office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:43]** That was the sound of Kelly spilling his beer on me.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** That never happened.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** We don't want to make... Wait, did that spill, right?

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Okay, cool.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Oh, Christ.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** It's all good.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** All right, good.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** Never mind.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** Don't make me sound like some kind of psycho.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I'm not like that.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** No, it was clearly an accident.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** He's joking.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** That didn't happen, people.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** I just all of a sudden, like...

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** peaked into existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** Kelly retains all his fluids at all times.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** He does.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** And Kev was just joshing.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** It's fine.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** He was just joshing with us.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** I don't even know what that means.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** But it's productive.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Sorry, you sidetracked me.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** I was like talking about my son.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Welcome back.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** How amazing he is.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** I'm a Californian.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** This is a funny one.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** This is funny.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** This is funny things that my son says.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** So we flew to California.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** We left Maryland at 4 a.m.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** He didn't sleep at all on the plane.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:35]** He only actually slept like 30 minutes in the car ride from LA to Pasadena.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:40]** And then he was awake the rest of the day until 7 p.m.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** California time.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** So I don't even know the math on that.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** That's a lot of time.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** It's a lot of time.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Well, there's also a three-hour time change in there.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** So it's technically like 1 a.m.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** till 7 p.m.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:03:50 - 00:04:11]** yeah it's 10 p.m pure time yeah poor kid anyways he actually slept fine that night and he woke up at 4 a.m and he said i pooped very clear i was like okay good that's like kevin i pooped kevin

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** Dada, I wake, I pooped.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Thank you for informing me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** But in the potty, in his diaper, in his short, like what's the context for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** He was asleep.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** He woke himself up.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** By pooing.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** That's like me.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** We're getting there.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Me too again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** At least now I know we share one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** I don't remember the last time I pooped myself.

**[00:04:37 - 00:05:02]** i don't remember the last i don't think i can actually remember any time that i put myself awake that's because you were asleep a lot long time ago yeah speaking of jet lag though uh kelly you were just recently traveling around the world and john traveled to scotland that's my that's my scottish accent inland yep that was that was dead on that's how everyone talked scotland scotland

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:08]** You sound like a British person saying Scotland's a part of Britain, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** Yeah.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Well, you sound like an English person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Sorry.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Kelly, where did you go?

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:16]** I went to various parts of Spain and Italy and France and the Mediterranean areas.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** It was pretty cool.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:22]** I drove around Portofino, Italy, and also pretended to be a pirate in Ibiza.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** It was pretty dope.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** And hung out with some French people in Tulum.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Anyway, just stuff like that.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** I was on a cruise.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Yeah.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** Good time.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** The way Kelly describes it, he could be describing anything.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** He's like, yeah, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** I don't talk a lot about the details of things that I do, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:39]** ah yeah that's why i didn't want to make it awkward yeah that's really that's rude kelly why would you even do that dude that's so rude i've just i'm sorry jeremy and jeff and aiden and various other people from all of you none of you are invited and dawn dawn yeah yeah that's right well i'll zoom it for you it's okay i'm not invited either


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** But you're specifically invited.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** I didn't get an invite.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Well, we haven't sent out the invites yet.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** I mean, we just got back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** I wouldn't be surprised if Will was on a list.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Unable to... Yeah, he's invited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** Will is always on some list, so it's fine.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** The point is that my fiance and I are going to get married in the UK.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** And we went on a little trip to see which venues.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:15]** We made a short list of manors and estates and even one full castle.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** And we went to see what they actually look like.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** And we picked one in Scotland that we're going to get married at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** What dictates a manor or an estate or a castle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** You know, that's a good question.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** And I don't know the answer to that.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** But I will say that there's one place that we went.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** You can look it up.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** It's called Carlton Towers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** It's where they film.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** It's not the place that we chose.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** It's beautiful on the outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:50]** The inside is a little... I don't want to say anything negative per se.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** It's beautiful inside.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** We didn't choose it, though.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** We felt like it wasn't quite the ambiance that we were looking for.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** But it is incredible.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:08]** And we actually found out that the Duke of Norfolk's brother lives there in a separate part, like in a separate wing.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Like his family lives there.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:17]** And so they apparently are, you know, like, there when, like, weddings and things go on.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** They're royalty.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** They're literal royalty.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** They're in the line of succession.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:26]** Yeah, like, they're the second highest dukeship in all of, like, the Duke of Norfolk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:32]** If she hits the fan and the royal family is, like, decimated by some act of God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** This is the Duke of Norfolk?

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Norfolk.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Yes, of Norfolk, Virginia.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** Yes.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** It's pronounced Norfolk.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Norfolk.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Here it is.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Because it's pre-1776.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Norbeep.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** Your beep.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** You're from Norbeep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** To your question, Benny, I think it's just size.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** The place that we went to calls itself an estate.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Some places were like halls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** But they're really, really big halls.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** You know, there's several halls put together.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:17]** From what I'm reading on the internet, it says that typically built with strong fortifications as castles were, many manor houses were fortified, which required a royal license to crenellate?

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Crennellate?

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, there's often walls or ditches.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** So I feel like there's a lot more to a manor and estate versus a castle.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** I don't know.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** Anyways.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Lord of the Manor.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** They have so many there.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** It's a very common enterprise.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** Well, speaking of castles... What?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** And fiefdoms?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Fiefdoms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:46]** Okay, I don't get why... I don't think you're using fiefdom correctly.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Honestly.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** Is that what they say?

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** A fief is like a collection of land that you lease out to people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:59]** An area over which someone exercises control as or in the matter of feudal lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** I know, but is that actually how Cathac Depot is structured?

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** So they're fiefdoms.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Is Kevark Depot a feudal society?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Well, that's what I'm asking, because it is a feudal thing.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** The water dealer rules all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Yeah, the water dealer has his territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** He's the feudal lord.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** And he leases out the other ones for an exchange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:24]** The Carnival Hotel, which I said was like Circus Circus, is a resort run by a Soki named Zelp and her two children, Neelich and Blit.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** Yeah, there's the other ones too.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** I can get into it more.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** But yes, each of them kind of have a ruler.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** or an owner, do they pay tribute?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** Yeah, they must do, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Wait, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** I also put some flavor in there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:45]** This is a strange thing to say in a modern context, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** They're saying it horribly.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** Super futural.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Fiftum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Fiftum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Fiftum.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** That's the worst way of... Fiftum.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Yanny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:03]** Okay, well, it's from the Latin, which no one knows how to pronounce, so really there's no correct pronunciation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** I'm going to go with Fife, like Barney.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** Fife.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Yeah, Johnny Fife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** I think it's more... The Latin is feudum.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** So like feudalism.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Fiefdom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Fief.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:21]** Join us again next week when I try to use another word that's out of context and inappropriately said.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** That's our show.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Thanks, everyone.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** And that's game.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Cool.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Well, I think it's time.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** Let's play.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** It's time to play.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** Here we go.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:41]** Last time, Varya13 tells you about the transponder codes and that they think they can locate the wreckage of the Stellar Flare with some assistance.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:49]** Riddle pays you 500 credits as promised, and Michael marks up a map of Gavok Depot showing you where the True Warrior is regular.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** That one I actually had to look up too.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Regular is a verb, right?

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** Am I using that right or is that inappropriate?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** Tell me on Twitter and Discord.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:05]** You decide to call ahead and then you go to the Motel 6 at Ixamander's Throne.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** You buy some wares from a very pleasant Nagaji at the fuel dump.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Sporting is a good store.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Then you rest up.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** During the night, there are some drunk idiots that mistakenly pound on your door instead of somebody else's.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:25]** Thaddeus spends that time listening to a full set of messages between Chir and Rolu.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** Then you guys eat breakfast and head back to Junker's Delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Did we miss anything?

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** I don't think so.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** I don't know if I'd describe the snake guy as pleasant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** I got some puffatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** He was fine, but he wouldn't give us any deals.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** He was very pleasant.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** He gave us a good deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** I got an extra grenade.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** I got 10%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** All right.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:53]** I guess we all got 10% off, but apparently my amount of healing serums is reduced that I can get.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:59]** You said instead of seven, I just can't five now instead.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Oh, you're just kidding.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** I said four.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** I let's be super generous.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** You special ordered them, but only four of them came in the next morning.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** Um, you were able to pick them up on your way down to get breakfast.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Uh,

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:15]** The thing is, you guys can't all have 500 healing serums.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** They're really small, Kevin.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Portable.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Are they?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Actually, I don't know.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Don't look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Five bulk a piece?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Each one is like one bulk.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** All right.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:36]** Well, anyway, so that means I have five in total that I bought from him because there are four on special order and one that he had in stock.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Okay, cool.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Five.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** All right.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** So now what is the total in the group now?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** No.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** No.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** A very healthy amount, you might say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Tormeus, two.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** Thaddeus has five now.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Rolo has four.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Check, you have one?

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** I have none.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Y'all bought them all.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** I feel like we shouldn't tell Kevin because I don't want him to know who has what.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:07]** If only there was a mechanism for Kev to look at what we have on our character sheets.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** I don't like sitting across from Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I don't trust any of you.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Cool.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** So you guys get back to Junkers Delight.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:18]** You go in the back alley and you knock on the door and do the special knock.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Open up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Hello?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Nothing happens.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** Did they say any word that they would be out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** I sort of half thought this was a bad idea to leave that android alone.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Or not with us, I should say.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Let's break down the door.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** Oh, they're not here.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Come on, Rolo, together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:53]** As you back up, as you look right at your shoulder, Michael actually kind of looks both ways.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** You see him kind of cross at the end of the alleyway, and you see him look both ways before ducking into the alleyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** He's good at directions.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** He makes sure he looks both ways across the street.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Very safe.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Yeah, very safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** he comes back and he's like, Oh, Hey, Hey guys.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Uh, you made it back.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Good.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** And he, he tells you, he did have a run in with a couple of true warriors out here.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Are you okay?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:22]** No, no, they, yeah, they, I was able to convince them that I chased you guys out of the car yards and I've been searching for you ever since.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** Uh, and I, and I told him that I know that you're so he's inside and I've, I've got an eye on this building.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** So like, you know, I, I was just trying to like,

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Lead them in the wrong direction.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** A well-played deception.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** And then he pulls out a key and actually unlocks the door.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** Riddle trusts him enough to... You guys all go inside.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** Oh.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:47]** Riddle's actually relaxing on a comfy chair opposite side of the room.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** And Vari13 works at a computer terminal.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** As you guys come in, Vari greets you.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:59]** And since you guys came back and you did talk about helping...

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:03]** I'm very glad that you decided my cause is of interest to you.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:13]** Exhausted as I was from my travails in the car yards, I have nevertheless worked all night examining the Stellar Flare's transponder code.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** I even tried sending a message to the starship, but alas...

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** I received no reply.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:35]** However, Vi-13, with a smile, gestures at the computer, I believe I can pinpoint the Stomach Flayer's location with reasonable accuracy, if only you would be so gracious to lend me a hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** Chuck, I think this is your wheelhouse, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Yeah, what can I do to help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** So she's sorry.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** They step out of their chair.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:50]** Chalk hops up, spins around, swings over to the computer, starts typing away.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Go ahead and give me a DC.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:53]** Sorry.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Give me a computer's check.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** The DC is for me to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:00]** I see what you did there.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** It's a 17.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** It's DC 17, right?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** It's DC 16 and a half, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** It's not.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** You actually failed.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** So what would have taken you only an hour is actually going to take you almost three.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** But you do manage to get there.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** It is now, though, peak time of the day.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** It's starting to get hot.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:27]** But you actually do know at least a location for where to go.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** You successfully triangulate the transponder location.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:36]** And Riddle actually pulls out some maps of Kefauk Depot and the surrounding area.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:41]** And you guys compare to the information you gave her.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:49]** Turns out the Stellar Flare's wreckage lies in the middle of the oldest crashed starships on the planet.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:54]** A large area outside of Kefauk Depot called the Outer Junk Fields.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:59]** And when Riddle realizes this, she shakes her head.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** I'm sorry, Varya.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** But the Outer Junk Fields, they're a death trap.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:11]** Have been ever since a bunch of space goblins and Akestis moved in there.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** They turn that place into like a war zone.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:17]** They're constantly trying to kill each other and anybody else who comes around.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** I'm sorry, that's too dangerous.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** You can't go.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Varya 13 objects.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** No, nonsense.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** We've got some of the bravest and most clever guides right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** Check looks around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:39]** It's just like, yeah, totally assuming we're going to go home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** Sorry, is that us?

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** I'm not picking up on it.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:49]** And even Riddle kind of catches on and then reluctantly confesses to Bowery that you guys aren't technically her employees.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** You're simply friendly visitors.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** And she actually did throw up her fingers.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** And she said that, you know, air quotes, who helped you out of a jam.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** And although she did pay you to recover the android.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:09]** And that's when Vahri kind of breaks in and says, well, money is no object.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:12]** Considering the importance of the Stella Flores research.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** Riddle looks and nods at each of you.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** So, uh, what do you say?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Sounds like there might be some hazard pay?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Maybe it's worth your time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** May we discuss this on our own for a moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** So, wait, is this an optional side quest, Kevin?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Or is this like to complete?

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Oh, no, this isn't an optional side quest.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:37]** I was going to say, if we take this on, it's going to be like an extra month of episodes or two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** I mean, we're going to see 15 months of episodes anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Yeah, yeah, two months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** That's my job.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** Is this part of the actual AP?

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Yeah, this is part of the AP.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** That's true.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** So wait, but like, I thought we were supposed to get this dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Yeah.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** I don't know when we're going to get, uh, what's his name again?

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** We've been doing this ship thing for so long.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** We don't even know.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Yeah.

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** Yeah.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** That's what I want to know.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** I don't know.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Five months from now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** Are you asking me?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Riddle, have you been in any movements?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** I thought we were going to stick to the plan, guys.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:14]** I really hope Dotrulu happens to be in the same place.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Kevin.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Who is this Kevin?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** Thaddeus speaks to the wall.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** I think Kevin is his deity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** All praise Kevin.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Kevin.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** If I had to guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Are we supposed to go on this thing?

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I mean, is there an alternative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** There's always an alternative.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** Real talk.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:45]** Let's remember that our boss wants us to restore order to Capac Depot, meaning take out Dotrulu.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** This is an extra thing.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** We'll help our crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** Okay.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:58]** From a metagaming perspective, if Dotrulu is the big bad, we have to level up before we can get to him.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:03]** From an RP perspective, it's... I'll do this in character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** So, we need to go after this Dotrulu guy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:12]** He seems to be leading whatever's going on around here.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:17]** They seem pretty interested in what's going on with Vary 13 and this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** Precisely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:26]** If we get to it first, that could be the leverage we need to get rid of these K'foks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** Hmm.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** That is sensible.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** That's sensible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** I see your reasoning, Chuck.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** I just don't know if it's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** We don't know how much while there is for them to make it worth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** He turns to very 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** How much are we talking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:54]** I could probably offer you 1500 credits apiece.

**[00:21:55 - 00:22:01]** And if that's not enough for you, I might be able to give you a percent of the windfall.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** I'm sure this research will lead to something massive.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:13]** And I'm only interested in learning what that actually is and not so much in marketing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** I'll tell you what I'll do it for $2,000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Go ahead and roll a diplomacy check for me.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** $27,000.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** All right.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** They increase the stake to 35%.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:29]** They tell you that they will give you everything they have on them, and that's only 8,000 credits total.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** So you guys can split that amongst yourselves.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:36]** But they do promise that they can get you more in the future.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** They have resources.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** I mean, if I'm going to risk my neck...

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** I expect to be paid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Thank you.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** The percentage of the outcome, whatever income is generated from it, I think is good.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** I think our captain will be pleased with that.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** It's a nice touch.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:08]** Look, and I think Willow turns to Treme and Jack and Thaddeus and says, it seems like the true warriors were watching Farway 13 from the beginning.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** So it...

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:16]** As Tuchak's point, wherever this leads will likely lead to the true warriors.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** So we should be on our guard.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** They did find us, remember, in the car yachts.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** All right, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** Okay, so you guys, we're in.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Great.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Rolo puts all of his hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** We need a team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Team huddle.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** We need all of our hands in the center.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Check.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** That's your vines included.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** 10.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** 12 sets of hands.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** Thaddeus, you need to do this.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** 14.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** You need to put your hand in, Thaddeus.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Riddle only puts like one hand because they...

**[00:23:48 - 00:24:08]** that's like one little claw all right one finger right on top of rollers before you guys head out uh do you go ahead give me a life science check um we'll talk about the space goblins and the kesties yeah that's what i was thinking good look i don't have life science

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** 17.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** 13.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** All right.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Cool.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:20]** So just so you know, space goblins are small, bulbous-headed, green-skinned humanoids.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:25]** They're instinctive tinkerers, and they craft weapons and other equipment out of junk.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** Fun fact about them, they have the skill Tinker.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:37]** So as a move action, a space goblin junker can remove the penalties associated with a broken condition.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** from a single piece of equipment until the start of their next journey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** That's cool.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:49]** If you would like to learn more about space goblins, you can listen to book one of The Threefold Conspiracy, which you can listen to and we'll save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** We did run into a few there.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** We did.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** You can also listen to Akashji's.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** There was an Akashji in book two.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:02]** And so Akestis are a red, scaly, lizard-like humanoid native to Akitan.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:13]** They have tumultuous life cycles as young Akestis who don't mate and transform turn into riveners, losing their ability to reason while radically increasing in size and muscle mass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** Why don't we get a frog to help us out?

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:17]** He's not far away.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** I mean, like, the arena's right over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** He's probably too busy.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** And also, Rourke wasn't... But he's in a cash dig.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** Four random pirates to convince him.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:31]** He was experimented on by the Greys.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Yeah, right now he's a tiny creature.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Spoiler.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** I'm just saying.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Dude, I didn't know that.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Dang it.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** We talked about that hit.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:45]** So as a contender in the arena, he is a small creature because he's actually fighting a Yosuke the same size.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** I just want Hrog to come along.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** We know he's not going to die because we've run into him in the threefold conspiracy, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Just catch him like a Pokemon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, I want Hrog to come.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** I'm not joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Cool.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Also for your life science check.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Is Michael coming with us?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Let's just get the whole gang back together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** We'll get Michael.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** We'll get Riddle to come.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** It'll be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:15]** So also from your life science check, you learn that Akeshi's sometimes have the ability to squirt blood once per day as a move action.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:20]** And Akeshi can squirt blood from one of their eyes at a foe within 30 feet, making a ranged attack.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:30]** A successful hit grants the next ally who attacks the foe the benefit of harrying fire, which in this sense, you would be the foe.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** and their ally would be the enemies.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** Right.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** As for Michael, you guys could ask him.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** Interested in heading out to the outer junk fields?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** What was it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** Junk fields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Outer junk fields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** I think I should stay here.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** I can help protect Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** You got to keep up appearances with the true warriors and keep this place safe.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** I think that's the voice I used for.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** I don't know.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Is everyone ready to go?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** No time like the present.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Give me a culture check as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Culture, you say?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** Now, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Is it like recall knowledge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Just a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** There's recall knowledge and there's like decipher writing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Are they all under culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** Those are only two things you can do for culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Then I guess it would be recall knowledge.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** 24.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Yeah, I got a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** I got a 24.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** I don't have culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Thaddeus has no culture.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** We have no culture.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** We already know that Thaddeus.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Thanks, sir.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I read the wrong thing.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** I have a 21.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** I have a 7 culture.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Okay.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Plus 7 culture.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** So 21 and a 23, you said?

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** 26.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** 26.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** So with that, I'll tell you that...

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:57]** there are the space goblins that are in, uh, the outer junk fields are known to, um, almost praise salvaging junk.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:01]** It's, it's almost like a religion to them.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:10]** Um, and then the Akestis, you recently heard, uh, that they were cast out, um, from their families for criminal activities.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:17]** And they want like a group of Akestis joined together in the outer junk fields to create almost like a Akesti gang.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Oh, God.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** These Akeshdis, like, how big are they?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Are they just young Akeshdis?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** The small type?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** He asks whoever the hell mentioned.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Because the Riveners are, like, mad, right?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** Yeah, because we do not... I mean, a group of Riveners is not going to be fun.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** So... Well, Kevin...

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** How old are they?

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Tell us more.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Tell us more about these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** At the mention of Riveners, Kev got the biggest grin.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Yeah, it's really weird.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** And I'm really...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** I'll tell you more at the end of the adventure.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:57]** If you're curious, you could buy the book and read through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** That's what I do every time I play a campaign.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Buy someone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:09]** I'm only like 80% through threefold, so once I finish that, I'll pick up Junkers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:18]** Riddle and Michael intend to stay behind, but Vari13 insists on joining you.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:39]** oh yes so you move um through fox depot you you're very careful about not running into any true warriors and you make your way to the entrance to an area called the rust district so just one thing the rust rust district district district

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Just talk about the outer junk fields.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:53]** Compared to the car yards with its clearly delineated paths, the outer junk yard form a maze of barely visible trails through rolling mounds of junk and huge pieces of starship wreckage.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** But you have triangulated the stellar flare's location from the transponder signal.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:05]** But you must first navigate your way through the outer junk fields and its dangers on foot.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** But to reach the outer junk fields... Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Can we not go on foot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:15]** You could try to fly, but nothing can fly in Kefauk Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Can we get a Hummer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** Yeah, if you got 40,000 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Can we rent one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** If you have 3,000 credits.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Yeah, we don't have enough.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** Can we rent a pickup?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Yeah, no.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:33]** 20 bucks a day?

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** I'm going to say you're going to have to walk on foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** We'll walk on foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** So to reach the Outer Junk Fields, you pass through the Rust District.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** It's a safe section of rubbish outside of Kefauk Depot.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:52]** Junk tour guides have actually curated the Rust District into almost a theme park experience for less adventurous tourists.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Junk coaster, carnival booths.

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:01]** Other than that, it's very similar to the car yards, but the Rust District doesn't suffer from those pesky Kefauks.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** Riddle did tell you before you left...

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:14]** yeah when you when you get to the uh the gateway of refrigerators that's the border to the outer junkyards

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:41]** Um, so you guys walk through the rust district and you do find a, you know, walls of junk with large, uh, archway of refrigerators along the way you passed a small, uh, lake of disposable plastic containers, uh, warped panes of transparent aluminum as tall as trees and tunnels made out of electronic games or out of a tunnel of outdated electronic games.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Um,

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:46]** A lot of these installations seem more like modern art than just heaps of trash.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:54]** And on that big archway made up of refrigerators, you do see a sign saying, thank you for visiting the rest of the district.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** Okay.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** You guys ready to roll?

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Yeah.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** Are we going to stop, look through some junk piles for some old Tamagotchis or, you know, Casio golf?

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** It's up to you.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** No?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Football?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** No?

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Tetris?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** NBA jams.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** Yo.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** He's on fire!

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:26]** yeah amazing he's heating up go ahead and roll uh one person roll a survival check uh i am untrained i mean i have zero plus four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** I think that's Kelly.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** I rolled 24.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** I think that should be fine.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** 24?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** You mean you got a natural 20?

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I got a natural 20.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Cool, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Okay, good.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** So we live.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:44]** You passed your DC check, or your survival check.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** Wait, does anything special happen because I got a natural 20 in survival?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Yeah, what is he rolling survival for?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:56]** Natural 20s don't give you anything special on skill checks.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** Are there any other questions you want to ask that are GM-specific?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** What was he doing, though?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** Was he orienting?

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Was he trying to see, like, tracks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** He was probably going to open up the desert.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Orienteering, is that the word?

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Yeah.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** Yeah, what do we see past that arch?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:26]** While passing through unfamiliar terrain, each time you move close to a natural hazard, such as quicksand or patches of poisonous atmosphere, you can use survival to keep from getting lost or to notice or to avoid a hazard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:30]** Great, so you didn't get lost.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:38]** Okay, so you come to an area where swaths of trash exist.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** have been pushed away to reveal pitted red earth.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:54]** Tiny bits of plastic float in pools of filthy standing water that surround a dark, dry hole that is 10 feet in diameter and an unknown depth.

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:00]** While there, you guys do... Okay, let me actually put you on the map.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** Yeah, I was like, ooh, let's see some map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** I'm excited.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Ooh, look at this.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Classic.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** There's like a Sarlacc pit in the middle or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Classic Sarlacc pit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** Looks like it's surrounded by amoeba-shaped sand pits or something.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** It's like a golf course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:22]** It's definitely more of a golf course than a solid pit.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** It's just a black hole in the middle.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:27]** And then there are bulbs.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** What is the term?

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** I don't know what to describe it.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** There's supposed to be ponds.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** Those are the standing liquid I was talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Liquid and plastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Trash.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** Welcome to the out-of-jarkey fields.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** A bunch of Starbucks straws.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:55]** You do notice a tiny creature, like a rat-like creature, and we're talking not Yosuke, but actual rat, drinking from one of the puddles.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** Go ahead, everybody roll me Perception.

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** Gross.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Very gross.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Not enough.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Probably not enough.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** 11.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** I got a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** I got an eight.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** 18.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:15]** So you all notice that the creature just vanishes.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:37]** gone um but chalk and kelly sorry that is your name in the game is cat that is um all good the two of you actually see um almost like a red rope lash out and snatch this creature and drag it back into the hole


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** Wait, into the watery thing?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** Or that sarlacc pit looking black hole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** It was drinking from one of the water ponds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** It's like drinking from this pond, right?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Random.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** A red rope shot out of the black hole, grabbed it and sucked it in.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Okay.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:03]** Uh, Thaddeus tells everyone, uh, that pit right there has something in it.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** It just grabbed that rat.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Stay far away.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:12]** It looks like it can at least reach out 10, at least 10 feet, maybe further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:15]** So I'm going to, and before you can, so go ahead, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:22]** Chuck is going to step over and grab a piece of trash and throw it into one of the ponds just to see.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** That's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Oh, one of the ponds.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Okay.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** So the water splashes a little bit and then everything is still.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:38]** And just out of pure curiosity, Vari 13 moves forward.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Vari, no.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Hey, Vari.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** That's when a Thesteran toad

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** What?

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:54]** Climbs out from the hole.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** And says, that's Wednesday, my dudes.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** And lashes out at Vare 13.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** How dare you roll furnished here?

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Oh, man.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** Don't need your Toad behavior today, Toad.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** That's kind of cute.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Nine.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Nine for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Eleven for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** Eight for Rolo.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** I got a 15.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** 15.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:27]** 15 plus one for Vahri.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** 14 for Vahri.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Does it grab her?

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:34]** What is your bonus to make?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:59]** uh plus one i have a plus one new initiative okay all right so you were asking it's the faster on faster toad they're called faster to i like that is making an attack and got a natural one

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Critical fail.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Dude, no way.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Really?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** A natural one.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Sorry.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** I forget what critical fails happen.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** They happen on a natural one.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Yeah, but are we using the deck?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** We can use the deck.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Crack it open.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** You want to just draw a card out?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Which one's which?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Since you're right next to each other and all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** Yeah, just probably shuffle.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** You can just cut to a card.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Pull this card.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** What are the symbols?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Do I use the sword?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:55]** it should be yeah it should be uh either like melee or is it a melee attack or yeah sorry kinetic energy or spell there's four yeah the last one is if the type aligns with the extreme then you can use the extreme version oh i see it's gonna okay re-roll the attack against your original target if the attack hits it's a critical hit but you are sickened for three d four rounds

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Yeah, that's what it says.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** That sounds like a devil's bargain of sorts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** That does.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** So what does it say to redo?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Reroll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** If it rerolls and it hits.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** And that hits.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:13]** And if you hit, then it's a critical hit, but then you're sickened for three rounds.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Jeez.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** So there's a critical hit on Vahri 13, but you're sickened for three rounds.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** That's a deal that I will take.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** I am sickened.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Freaking thing.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** So you just crit on Vahri?

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** I just crit on Vahri.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Kind of a crit.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Nobody's excited about this?

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:32]** No.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** No.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** No.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** Dude, I don't want our main guide to go down, dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Right.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** That's how we're getting paid, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:45]** So that's... D4 plus two.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Counterpoint.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** We are pirates.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:53]** And they did say that they have 8,000 credits on their version.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** If she dies, we're taking the money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:02]** So for that crit, I rolled two max damages.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Oh my god, dude.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** So that's eight plus four.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Are they okay?

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** And they are now grappled.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Oh!

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** With that, let me take the damage off.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:23]** And then also, remember, you take a minus two penalty to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** You applied your negative two to your attack roll already?

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Say again?

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** You're sickened for the next three rounds.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** So it's a total of eight instead of 12.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** No, I don't think... I think it's a critical hit as normal.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Then you are sickened.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** Okay, so then... Boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Vari's still alive.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** But they hit the ground.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** They are now grappled.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** And they go blank.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** When they reopen their eyes...

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** They find themselves sprinting down a hallway.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:01]** They turn a corner and they see two people climbing into an escape pod.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Hurry, Vari!

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Just go.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** I will get the next one.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:11]** The others reluctantly obey and close the escape pod door.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Swoosh!

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:19]** A bright flash shines through the escape pod isolation door portal.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** The light above the door goes from flashing yellow to solid red.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** There are only two escape pods left.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** Vari looks back around the corner, out of curiosity.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Don't run.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** I just want you to give me what I want.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** They hear this voice echoing in their heads.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:51]** They grip the box tighter, and as darkness bleeds down the hallway, cutting through that darkness, Vahri sees two pitch black eyes.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** And we'll come back to combat.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** Vahri's grappled.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Termay, it is your turn.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Oh man, you're killing me with this.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** Uh, yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** I want to talk about it.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** Sorry, sorry.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:18]** So, Termay's gonna step up a little bit and take a shot with his tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Boom.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Boom.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I think that's 30.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Uh, 16.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** 16 to hit.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** That's a hit.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Nice.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** So, 1d6.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Nice.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Max damage, six.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Nice.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Way to go.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Dang.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Get it.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Mental math there.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Boom.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** So you took out... Sorry, you didn't take out.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** I already had it out, my semi-auto pistol.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** No, I meant like damage-wise.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** You take good damage out of them.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:55]** And it is now Vari 13's turn.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** They're pinned, actually.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** Grappled or pinned is 10 plus the grappler's KAC.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Okay.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** That's pretty high.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** So they are still pinned.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** So you cannot move.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Nope.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** So they are pin pinned.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Pin, pin, pin, pin.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** My wife makes fun of me because I say pin, pin, and pin.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:19]** I can't hear the difference between pin and pin.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Pen and pin?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Pen, pin, peen and pin?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** P-E-N and P-I-N?

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** They sound the same to me.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Eh and eh.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:31]** They can take verbal and mental actions such as spellcasting.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Okay.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Okay.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:35]** So Vahri has no spellcasting abilities.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** So let's move on.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** Chuck, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Oh, brother.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:45]** Chalk is going to... He's going to survey the situation.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:51]** Does this Thastron frog look similar to the Thastron K'vok?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:04]** This is definitely a lizard-like creature versus the other thing was a... Thastortoads are a tailless lizard mutated by centuries of contact with Thastron.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:13]** Plates of Thastron grow on their backs as a form of protection, though it makes them the target of uneducated hunters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** And is there any indication that they are radioactive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** No.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Cool.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** You don't have life science, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:47]** i don't i don't have life science i was just assuming it might it might appear that way based on fighting uh that's drunk and fuck but that's cool jock is gonna hop down uh move forward and he's gonna pull out his hunting rifle that's your full turn matter of fact or do you have a bonus attack uh yeah that's base attack that's my full turn i do not have a base attack bonus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** All right.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:56]** Now that you've moved up, it is this Thaster Toad's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** This?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** Oh, because there's another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** There's two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Oh, dude.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Did you expect, yo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Oh, wait, wait.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** I do have a basic attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** Yeah, dude, you're level two.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** So ignore this one.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** You're not allowed to hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** You can hit this one, though.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Yeah, I'm going to fire at that.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** All right.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** That is 16.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** 16 to hit hits.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** 16 to hit hits.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** That's a D10.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** I need a D8.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** That is four piercing damage.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** And now I'm done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** And what did we say this toad was sickened?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Was that what we said?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Yeah.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Yeah, sickened for three rounds.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** And what does sickened do again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:48]** Minus two to attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, ability checks.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Weapon damage rolls.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Saving throws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** Yeah, saving throws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Nothing to KAC or ESC, right?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Nope.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** No.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** No.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Cool.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:29]** man this is fun now that chalk's taking their turn uh the second thaster toad climbs out and it's gonna move closer to chalk and is gonna use tongue to attack chalk over here it's a nine it's ineffective for 18 to hit never mind does an 18 hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Yeah, and 18 hits.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** We're level two, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Plus nine?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Jeez.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** What's your KAC plus eight?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** 22.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** KAC plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** 18.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** So I did not... Oh, I did hit.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** That matches that, right?

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Yeah.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** So you are... KAC plus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** It's a weird number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** They're good at this stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** That's for a maneuver.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Yeah, that's for a combat maneuver.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Great.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Well, we have two party members grappled.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** I think I'm just going to leave.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** I'm not done there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** Are they pinned or are they grappled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:28]** pinned can you make up pinned okay so penned or pinned so so chalk is pinned no i'm penned he's working on my biography i'm super confused i was penned safari was pinned chalk is grappled got it are we clear got it

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** That was only one on the dice for a total of three.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Now double check that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** Three what?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** So you took three points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Oh, okay.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Just roll depressed, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:45]** We're just trying to find a way to get... Oh, how exciting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:50]** You notice Chuck throw up in his mouth because he hates slimy stuff.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Oh, dude.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Yeah.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** Hang on, let me roll constitution to see if he lets it out or swallows it back down.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** Oh, 16.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** He swallows it back.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Ew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Amazing.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** The bile comes back down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Amazing.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** So now that is the end of Thastor Toad's turn.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** And it is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:19]** Thaddeus is going to do a life science check and see if they have any particular weaknesses.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** He only rolls a 9, though.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** So I'm wondering if that helps.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** Maybe to find out one thing about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** You rolled a total 9?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Yeah, for life science.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Total 9.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:49]** you don't know anything from that nothing at all all right well he's going to take a full action that's your whole turn it's going to take i can still take a full action right actually yeah you said your full turn sweet he's gonna like uh fire his venom caster twice so this is not a poison that he has added

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Uh, the one that like tongue check.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** It sounds kind of weird.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** So we can't do that now.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** I mean, whatever you're into is fine, but it still sounds weird.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** That is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:10]** And, and, um, just rules wise, since far 13 is pinned, um, they do not provide soft cover.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** So you have a, you have a clear shot at both asterisks.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Oh, fantastic.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** I'm pretty sure.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Is that, does anybody agree to that?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Is there an argument?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** No, no.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Ah,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** My goodness.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** I don't think Thaddeus is going to hit in either case.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** She rolled a four and a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Oh, my God, dude.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** I know.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Sad day.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** So you fire twice and miss.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Yep.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Oh, no.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** You are so good at being a weapons officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** That's fine.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** I've killed many things with my weapons, Kevin.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Many of your little NPCs.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Right.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** Roller, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** It's your turn.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Oh, man.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:50]** Thanius, I'm surprised that you don't know more about these creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** I have to say, I don't think I've killed a frog yet.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** A toad.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** But I'm really, really looking forward to doing it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:12]** rolu i think is gonna take aim at the one that is pulling on vari 13 and is going to full action shoot both of them sorry shoot that one faster too so you're gonna shoot twice yes okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** God.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** That sounds awesome.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Three and 11.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Does an 11 hit?

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** That's just, that's with your bonuses.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** It's a slow toad.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** It should hit.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** No, that's completely misses.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** Yeah.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** What is wrong with us?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Yours is an energy weapon, right?

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** What me?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Yes.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Then it does hit.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Yes.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Oh, no way.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Okay.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Wow.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** 11, 11, 11.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** All right.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:45]** That's going to be eight points of damage.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** He's aiming carefully.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** First shot.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Maybe he misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:57]** Shoots his thing right in the eye.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** That's the end of your turn?

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** That's it.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** It's now that faster to its turn.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:06]** It actually releases its tongue from Vahri.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** Oh.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** And it's going to scatter into the hole.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Yes.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Even though it escaped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Vahri's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** So I'm going to move this.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:20]** I guess I'll leave it where it's at because the hole is there.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** I'm going to put a symbol on it so you guys know it's still a run.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** We can't see it, right?

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** We can't see it because it jumps in the hole.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Do you want me to just hide it?

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** I can just hide it from you.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Sure.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** All right.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** So that toad climbs back into the hole.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** It is now Termay's turn.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Seeing, I guess.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:48]** So Vari's now providing cover because she's in my line of sight between myself and the other toad.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I think she's probably still prone.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** She's still pinned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** She's released, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Oh, she's still prone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:57]** Well, she was not pinned and the thing released.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** And so she would still be prone.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Or they would still be prone.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** Okay, so they would be prone.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** And I want to, before I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:24]** fire i'm gonna attempt a life science check to see if i can find any info on these two nice uh that's a 22 22 that's enough that is oh yeah 22 is enough nice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:39]** so and that's 22 and that's so you get two facts anything specific you want to know uh weaknesses i don't know what can you give me i can give you the opposite of weakness okay uh

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:45]** Thasteron Fortification.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:54]** The plates that I mentioned earlier of impure Thasteron cover the Thaster Toad's back, protecting it from devastating injuries.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:59]** So there's a 20% mischance for critical hits.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** Great.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** Do you want to know a common fact about them, or do you want to know one of their abilities?

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** Uh, let's figure out one of their abilities.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Okay.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** So you already know the ability to grab.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:15]** Um, a fun ability though is the next one is constrict.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:22]** So once the, uh, fast road has you grappled, they can then roll again.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:34]** And if they beat, um, let me just check Casey plus nine, they can use constrict, which does one D eight plus two damage.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Jeez.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** All right.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Yeah.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:43]** Hey, Chuck, you better get out of there before he constricts you.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** As Jermaine's saying that, he's going to fire two rounds off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:48]** Nice.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Get it.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Okay.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** Okay.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** It'd be minus four, right?

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Yes.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** So 15?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** 15 hits.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** Nice.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Let's show them what's up.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Okay.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Only two damage left.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Okay.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** One more.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Come on.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** I don't think that's going to hit.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** 13.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** This is KAC or EAC?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** KAC.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** That also hits.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Yes.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Oh, nice.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Roll high.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Roll high.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Five.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Five points a day.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Nice.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:23]** Bam.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** All right.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Well done, Torme.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** It is now Voli's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Yeah.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Get this.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** We got to get this toad off.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** Chalker.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:37]** It's going to get defoliated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** So on Vahri's turn, they don't even get off of the ground.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:47]** They are just going to crawl back towards Tremé.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Or towards, I guess, the whole group.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Thaddeus and Tremé.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:55]** And so they are at your feet now, still on the ground, and almost like scrambling.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** They're just scrambling in fear.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** And that's...

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:26]** uh chuck you can't attack it it's just a minus two also you can try to skip i can't try to escape uh says you cannot move or take two-handed actions you are restrained by a creature effective you can't move and take it minus two penalty to your armor class attack rolls reflex saving throws initiative checks and dexterity based skill and ability checks and you cannot make attacks of opportunity


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:52]** can't take actions that require two hands what's if you can do one-handed it says you can't move that's how i understand so right which means i i actually the only thing i could try to do is escape because even if it's a it's a one-handed weapon shack because he's a tiny creature uses two hands yep fair so i'm gonna try to escape with my minus two strength modifier

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Oh, acrobatics is dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yo.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** But you still have minus two because of your thing, right?

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Yeah, you get a minus two penalty.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:05]** Your dex base ability except those made to grapple your opponent or escape from a grapple.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** So you don't have minus two.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** So you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** Yeah, so no minus two to escape.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Just standard acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Stop it.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Natural 20.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** Let's go.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Yeah.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Crush this mofo.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** That's a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** I'm going to call this to escape.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** I'm going to call this a GM action, like overriding a GM rule.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:30]** Since you rolled a natural 20, you kind of just yank your little foot out from the tongue, and I'm going to give you your full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:56]** look at this benevolence wow yeah seeing the effectiveness of the energy weapon check switches to his new asphalt blaster and uh opens fire all right take a shot oh yeah that is a 20 to hit 30 20 nice

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** for one.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** One damage.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** That's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** Good work.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Yeah, that was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** You're putting points on the board.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** He's going to turn to the to the toad and say, don't you ever lick me again!

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:14]** Using his not the face ability.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Oh, what does that do?

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** You've got to roll a will save.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** That's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** That does not pass.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:35]** So you take a minus four penalty against attacks made against me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** That's right.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** That's helpful because it is now that Toad's turn.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Wait, is that a move or that's a free action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** That's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Oh, so that is your move action.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** I thought you pulled out your weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Yeah, I thought you switched.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** I can't do that.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** You're right.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** I switched weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** That's a move action.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** Dang.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:01]** That sucks because it's now the faster toads turn and they shoot their tongue right back at you.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** And they died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** And that one's not sickened, is it?


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Nope.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** And it's got 20, I can't do math, 23 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:18]** To be fair, 19 would have also hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** So let's just keep this clear.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** It's 23.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** So that's greater than your KAC plus 4.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Yes.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** How does it compare to your KAC plus 13?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** It's not there.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** Okay.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** So you are grappled.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:39]** And there is one d4 of damage plus two.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Four.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Cool.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Grappled again.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** And it's four points of damage.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** Time to end this.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** What did you say?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Nothing.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Okay.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** All right.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** I'll let that pass, whatever the hell that was.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Yeah, I didn't hear what that was.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** I didn't hear it either.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** All right.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** He's going to do a full attack.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** The first one missed.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** The second one missed.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Oh, my God.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** What is going on?

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Thaddeus is like, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Well, I might as well tell you what I said.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** I said, are you going to actually hit something this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** Sad days, I guess not.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** No.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** Good thing you have plenty of darts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** Yeah, I have so many darts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Thank God.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Rolu?

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:30]** Rolu looks at Thaddeus, missed shots, and says, Thaddeus, put your big boy pants on.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** We need to save Shaq right now.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:39]** He is also going to do a full attack action with a different D20.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** And he missed both times with a 5 and a 7.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** I am just going to jump in the pit.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** I'm just going to jump in the pit.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** That's it.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** Avari, stay here.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** I'm glad you're okay.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** All right.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Well, now we're on to the next round.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** It is Treme's turn.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** Treme's going to shoot at it twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** We're just shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Just taking pop shots.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Just taking pop shots today.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Fish in a barrel.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Okay.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** That one missed for sure.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Not worth using my first level spells on this.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Jeff, did we establish a 13?

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** I know you're listening.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** What was the rule about shooting twice?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** What did you say?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:19]** A 13?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:27]** yeah 13 a 13 does hit yes yes all right let's do it big money big money big money

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Four points.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:34]** That's nice.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** Okay.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:38]** It is now Vahri's 13th turn.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** They are going to turn around.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** They're going to stay prone.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** They're going to pull out their pistol and shoot.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:51]** When you're prone, there's no penalty for ranged attacks, correct?

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:51]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** I think there is.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** I don't believe so.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** I think you get a bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** I think there's actually a bonus.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** You get a bonus two points to range attack.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** That sounds cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** Yep.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** No, no, no.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:11]** You gain a plus four bonus to your armor class against ranged attacks, but take a minus four to your AC against melee attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** And there's a minus four penalty to melee, but not range.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Nothing to range.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:15]** Nothing for range.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** Nothing to range.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:17]** Great.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** So they are going to pull out their tactical pistol and take a shot.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** At Choc?

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Yeah, at Choc.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** Cool.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** No, at the Thaster Toad.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** Oh, that's a natural one.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:36]** We're like blundering all over this thing.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** Cut a new card.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Cut a new card.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Yeah, it's crazy.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** Let's just pull this open.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** You can't take a guarded step for 10 minutes.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Oh, okay.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** Yeah.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** Wow.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** And they miss.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** And they miss.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** And that's Chuck's turn now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** We didn't accidentally hit Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** We're outside of a barn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:03]** Hey, speak for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** I'm a little tied up over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Trying to get you free, bud.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** We'll help you out, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** Just don't be constricted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** I'm going to try to escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:16]** Fight with all you can.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Fight with all you got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** And that is two.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Oh, wait, no, no.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** That's ten.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Well, that's ten.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** To escape the gravel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Oh, what did we say the DC was again?

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** I forget.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:30]** Ten plus the features KC.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Yeah, so you don't escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** Cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:39]** Uh, then for the other half of his turn, he's gonna, uh... I told you not to lick me again!

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** And Muse is not in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Okay.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:46]** And I roll... A will save!

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Will save!

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Will save!

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Ooh, an 18 on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]** I think we need a will save like a, like, a nice choir.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:57]** Like a beach boy's choir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** Will save!

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Will save!


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** You know, that's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** But an 18 passes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:03]** Oh, yes.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Yes.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Yes, it does.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Cool.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** That's your turn.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** It is now the Thaster Toad's turn.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:15]** Thaster Toad is going to take its tongue off and smack you in the face with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** That is a natural 20.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** What's going on?

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Dang.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Toad's going to take his head off.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Freaking Toad.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Is this a Three Stooges skit?

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:30]** Like, we are just eating it right now.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Oh, no, that's the wrong deck.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** I need the other deck, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:33]** Here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:34]** Yes.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** No, no, no.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** You need the critical hit?

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** No, you use the one that says critical fumble.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]** That's not how that works.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:44]** No, but in all real stuff, you're using the wrong deck.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:44]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** I think Kelly lost the critical hit deck.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** I don't know where it is.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** So I just choose a random one, right, Kevin?

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Sure.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** All right.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** That one, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Which one do I choose?

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** It's like four options here.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** I think it's the sword one, right?

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Oh, the sword one?

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:07]** The target's kinetic attacks deal half damage for 1d3 rounds.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Okay, so mark that down, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** and roll one d3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:17]** At least, like, yeah.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:20]** Just do any immediate real issue to you, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** I still roll the damage twice, right?

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** Yes.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** That's a six, so I get three rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:26]** Yeah, that's three.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]** That's three rounds of half damage for your kinetic.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** And that's six plus four.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Are you good, Chuck?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:35]** Are you down?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** For ten?

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** Oh, my good God.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** I'm not down, but I am into my hit points.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** Oh, man.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]** Hang in there, Shaq.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]** We'll get you out.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** This dog is eating my avocados, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** That's the end of the faster notes turn.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:56]** Thaddeus, go ahead.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** Gonna fall.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** It fucking hits.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** All right, so.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Finally.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:09]** Wait, let me roll the other one just in case.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** But like, does an 18 hit?

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** An 18 does hit, yes.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** Fantastic.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:16]** I need to roll for damage because I forgot what that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Wait, are you in soft cover?

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** No, sorry.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Bari's still prone.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** You're right.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Seven damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:22]** Yes.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:23]** Seven.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** And then it vaporizes, right?

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:25]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** No, not quite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** Going to aim quite and going to aim at the other eye that we didn't hit yet.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** Goes right through that eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:36]** Wait, was it your first attack or second?

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** I mean, they were both 22.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** But basically, 7.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** 7 total points.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:43]** 7 total attack points.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Or damage points.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]** So you hit twice for a total of 7 points.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:50]** Wait, I rolled the damage choice?

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** You said you did a full attack.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** Yeah, so you roll... So I add up my damage for both attacks?

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** You hit twice.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** I'm sorry.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** I thought that you choose...

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:02]** I'm so dumb right now.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** All right, nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** But you took the minus four off for... I'd already handled that, yeah.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** Okay, so you had seven points of damage.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** Nine in the first shot.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** And then what?

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:11]** And then two.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** And then two points.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** Okay.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** And so you take that second shot.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** Yes.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** Steady it.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:17]** Yes.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]** Fire it.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** It shoots through its cheek.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:22]** Into its throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:28]** And the tongue wraps tightly around Choc.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:29]** Falls limp.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:34]** And the Thastatode falls to the ground.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Yes!

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** That's right, Thastatode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** That's our key!

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** Yeah.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:55]** You were saying earlier, we'll lose something about... What was it?

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** Not hitting someone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** No, that was me, the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Oh, no, we'll lose it.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Everyone's saying it today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** Took you long enough.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:08]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:14]** Until next week, drift beegons on Distant Stars.
