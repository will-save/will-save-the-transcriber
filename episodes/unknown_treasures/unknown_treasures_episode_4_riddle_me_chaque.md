## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:59]** And welcome back to Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:04]** I'm going to start fading or phasing out the whole, like, we'll save the interstellar.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** Wait, what?

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:05]** Why?

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:10]** Because I feel like if you're listening to the fourth episode, you probably have already heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:18]** We'll save the interstellar tales from the extra galactic adventure anthology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:22]** Yeah, I think it's great and I love it, but like, I don't think I need to hear it every single episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** I disagree.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** I say it before bed every night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:28]** You're going to be reminded exactly what you're listening to every time.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:44]** I think I was also going to start fading out the whole, like, hey, tell me who your character is.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** By this point, people know who's who, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Yeah, but do they know our classes?


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** They don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** Do we know our classes?

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** Do we know our classes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Are we ready to reveal that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** I feel like it's already been revealed, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Kind of.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** For some of you, for some of you not.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** But let's get to the important conversation here.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** It's summer now.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Woo!

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Summertime.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** And I have a really big question for you.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** What do you prefer?

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** The pool or the beach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Oh, easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** Is that easy?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Yeah, it's pretty easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** Especially if you live in the desert?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** I'll go first.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** I prefer the beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** That's because I grew up on the East Coast and now I live on the West Coast, like literally on the coast.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:35]** So I'm down with the beach town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** The best coast?


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Which one's the best coast?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Jacksonville beaches are better than L.A.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** beaches.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Just going to say it.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** In terms of, like, the experience, you know.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Sure, the beauty.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Yeah, the mountains.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Are the waves even as high?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Do you guys even have waves in the Atlantic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:57]** Is there even water in the Atlantic Ocean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** It's like a puddle, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** It's really warm.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** It just rains a lot.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** It's a warm puddle of some dude's jersey.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:12]** I didn't mean to bring up a debate about which beaches are the best, but I prefer East Coast beaches.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** They're less sandy.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I think they're more like a... What?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Isn't that...

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:51]** no they're they're not like they're sand but like but their sand is like packed and and like wet sand as opposed to that like crystalline sand that gets all everything okay you're just judging southern california then yeah yeah here's a question what about like san diego will technically live at the beach because he has sand surrounding his pool or you will have sand surrounding your pool uh you can have a beach on a lake right like you can technically have a beach at a lake that's true yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** So, Will, Benny's skeptical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** I am.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:00]** If it's a lake, if it's a, I mean, it's not a beach.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** It's a lakeshore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** It's a lakeshore, huh?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** It's not a lake beach.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** Oh, I'm down at the shore.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Down at the shore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** You could call it a beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** We're going down to the shore from my tires.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** You want to come?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** Yeah.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:20]** I could call my Nissan Sentra a 300ZX, but it's still a Sentra.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Kelly smirks at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I don't understand.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** Kelly lives on a very long beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:33]** Kelly lives on a really long beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Kelly, what do you prefer?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** It's actually three options now.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** East Coast beaches, West Coast beaches, or the pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:47]** Okay, so my experience on the East Coast beaches was that there were no waves, but I could have been to the wrong.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** I don't know where I was where this was happening.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** I don't even know how they have surf shops on the East Coast.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:57]** But there must be waves because hurricanes happen there like all the time, right?

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:00]** So you just have to surf during a hurricane.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** That'd be cool, I guess.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Some alligators chilling out.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** I don't know.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Saltwater alligators.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** Do you like how much I know about stuff?

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Not that much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:13]** I do like the sandy beaches of the Caribbean and the East Coast.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** They are quite nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Caribbean's cool.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** But between a pool and a beach, for sure, I prefer the beach.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** I don't like public pools.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** Personal pools, I'd probably just be chilling with a couple people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Beach is better.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:30]** I'm going to go off script and say hot tub.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Oh, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** Will is generously nodding for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:42]** Listen, I am for bodies of water.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** I'm not a beach versus pool.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:53]** I like my infinity pool to overlook a beach, okay?


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** That's fair.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Next to a hot tub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:01]** If you don't like it to overlook another pool, then you're probably like, I don't know.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** What about swamps and stuff?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Do you like those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** I like the Great Dismal Swamp outside of North Carolina.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Shout out to North Carolina.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** North Carolina.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:15]** Well, I think it's important for me to say that I don't like nature very much, and I prefer to just be indoors.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:22]** Kev is the person who's like, man, I'm really excited to go to this indoor pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** That's right.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Gosh, I love a good indoor pool.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** Smells like chlorine and old men.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** I live inside of a tin can in the ocean.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** It's a little different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** That's true.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** I do prefer pools for actually swimming, like as an exercise.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** Because I don't want to open water to swim.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** That's just dangerous, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Kevin, I have a dumb question.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Do you have a word?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:51]** Are there in this day and age, and not just in old books or whatever from the industry, are there actually portholes in submarines?

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** There aren't, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Okay, yeah, of course not.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Because the pressure would break the glass.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** There's no way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:01]** Technically, there are submarines that are recreational use submarines that do have portholes.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:09]** The submarine at Disneyland has portholes, but military submarines do not have portholes.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** No, there's no...

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:14]** The only way to look out of it is through the periscope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** They have screen doors, though.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Did you have screen doors?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** A sea monster.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** What?

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** It's like a giant squid or like a kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** Have you seen the troll inside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Did you finally find Nessie?

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:31]** And you're like, I work in the engine room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** But you had to slay a troll.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:38]** Yeah, but I didn't do a whole lot in the sonar stuff.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** But you knew the PPR tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Oh yeah, sorry, sonar, not radar.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** So you're just shoving coal into engines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:52]** They do know the difference between man-made objects and what they call quote-unquote biologicals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** Kevin, are there sea monsters that the U.S.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** government is hunting down that we don't know about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I can't tell you that, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Kevin, you told us that you fought a troll or whatever.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Come on, dude.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** You had to shut down a nuclear reactor.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I think he let that slip, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** And we've just been... We never edited it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Oops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Oops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Gonna get me in trouble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** We already did.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** No.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Okay, well.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Is that the official answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** That's right.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** There is no truth.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:28]** But speaking of truths, John, we're going to need two of them and one lie.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** For a little game we call Two Truths and One Lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I think I'm going to do the two lies and the truth game.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:37]** That was the last time.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** All right.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** That sounds good.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** I have one.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Do I have two?


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** When your whole world's a lie, it's hard to come up with truths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** Yeah, when all I do is deal in what is real and not real, I blur my own reality.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** What am I?

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Okay, I got two.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** Now I need a third thing.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:10]** You guys should keep talking for a sec while I just grab that third thing from my brain storage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Or I just sit here silently.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Staring.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:14]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Waiting.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Dead air.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** Yeah.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:27]** Who was the author that wrote steampunk, that wrote books that had things like steampunk style stuff?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** What was that?

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** I have no idea.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** 40,000 Leagues Under the Sea or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** Oh, Vern.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Oh, Jules Verne.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Jules Verne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** Did he also do Journey to the Center of the Earth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** I think so.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:45]** I read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea while traveling 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:55]** Which is, fun fact, if you don't know, 20,000 leagues under the sea is actually a huge distance because it's talking about a horizontal distance, not a vertical one.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** It's not a depth.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** It's a distance.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Okay.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** They traveled a total of 20,000 leagues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Oh, that's confusing.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** They should have said across under the sea.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:13]** They should have said vector and not just magnitude, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Because one league is 5,000 miles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Oh, so there's no way you could track.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Because it doesn't go down that deep.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Hold on.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** I'm trying to look it up.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Kevin, how deep is the ocean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Oh, a league is 3 miles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** Yeah, I was like, I don't think it's 5,000 miles.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** That's a lot of miles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** No, that was miles to feet, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** That's like possibly greater than the circumference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Yeah, one league is 3 miles.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** So the ocean is definitely not 60,000 miles deep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** All right, I got him.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** I got him.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** I got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Cool.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Number one.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** I have driven across the contiguous U.S.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Number two.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:06]** My pants fell down when I was in a fifth grade play.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** Number three.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** I almost died from a disease when I was eight.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** I say lie on the first one, I feel.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** Yeah, what is... I've never gotten these right, but I feel like it is.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:24]** I have to recuse myself from this, because I was here for all three of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Well, you could be there for all three.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** Yeah, but it wasn't in fifth grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** It was probably in fourth grade or third grade.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Wait, did Vinny pull down your pants in fifth grade?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** It was Vinny that did it?

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** Did Vinny give you a disease when you were little?

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:44]** I could see you driving across with Vinny the contiguous United States, but for some reason... Did Vinny give you a disease?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:48]** So, when you say the contiguous United States... He touched his petri dish.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** You're talking Florida to California.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Florida to California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** That's all he's ever done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Okay.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Or theoretically.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** Or like Maine, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** Or, you know, road trip to Maine.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Question.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Can we ask questions?

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Like, did you do this with Vinny?

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Like, the drive-in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** I'm not going to say anything.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:12]** I'm going to say number two's the lie, and only because it was at a different grade than fifth grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Yeah, I'm going to agree.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Oh, that's a good one.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** I'm going to say number two's not even a lie.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** It's a mistruth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** Oh, interesting.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** What's the difference, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:26]** Because I think a lie is completely false, where the mistruth he's, like, adjusting to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:31]** It's an alternate truth, is that what we're... Yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** It's an alternate... God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Okay, so... It's like an alternate universe.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** So Will and... Benny has recused himself.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:40]** Will and Kevin say it's the second one because of the fifth grade thing.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Man, it's weirdly specific.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:47]** I'm not good at true truths and a lie guessing, but I'm going to stick with my first guess.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** I'm perfect, I think, so far.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Which is the first one?

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Yeah, I don't have a good record of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Yeah, the first one.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Cool.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** It's definitely number two.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** It's absolutely number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:10]** But it's because the only play that I was going to be in in elementary school was the play, and right before it, I got the disease that caused me to miss the play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** So your pants would have fallen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** His pants fall down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Then he probably would have pulled him down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** I would have ensured that happened, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** Easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Handily.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I'm sorry you got sick.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** What was the disease, John?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** I have bacterial meningitis.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:50]** what is that that's a really deadly thing it was yeah shit yeah it's a bacteria in the brain my uh my dad took me to the er because i told him i could see two tvs it was because my brain is was swelling and then they gave me a spinal tap and i didn't feel any of it i was just like very out of it so i was in the hospital did you have a stiff neck iv yeah yeah i did yeah yeah and a rash on your back

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:54]** I don't remember a rash, but the thing is that like you come out of it.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** I had a lot of tests afterwards.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** They were like all the audio, all the visual tests.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Did they quarantine you?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** No, they didn't quarantine me because it wasn't viral.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** It was just bacterial.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** So it was like –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** Even if it was viral, it's not infectious, right, usually?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Really?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:15]** I thought it was highly transmissible, but maybe I'm wrong.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** Oh, shit.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** I'm not a real doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** I hate anything biological.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:28]** I heard that usually, like, if you get it when you're, like, an infant or very young, then it's tough because you're still developing a lot of process in your brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** But you were fully developed at the age of five, so when you got it at eight, you were fine?

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Sure, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** Oh, and the contiguous U.S.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** thing is that, yes, so Vinny flew out to L.A., which I think we talked about.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Vinny's day in L.A.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** was probably like a magical day.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** Like, I don't know how it all happened, but we'll talk about that later.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:49]** And then we drove to Florida, and then my buddy – or our buddy Andrew and I –

**[00:14:50 - 00:15:11]** jumped in and then we drove up to main and then we drove west over to like yellowstone and then we came down oh that's cool yeah yeah wow good times thank you for john for that john we really i'm just scoring perfects on this yeah wait who is left to go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** That's it.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** We've all gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** I think we did everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** So then who won, basically?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:14]** Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** I don't think this is perfect.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Is there a winner?

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** I think this is just... I think we all just, like, lose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Yeah, I think we've lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** We all lose, except for Will, who won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** Right.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** It's all our truths are, like, horrible.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** It is.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** The rich get richer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Now we've got to come up with a new game every week.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** But, you know, a game that we can play...

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Starfinder.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** What?

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Starfinder.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** All right.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** So let's play.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Let's play.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:47]** Before we go into the actual game, Kelly, did you figure out your resolve points?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** We talked about that.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:55]** Vinny, Chuck actually healed you before you had to spend your resolve points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** Yeah, I believe that that's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** So your dad won resolve points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** All right.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:07]** So let me just do a small recap of what happened last week.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:12]** So last time, you finished off the fight with the True Warriors.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** Thaddeus got knocked down a couple of times.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** And by knocked down, I mean unconscious, almost dying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:44]** right yeah a lot for number for level one because you're a cheat yeah yeah yeah because plus plus he said that those particular characters target melee uh what was it they don't target tough looking dudes the tough yeah so that's a compliment to you yeah you're tough looking basically they run by prison he's been through some shit always go after the toughest looking dude


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:56]** Right after that, though, Torme was actually able to take out one of the Hilkey Thugs with an overheat where he just blew fire at them, like some kind of fire dancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** Sure, if you want to categorize it that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** Fire dancer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** That was a really, really cool description until you said dancer.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:10]** I take kindly to that characterization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** That's actually when the gang started to retreat.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:18]** So the Yosuke ran over and started dragging his downed colleague up the alleyway.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** You guys made an attempt to stop them, but they made it to the car.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** They actually made it to the car.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** Yeah, because you cheated.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** There's no debate here.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** They made it to the car.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** And then the car sped off into the streets.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:34]** Torme actually noticed that the hilky woman in the backseat of the car – And Roland.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** No, Rollu missed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Yep.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:54]** And then Riddle explained to you all that Dotrulu and his gang, the True Warriors that came from Morrow, the ones that beat you guys up bad, pretty badly, are squeezing this town and the junk tourism industry for all that it's got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** Oh yeah, we went to Junkers to Light.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** You did, yeah.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** We're in the back of house, chilling, right?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** The back of house?

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** Yeah, we're chilling in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Are we where the cool kids are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** I think it's just a building.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** There's no front or back.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** It's just one big delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** Can I get a definition on junk tourism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** Yeah, so, okay, roll a culture check.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:32]** No, so junk tourism is that Kefauk Depot is hundreds of years old of just like damaged and destroyed ships and vehicles.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** And so it's a giant junkyard is what it is.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** It's a desert full of junk.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:43]** And so junk tourism are people who travel to this field of junk

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** In hopes of finding something better.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** In hopes of finding the riches that can help them level up in life.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Yeah.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:58]** So, again, going back to where we were at, Dotrulu and his gang are squeezing that tourism trade.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** And Riddle is actually the last holdout against him.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** She's the owner of Joker's Delight, which is a gift shop slash junk adventures guide company.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** They got...

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:14]** adventurers into the junkyards in order to find their treasured junk.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:23]** The only thing is that her last client was an overzealous and very wealthy rich researcher that was looking for something that could...

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Change the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** Change the face of the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Right.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** And since then, they've gone missing.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** That's wild.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:36]** And that's a relief off.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** So, yeah, you guys are sitting inside Junker's Delay.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** It is, I mean, it's picture-like.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** I don't know.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:47]** It's half, like, gift shop, half, like...

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** I don't know.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** Has anybody actually been to any kind of junkyard?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** What's the tour company called?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Um,

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Star Tours?

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** No, we would go to book a tour.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:07]** Back before Expedia and all those internet programs, people actually had to go into offices and sit down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Like a travel agency?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** That's a travel agency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** It's like half gift shop, half travel agency.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** Except for the travel, quote unquote, is going into the junkyards.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** So you guys are sitting there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** Are you asking if I've ever been in a travel agency?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:31]** I mean, I have like twice when I was a kid, I think, but I've never... My aunt runs a lot.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:41]** But overall, Riddle does offer to pay you guys each $500, sorry, 500 credits if you can help her find her client.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** And her client is an android named Vari13.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:53]** She describes Vari as a skinny android about medium height with green braids and golden circuits that you can see through their skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** Sorry, golden circuits and what kind of skin?

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** 500 apiece.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** See through skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** It's just that the circuits glow through the skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Ah, okay.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** We're looking at 500 apiece, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:09]** Yeah, yeah, I can give you 500 apiece, but you've got to bring her back alive, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:16]** So not like... Not like per piece of very 13, but like 500 for each of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** I'm sorry, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** Thaddeus just chuckles.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** What if we're too late?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:30]** Vara 13 needs to come back as a whole person, and they better be alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:41]** I think what my small colleague here was saying was that, yeah, just a good clarification on the alive versus not alive, or rather functioning versus not functioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** He could be missing an arm and still be alive, right?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** What about psychologically tortured?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** So you guys are who are you again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:56]** Listen, we're not trying to cause harm to this fella.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** But, you know, if if something happens to him, I'm not going to.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** I don't know.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** I can't be held responsible for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:13]** Well, I can't be giving you guys your credits if you don't bring them back as a solid, breathing, wholesome person.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** Because that's kind of my job is to guide these people in and out.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** So that's all I'm saying is, wait a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:28]** So you're just worried about a claim against you from this person's family if something were to happen to him.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** My reputation's on the line here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** I think we're getting a little bit too into the weeds here.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:41]** I think at the end of the day, the point is that we are definitely absolutely willing to help you, Riddle.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:49]** And we thank you for the hospitality as well as for the opportunity to help you out and, you know, grease the wheels a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** I got a question for you.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** Are you guys pirates?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** I object to that term, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:04]** I knew not all pirates are bad, but like, is this like, are you like good pirates or are you guys like enemy of my enemy type situation going on here?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** What kind of question is that?

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:14]** I'm just curious because like, what are space pirates doing down on the ground with the rest of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:24]** You know, space pirates, we're here to see a Shabad meet an untimely demise, as we've stated previously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** Roll gestures and nods at Tormadin's answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** So this is an enemy of my enemy thing.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Like, you're here to take out the Trulu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Maybe.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** We'll leave those details to ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** What's it to you?

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** I mean, he's been causing a lot of trouble for me, at least in this town.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** But I don't want no one to get hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:56]** Do you have any leads on where Dotrulu might be staying or maybe keeping some safe houses, maybe some other resources?

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:01]** We're just looking to help out and put the squeeze where we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** No, I totally get it.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** Look, the true warriors, they come beating down on me all the time, but I've never seen Dol Trullo himself.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:16]** If anything, you'd have to go after the lower guys and try to find out more information.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** Maybe you could lure him out by beating them up.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:22]** But they're dangerous folks.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** I know you guys look pretty tough, but they ain't anybody to mess with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:37]** Do you have, like, a really handy, useful interface, like a video game where it's, like, all the figures are blacked out, and then when we find them, then their faces pop up, and slowly it will hierarchy up to Dotrulu at the top?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** I used to have a COD deck.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:45]** I only had one COD deck, and Dotrulu was the Ace of Spades, but, like, I sold that a long time ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** That's really cool, actually.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** If we find that in the junkyard, I'm going to take it.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** I'm not going to give it back to you.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Yeah, that sounds awesome.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** That's fair.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Not going to lie.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:58]** So back to these lower ranks.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:03]** Any information on who these might be or where to find out some more information here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:09]** I can't tell you much more about the True Warriors except I'm sure they're going to come back around here sooner or later.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:16]** The one thing I just need to know, are you guys going to help me find Vary13 or am I going to have to find someone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** We'll do our best as long as we can...

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:25]** We're still getting our bearings around here, I say.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:32]** Yeah, I'm game, but... I'm also game, but let's not mistake it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** We are here, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** But we have our own interests here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** I got you, but I could definitely use your help, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Do you have any... Yeah, you have it with us.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Do you have any supplies you can give us?

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** That will help us find your friend.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** Destroy Totolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** What kind of supplies are you guys looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** Healing serums, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:00]** I can get you some healing serums, but you're going to have to pay the price for them.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** You know, I can't.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** I got to replenish my goods.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Maybe I could take it out of your credits that I give you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** I got to look up how much I charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:24]** Maybe you can just give one or two, slide it over on the house, because we are both helping out with the Trulu and with very 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** I am beginning to see why you don't get much help around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** I do agree with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** One or two.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:31]** That is.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** I do agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** All right, look, I got two Mach 1s that you guys can borrow.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** And I say borrow because I need them for myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Hopefully we won't need them.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:45]** We'll extract them from our blood and then put them back in the vial and go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:51]** Yeah, I mean, we did help you out of a terrible situation a moment ago, did we not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:56]** How many things do we have to say to make it obvious you need to give us these serums?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** Who wants to hold the serums?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** You say it's Kelly.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** I think check.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** That's fine.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Jack will take them.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Oh, Jack.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** Jack is reliable for healing.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** I think that's good.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** He takes them and tucks them under a leaf.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** A little vine just sucks them in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** And a bit more about Vary 13.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** Where were they last seen?

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Where was their last known whereabout?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:30]** So Vary 13, she was supposed to be heading out to the car yards and

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** But, like, Logan's with her, so, like, they should be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Who's this Logan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** Yeah.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Logan's my best and last guy.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** He's one tough cookie, and he's been to the car yards, like, at least a dozen times.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** He knows his way around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** Do you have any description of him?

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** How would we spot him or his body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** Um, he, he's a very large human male.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** Um, cause he's at least twice, maybe three times my size.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** The little, like she's a little Yosuke.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** So she just kind of shrugs.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** Um, but she does know that he is, he's from Epsilon station.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** So he's not a Hilkey.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** That's one way to determine, like he's, he's got paler skin and he's not, you know,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:40]** beaten by the desert as badly sorry and you said lorgan like morgan but with an l uh what's a morgan i ain't never heard of the name morgan it's a name only pirates give each other but uh sorry it's you were saying lorgan could you spell that for me uh yeah yeah lorgan with an l like it's normally spelled you know oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Of course.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:45]** L-U-R-G-A-N-E.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:48]** Yeah, spell it out entirely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Welcome to my world, John.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** This is what I do every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** But you know what the difference is?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** I give you the spelling every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** I made the name up, man.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** I corrected it in your notes.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** It's spelled L-O-R-G-A-N, so like Morgan Bones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** You could have just said that from the beginning.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** You're bad.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** Well, then, I think that would be the first place to look, wouldn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** I mean, that's the last place I know she would have gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Just about this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Sorry, they.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Correction.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:27]** Just for clarification, Vari 13 is non-binary, so they go by they.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Yep.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Okay.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** That's what I thought.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** And Riddle is she, her?

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** Yes, Riddle is she, her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Fun.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:44]** Just about this time, Thaddeus gets a little ping on his communicator, and it's from someone on the ship.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** He doesn't know from whom yet.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** But it's a relayed signal from the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** And it's like... And you hear this little mumbling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** And then you just see his ears perk up.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Like cats that go... Like that.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** And his fur stand on end.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** And his eyes widen.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** And then he just turns around and stares at Rolu.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** And then he just turns off his communicator.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** And looks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** So I'm thinking Verlo kind of turns away from the Verlo.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Tried to talk to you for.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:26]** It sounds like we might have to wait a little bit.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** Cool off on this.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** And in the meantime, we check out this very 13.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** How are we feeling about that?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** It seems like the best way to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:43]** I mean, I ain't trying to rush you guys, but the longer she's missing, the longer she's got a chance something's going to go bad.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:49]** Like, Logan normally checks in by now, and it's been a couple days, and he hasn't called me back.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** I'm starting to worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:59]** Are you sure that if we don't just go do a bunch of side quests, then when we see Logan, he'll say the same thing as if we had just went to him immediately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:22]** um i mean like i don't play a whole ton of video games but like it's probably not like a typical like role-playing rpg type game where it's got a trigger point but like you know he might currently be alive and the longer you guys take he might not be alive understandable if i had to guess does anybody else want to take 10 because i could use the stamina points

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:26]** I'm just curious, so let's just talk about your guys' health and stuff.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Thaddeus has been dead twice.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:33]** What time of day is it right now?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** It's probably getting into later afternoon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Okay, so like 3.30.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** It's around dinner time for Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:48]** Close to dinner time for all humans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:49 - 00:32:12]** uh i mean do you want to try to turn in and search for the android tomorrow yeah what do you guys thoughts on that i mean you're gonna go out and try to find a hotel you're gonna sleep in the streets i could do a short rest and be fine to go keep looking into the night which is kind of i kind of like the idea of looking into the night it's a cool thing and i want kev to put a night mode on the map um

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** But I would also be down to just take a full rest.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** I'm just not down very many spells, so that's just Rolu personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** Well, I think it may make sense narratively.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:27]** I would expect on a desert planet that more activity happens at night than during the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:31]** Thaddeus, how are you feeling about right now?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** You certainly were knocked down more than once.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** He says that with a grin.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** I think I can...

**[00:32:39 - 00:33:03]** make it i'll i'll top up if i need to i don't need a full rest oh you're gonna use those those uh here yeah those things that we're we're borrowing yeah uh-huh yeah we'll we'll we'll borrow them we'll let you borrow i gotta look at the price on those things but like i'm gonna need you guys to pay it back right yeah we'll circle back to that at some future point riddle that's fine i got a business to run here a pirate always pays his debts

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** That's what they say.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Absolutely.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** That's what pirates are known for.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Especially pirates named Morgan.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** They always pay their debts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** Morgan?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** There's no pirate named Morgan.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Stop making stuff up, John.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** We're playing real life here.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** That's Captain Morgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:48]** Kelly you can either use the healing serum I could burn a first channel and give you the 1d8 stamina points that I woefully tried to use last time so I could try and do that if you want or you can use the healing serum because I don't know how many we have we just have those two right yeah I think we only have those two you guys didn't bring any on your own I brought two but we burned them and how many resolve points do you have Kelly two out of three none of us thought to make a healer class


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** Hey, I know you guys have helped me a lot.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:54]** I don't have a whole lot more to give you because that's my last two serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:54 - 00:34:03]** You got anything else that could help us take out this Detrolu or keep these guys at bay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** Look, the Detrolu stuff, you handle the Shabab however you want to handle the Shabab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:14]** But I need you guys to bring back Vary 13 for me.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:23]** At least... Right, but if the true warriors have their hands on him... I mean, honestly, I don't think that the true warriors have any idea what Vahri's looking for.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:27]** But, like, if they're involved, then you do what you gotta do.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:35]** The only thing I got, and she starts rummaging through, and you guys notice that there's, like, sculptures kind of

**[00:34:35 - 00:35:05]** around the room small ones up to like a full size one but she picks up one that kind of is like a medium sized looking sculpture thing of just junk welded together and she hands it to one of you and goes I guess you guys can like borrow this one too this one there's not really any value on it it's a little keepsake of mine and what she hands you is a breakaway age system yeah let me give you a show is that the right I hope I'm showing the right thing

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Bam.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:13]** So it's basically interlocking metal pieces that you put on your arm.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** That's cool.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** And it provides a little bit of protection.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:20]** And she actually says – like she winces a little bit and is like, man, I wish I would have been K in that earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** That's so cool.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** So –

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:29]** It's basically like this breakaway of interlocking metal that fits on the wearer's arm.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:37]** And when you get hit by a melee attack from an opponent, you can perceive, you can use the Aegis to absorb some of the blow.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:44]** It negates five damage, but the Aegis crumbles into component pieces, and you've got to spend ten minutes putting it back together.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** That's super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Yeah, it is kind of cool.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** This book has a lot of junk related things.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** I love it.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** I hope you guys come across.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Who wants it?

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** So you guys take that.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Yeah, who's going to take that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Shaq really wants it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** Yeah, I also want it, but I think Shaq should take it because Shaq is somebody who needs it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:09]** Yeah, I've got a total of 14 damage points that he can take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** I got a total of 13.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Oh, what?

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** I think.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Hold on.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Let me double check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:22]** I think Rolo is going to... I don't think Rolo saw anything as far as Thaddeus giving him a look because Rolo is just sipping his tea and thinking.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** So Rolo doesn't know anything about that whole thing.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Never mind.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** I have 14.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Okay.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:34]** I think he would, like, playfully slap Thaddeus on the back and be like, maybe you need this to save you from going down so many times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** That may actually make sense.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** Thaddeus just looks grim-faced at, like, having a ruler talk to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** I remember my first fight.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** It was much the same.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** It was tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:50]** Hey, I'm not trying to say, like, you ain't looking bad, but, like, Thaddeus ain't looking good.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:56]** You guys, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your jobs because, like, I put you on the job now and you got to do your job.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** But, like, if you want, you guys could stay here.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:04]** And she kind of, like, shrugs and waves at three bunks in the corner.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** Who's bunking with who, Lord?


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** I'm working on it.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** Okay.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** You guys, like one of you guys could take the couch over in the lobby.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:17]** And she says like over in the lobby, but Rick, really, there's just a couch kind of next to the desks.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** It's not a very big space.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Yeah.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Check.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:27]** Check finds like a tire filled with sand and just like curls up in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** I do have a pot.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** That sounds perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Wait, so is Thaddeus taking the Aegis?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:38]** He'll take it if he's going to be involved in combat more than others.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** You guys could roll off.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Yeah, I guess that's fine.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Roll off!

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** I'm going to use these dice that Will gave me.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** They're auspice.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** I guess they mean auspicious dice, which is good.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** That's cool.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** It's a good thing we need that right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Who's rolling off?

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** Am I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Whoever wants it.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** I guess Shaq and Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Yeah, I think Shaq, Thaddeus, and Tormadin, right?

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Because Tormadin, you also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Oh, look at this dice.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Is that an 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** It's a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Oh.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** I got an 18.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Will, are you rolling off on this?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** I can.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** I also rolled a four.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** No way.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Let's see what Kelly got.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** I got an 18, actually.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Cool.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Crushed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** What are you guys rolling off for?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I wasn't paying attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** For the Aegis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** I'll just tank for you guys as much as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** Do you have a map to these car yards?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:49]** I don't, but if you just go out here and you make a right and then make another right and then you make a left onto Juniper, you just walk right up Juniper and it's right there at the end.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** It's kind of a northeast side of town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:56]** You see Jack unfold a leaf and start scribing on the leaf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:04]** I'm saying, so if Kevin is telling us, suggesting to us that we should be resting.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** I'm not suggesting.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** I'm just saying if you want to, you can.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** He did bring it up.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:11]** I have a feeling Kevin's going to throw a bunch of shit at us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** I think he really wants to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** All right, you guys are moving on.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** No, we're resting.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** So are we long resting or short resting?

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I think we're short resting.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** I don't know.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Or resting does what again?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Jack is at fault.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Short rest will give you back your stamina.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** A long rest will give you back your stamina and resolve and give you one hit point per level.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** But you guys are only level one, so it gives you one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** But you spend a resolve.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** I'm fine either way.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Why don't we short rest?

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** All right.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Ten minutes flashes by.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Why don't we long rest?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** We don't really have any time constraints as far as we can tell.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** This isn't like where we're going to blow up.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** Because then I could get my spell back, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Oh, yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Spells are important.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** I don't play a spellcaster ever, so... Let's do it.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** And NPCs don't rest a whole lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** Shock, you're welcome to run with me if you want.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** It's up to you.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** And he just smiles a toothy grin.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** And he just lays down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Thanks, I'm fine with my pot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** So we long rest through the early hours of the night.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Well then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** So night flashes, morning dawns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Does anything happen?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:30]** I feel like Rolu, as he's falling asleep, has these flashes, these images in his brain, and he just tries to push them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** And then falls asleep.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** So anything else happens throughout the night?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** You guys are inside of Junkers Delight.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Doors are closed.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:43]** The windows are actually, like, buttoned up pretty tight, because she is afraid of these true warriors.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:46 - 00:41:08]** so it's actually a pretty quiet night it's not like they burn down the building while you're in it a little too quiet um in a in like a cut scene with with while jack is resting in his pot you notice him pull out a communicator who's you i just want to clarify this oh uh jack anybody want to roll perception no i'm just kidding um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** I do, actually, on the outside of Junkers, if possible.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Can I peer out a window?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:18]** Can I see if somebody set up an ambush or something for us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** You rolled a natural 20 and you still don't see anything.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** There's nothing going on.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** It's quiet.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:33]** But we look at Chuck, kind of curled up in his pot, his tire, and everybody else is sound asleep.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** But the camera focus is in on Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Yep.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:44]** It's like a, it's like a text communicator so that he doesn't have to make any noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** And you see at the top mobile psychic or Tina, he's got turned up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:48 - 00:42:00]** It's like, you see captain with like two hearts and a pirate hook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:13]** And in the message, potential distraction rescuing android shouldn't be an issue.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:22]** Goal of killing Dotrulu has been exfiltrated.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** No meaningful concerns to the mission at this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** And shortly after that, there's just like the dot, dot, dot.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Damn it.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Keep it down.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** We don't want people knowing what's happening.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Whoops.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** But this is only to Chuck.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Copy is his response.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** None of you guys know this.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** I should have made you take your headphones off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** I truly was typing something, so I... Ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Cool.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:56]** All right, so the sun comes up through, like, the little beams of light through the edges of the sealed-off windows.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Yeah.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** And what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** Chuck waves his leaf with directions, like, all right, guys, let's go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:29]** sounds good to me what is what has riddle been doing is riddle up uh yeah riddle is actually sleeping and kind of late you guys can wake her if you want um she has an automatic coffee pot that started up at 5 30 finished by six but she is still sound asleep because she was pretty beat up yesterday well we just could go in looking for this very 13 before the heat of the day gets us

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Taking in temperatures.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** I like it.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** So do you guys head out?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Yes.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Yeah, we head out.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:39]** I'm going to move you over to the Kafak Depot map.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** Boom.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Look at that.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** I got to move there too, apparently.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** You see the numbers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Yes.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Numbers and the key in the bottom left corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** There is a key in the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** So we want to go to the car yard over here, as you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Yeah, you're saying.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** Park your car too far in the yard.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** Park your car in the car yard yard.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:05]** I think I want to just go to Ixamander's Throne.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** That sounds cool.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** I'm joking.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** I don't want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** You guys can if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Where is the car yards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** So car yards.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Head over to car harbor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** They're in the northeast part of the map.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** She told you if you go out artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** So the exit here is kind of to the left on this map.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** And she said, make a right and then a right.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** And then you make a left and it'll take you right to the car yard.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** So, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** She pointed you straight towards it.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** And that's just the gate to the car yard.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** The car yard is actually a very large area to the northeast.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Okay.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Let's head out.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Do you guys take any detours?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** You're just heading straight to the car yard?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Yeah, straight there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Is there like a Kefauver?

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** What's going on outside?

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** That's the thing.

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:04]** Um, when you guys come out, it's, it's like you said, eerily quiet and there's nobody on the streets and you guys don't know whether it's, is it just that early in the morning?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Did anybody check the time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** Yeah, I would have checked my, yeah, I thought you said it was six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Well, I said the coffee pot went off at 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** What time did we get up?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:15]** I feel like Rolu got up at like 6.15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Gee, Kev, tell us what kind of day is it?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** What time of day?

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** Is it a 24-hour day even?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Like a high holy day and we missed it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** Make me ask for everything.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** It is hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:32]** It is already 28 degrees Celsius at 9 a.m.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** Yeah, so it's a hot day, and you don't know the city well, so you don't know if it's bustling or not normally.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** But, like, last night it was.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** But now it's kind of empty.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** And so you guys start making your way.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** And so I'm going to move you to this map.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Bam.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Another T-shaped alley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** There's not going to be any combat here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Oh, wow.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** So we start... Looks like we're standing at the western edge of an alley.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** Is this close to the car yards or closer to Junkers Delight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** You're probably about halfway to the car yards at this point.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** Halfway to car yards.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:18]** So as you're walking through, again, these streets are just empty and you're not sure whether this is... Wait, Thaddeus is... Tormadin is starting to move his token on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:25]** I am moving towards the sidewalk, it looks like, to try and keep some cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:29]** Yeah, I think Rulu's going to take in one hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** He's going to pull out his... Oh, you guys are suspicious, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Yeah.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:39]** It just... If we've been walking this far... All right, let's move you to the next map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** I'm just... All right.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** No, so you... Yeah, I'll give you that.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Stay exactly where you are at this point.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** Okay.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:50]** And what you see is... Like a tumbleweed roll across?

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** Yeah, if this works the way I...

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:15]** yep yeah yeah we all like freak out like you see a tumbleweed roll across and then you see a foot that kicked the tumbleweed um not these nope you actually see you see the a couple of um why do they have to look like the bad guy from like that after earth cartoon after earth i forget what it's called it's amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** So one of them is actually going to step forward.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:24]** And as they kind of approach you, they just step forward, but they're not walking towards you.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** But they're definitely in your sight now.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:37]** And the one closest to you slightly, he's got bandages on his hands and up and around his neck.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** And if you look close enough, you actually see blisters kind of around his cheeks.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:45]** And his jacket is charred.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, he's got a gun in one hand and a baton in the other.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:55]** And then the other guy has his left sleeve is kind of charred, but that's about it.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** And he's the same thing.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** He's got a baton in one hand, pistol in the other.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:03]** And they see you guys and they're like, well, well, well, look what we just ran into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:07]** It looks like somebody wanted more tickets to the barbecue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:11]** I think we're just here to take you out a couple more times, if you know what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** You didn't hear?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:15]** We incinerate our trash around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** I put on some flame-resistant sunblock, so I'm good.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Look, I got one question for you.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** What's your deal with Riddle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** You want to make a deal for Riddle?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** What's your deal with Riddle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** Did she hire some, like, off-planet thugs?

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Are you guys all she could afford?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** I'm not hired gun.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Do I look like one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** You don't look like much more than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** You look like a dead Inquisitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** I don't think you understand.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** This is true warrior turf.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** You ought to do a better job of securing it.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** This is our area, and you better get out of here.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** Look, you guys can leave now, and we'll forget that we ever ran into you.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** But if you want to make this happen, we can make this happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** You want to make a deal with us, you better get your boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Oh, there ain't no deal, buddy.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** And he starts perching you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** You're right.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** There ain't no deal.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** That's it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** It's escalated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** Tormodon, it might be helpful just for a minute.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** You can always incinerate them later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Can I have one of you guys roll perception?

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Just one.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Pick who's going to roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** Maybe we could trade some information.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** Perception, that's a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Oh, damn.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** And you actually see two sets of ears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** He's got like a... Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** So he's got four ears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Kind of sticking up from behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Soki hanging on his back or something.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Yeah, yeah, no.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** A little Ewok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** Wait, is this three Sokis in a... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:44 - 00:50:14]** sorry that was too good you actually noticed there's two more Yosokis kind of hiding behind the car two more oh my god wow two more wait wait is that it there's just the four of these guys but only Jack notices Thaddeus just said is that it the guy who was knocked out twice in the same fight no no I mean that was the wrong I didn't mean that officers do have to have a certain level of confidence in everything they do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** So like I said, you guys can leave now, get off planet, and we'll never ever think about it again.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** Or we'll have to make this go away ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:26]** How about we take a middle road?

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:32]** We can give you some information about Riddle and you can give us some information about your boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:37]** You might not believe this, but we're not here to hurt your boss.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** We have a proposition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** Oh, man.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:44]** That sounds quite suspicious if I don't say so myself.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** You don't know anything about us.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** What the hell?

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** This guy's talking about killing our boss?

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** Dotrulu ain't gonna like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** Your friend, in spite of the fact that he has very big ears, is hard of hearing.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:59]** Can Kelly roll a bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:04]** I'll roll a bluff.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** You're not bluffing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** I was trying to bluff.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** You can bluff for me if you want, if you want to come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Dude, you're the person bluffing.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** You just went out there, so I think you should be the one to roll it, if Kev allows it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** I'll let you roll a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** That's like a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Yeah, that doesn't work.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** So what did you say to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:33]** I said, look, we have a proposition for your boss.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** Perhaps something that could be mutually beneficial.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:42]** And in exchange, we can give you some information about that little junk manga that you were talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Your little holdout.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:48]** It would also be good to know, why do you care about Riddle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** That ain't none of your business.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** This is our turf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:57]** You keep repeating yourself like a broken record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** She's the only one holding out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** It could be our business.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** It could be... Tormadin, please, let the hill be sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** Unless you're going to hand it over right now, we ain't got nothing to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Well, if we do hand her over, what will you do?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** We're going to take her and that's it.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** We'd like a little bit more than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Who are you to negotiate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Who are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Especially you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** We knocked you down twice, man.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** You ain't got nothing on us.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** I see you're missing out on an opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** I think you ran with your tail between your legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:31]** Jack says, and he flares out his petals and his tendrils to make himself look really, really big.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** And says, you guys are messing with the wrong crew.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** It's not just us around here.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** You better start running.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** Trying to intimidate the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** I only see four of you.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** And I know one of you ain't that tough.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Oh!

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** And I know one of you ain't that tough.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Say things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** Try to reason with these morons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:07]** I just do want to point out, you guys did kind of reveal that Dotrulu is a target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** I didn't reveal that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** We didn't say that.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:14]** Or maybe not a target, that you are interested in speaking to Dotrulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** We want to talk to your bosses.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** I don't know his name.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** I don't care.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** I don't deal with f***ing peasants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:27]** I don't see that as being a huge issue, but apparently it is.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** I rolled a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:33]** Wait, Tormadin, you should move back because you were five feet back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** All right.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Torme rolled a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** I got to roll.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** I'm going to roll my new Raven and Riddle dice.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:39]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** I'm using my Raven and Riddle dice as well.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Chuck got a 12.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Chuck got 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Rulu got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:48]** Same.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** So what's your initiative modifier?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Is that how we determine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Oh, you also got a 19, Thaddeus?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Yeah.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Yes.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** It's Dex.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Whoever has the higher modifier.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Mine's plus three.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Mine's... Well, you take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Okay.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** Sorry, what did you say you got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Rolo got a 19.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:11]** Thaddeus also got a 19, but Thaddeus has a lower... 19.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Initiative bonus.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Dex.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Or Dex bonus.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:23]** I'm going to give Thaddeus a 19.1 on my Excel spreadsheet so that I can...

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Sort it properly.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Data.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** Sort.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:39]** So given that, Thaddeus, you get a 19.1, and you go first.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** I will say that you guys... Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Rolo goes first, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** You said Rolo has a higher initiative.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Okay, sorry.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** My bad, my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** You can also just put it as 18 if no one else is 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** Shut up, John.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Don't tell me how to work.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** I'm just giving you thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Once a GM, always a GM, yeah?

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Yeah, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** John has a hard time letting go.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:04]** So it is Rolu that goes first.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:11]** And I will tell you guys that you managed to stop a surprise round with that perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Nice.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** A little behind the curtains there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** Okay, so whose turn is it, sir?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** It's yours, man.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Pay attention, John.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Dude, I'm paying attention.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** I'm just thinking about what to do.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:27]** And also, sorry, the bath is running behind me, which I think is like really just a low, higher noise floor here.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:30]** So I was hoping I wasn't first, so that could end soon.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:38]** I think the first thing Rolo's going to do is he's going to... Rolo's going to say...

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** We've got another shot at this.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** Let's try and employ some strategy.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:55]** And then he is going to move and he's going to move to get behind cover and take a shot.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:03]** I think he's going to move up to here and he's got his rifle out.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:07]** So he's just going to immediately start to run slide.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** What's up, Benny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** A mechanical question.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** If Chuck is riding on his shoulder, would I also move there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Oh, I didn't know that.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Oh, man, I don't know how that works.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** Where would that even be covered in the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** It's probably not.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** It's a DM call.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Excuse me, GM call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** GM's decision.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:33]** I'm going to say that if you are riding on his shoulder, you lose a move action because you're going to take a move action to stay held on.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Does that make sense?

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** That's fair.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** I don't know.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** It seems a little inappropriate if you're moving at light speed if he moves at the same time that you move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:48]** I'm just thinking about what is the equivalent to mounted combat in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** I don't know enough about mounted combat in general to argue.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** Mounted combat is pretty cool.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** That's my ruling.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** You use your move action to stay with him.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** Quick, decisive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** I like it.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:01]** Let me just confirm that I have... Do I have a base attack bonus?


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:13]** I don't have a base attack bonus, so I can't move and draw a weapon because I was going to draw my tactical spear at the same time.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:21]** Since I'm Kasathan, I can hold both, and Tormadin, you also can hold two weapons at the same time, or two two-handed weapons.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** I can hold four because I have four arms.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** Right, or four one-handed weapons or two two-handed weapons.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** Yeah, and so I have two two-handed weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Can you hold a spear?

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:41]** I don't even know if this is addressed, but is it two hands on one side to be a two-handed weapon, or do you have to be cross-armed to be a two-handed weapon?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** I don't know.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** But the point is I can't.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Does that matter?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Yeah.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** I think it's fine.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** I think he's going to run.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:54]** And then I think he's going to take shot and aim at the, uh, Hilkey who is right here.

**[00:57:54 - 00:58:00]** Just going to try and shoot them and hit right from the get go.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Take them out.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:10]** Take a shot with the azimuth serpent laser aims down the barrel of the rifle and

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:18]** Boy, that's an 18 against EAC on the far Hilkey down the alley.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Just pinged.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Pinged him.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Pinged him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Thank you, Excel.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:30]** They just gave me, like, graphs of all the data that I have in here, like KAC and stuff for all the characters.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Anyways, so you did hit.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Wait, what did you roll?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** 18.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** 18.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** That's a hit.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Yes.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Okay.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** Aims down the line.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Shoots at him.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:46]** It's going to be only four points of damage on that Hilki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:50]** All right, can you click just one time to let me know which hook you... The far one down the alley.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** Weren't you listening, Kev?

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** I'm trying to do 14 things at once.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** GMing is hard, man.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** Dude, it's so hard.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Come on, you act like it's hard.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** Okay, so if you take a point... I just pinged him three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:04]** I just want to double check this soft cover rule here.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:08]** Oh my gosh, there's no soft cover in this situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** I'm pretty sure it says you pick a corner...

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:18]** And you run a straight line, and if it crosses through any borders of another character, that's soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:25]** Look, that does not cross through anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** Okay, now go to the next stop.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** You have to go to all four corners of the enemy.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** You pick one corner of yours and go through all four corners of the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** Does it say it has to be all four corners?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** I'm pretty sure.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Do you want to double check this, John?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** I do.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** I do.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Because you know what?

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** I'm going to rules you.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** I'm going to rules lawyer you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** That's Transformers.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** I don't know that.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** Man, I don't know where it's at in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** It's also the crossfire thing.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Crossfire.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** Crossfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:03]** Choose a corner of your square, if any line from this corner to any corner of the target square.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** So it has to be any corner of the target square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** So you pick one corner of your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Yes.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** And if any of them cross through, then it's soft cover.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:11]** Then yes.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Technically, you get soft cover.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** All right.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:20]** So you're going to tell me it doesn't hit and it wildly shoots the sand.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** What did you roll again?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** No, it still hits.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Dude, all of that.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** I dare you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** All right, so I just wanted to make sure you were hitting the right one.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** So you're going to take four points off of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]** Four points of fire damage from the azimuth serpent.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** Well, he put on that sunblock, so he doesn't take the fire damage.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** He's starting to heat up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** This day's starting to heat up, Pilkey.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Which one did you attack, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** That's my turn.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** That is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** The far one.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Okay, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Yeah, that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]** All right, so now Thaddeus was the other one that rolled 19, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** It is now your turn.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Can we just, I just want to clarify how much health you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** I have full stamina.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** I'm down two hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** And you burned both healing serums already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** No.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Yeah.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** We burned two.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** We have two more.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Yeah, we have two more.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** We have two more.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** Sorry.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** As far as the new ones go, we haven't burned them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:29]** We have two more, and we have my Stabilize spell and my Blessings of Youth spell, which will give you stamina points.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** So it can try and save you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Fantastic.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Thank you.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:39]** Just checking the range on my weapon, GM Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Are you 40 feet out?

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** I can't do math in my head.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** Can't do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** 5, 10, 15.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Yeah, definitely.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** I can get you.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** There's no cover from here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** That's 45.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** He would be behind low cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** Low cover?

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** This boy right here?

**[01:01:59 - 01:01:59]** That bad boy?

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Oh, what?

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** 5, 10, 15.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** I don't think straight across.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Dude, there's no cover, man.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** Dude, there's no cover.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:07]** There's no cover.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Show that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** After all the stuff you pulled.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** It's on the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]** Yeah, there's a car between you and the rat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:21]** There's a corner of a car partially blocking a tenth of the freaking line.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** It's a full square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** The car is a full square.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** No, the car is in half the square.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** It talks about the borders of the vehicles.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** And he's standing over the car.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** It's not like a huge van.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:34]** He is a three foot tall mouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** No, this is the human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:40]** What is this right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** What is this thing here?

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Kev?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:42]** Kev?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** I'm looking at the map.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** What is this thing here?

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** I don't know.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** That's junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:52]** Rules for cover dictate if the player, whichever character is closer to the cover, gets the bonus for cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:56]** Right, and he was pointing at the Yusuke, and then he just moved up, and now he's 40 away from this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** No, my bad.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** I was pointing at the Yusuke.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:01]** I was taking measurements for a bunch of different places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** I just see a purple dot or purple star or purple arrow.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** That's Kelly right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** No, that's me.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Yeah, I was trying.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:11]** So Kelly just moved up and now he is behind cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** And who is he shooting at?

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:15]** I'm going to shoot at this pilkey right here.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** Okay.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Because that's the one that you hit, right, John?

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Yeah.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Okay, cool.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** He just wants to get rid of these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** You can hit that guy with no cover.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Fantastic.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** All right.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Maybe if you guys knew your rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Wow.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Wow.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** Amazing.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** All right.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Please roll well this time.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** That clip is going to be my thing for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Maybe if you knew your rules.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Maybe if you knew your rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Maybe if you knew your rules.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** We need that as a drop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** All right.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:51]** So you shot Thaddeus rolls and 11 to hit, which is not going to hit, I'm guessing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Is it KC or EAC?

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** And it actually matters at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** Who drew a bunch of stuff?

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** That was me.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Sorry.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Is it EAC or KC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** That's KAC, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** If you're shooting a projectile, then it's KAC.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** That does not.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** That doesn't hit?

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** Dude.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** No.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** That is a sad, I guess.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** You want to argue again?

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:16]** Nope.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** You guys want to?

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Let's keep rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Let's keep roll-ooing.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:27]** Speaking of roll-oo, I think it is now Grego's turn.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** Who's Grego?

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:34]** He's the one that got hurt pretty bad last time and the one that stepped forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** The first one to die this time.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** The first volunteer.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** First volunteer.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** The one who dragged his bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:41]** He's going to step forward.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** Yeah, that was your mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** Big mistake, pal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:51]** He's going to swing his baton at your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** This is not fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:55]** Heads up.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:59]** That's an 11 plus 6 for a total of 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:06]** A total of 17 against KAC to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Dang, that's pretty impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** You have a plus 6 to your melee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Did I say that out loud?

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:14]** No, I meant he rolled a 17 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** He rolled a 17 total.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Yes, that hits my KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** All right, so that hits your KAC and you're dead instantly.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** So it's all good.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Moving on to the next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** This is going to be a really short campaign.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Yeah, it's a 1d4.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** That's a 4 on the dice, plus 3 for damage.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** Total of 7 points of damage to Rolu.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** Okay.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:37]** Jeez, man.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** What happens... I'm just curious about this mounting thing.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** We should probably look into it.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:45]** But, like, if Rolu goes down, what is the status of...

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:50]** Do you have to take, like, an action to not go down as well and, like, land on your feet?

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:55]** Or does Rollo kind of land on Chuck, giving him some kind of blunt force?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:55 - 01:06:01]** Yeah, so, like, in 5e, it's typically, like, a dexterity save each time your mount gets hit.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:08]** So, like, I just rolled for myself a 20 for Dex to stay on his shoulder after he got hit.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:09]** So, like...

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** That's sort of what I imagine.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** He'll make a dexterity check every time whoever he's riding gets hit.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:20]** If they go down, they'll have to make another dexterity save to see if he falls prone too or if he's underneath or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** I like it.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:27]** I will have to take some time off air to look into this and make sure we're doing it right.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** I imagine Pathfinder has some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** Let's keep going.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:39]** Rolo gets hit and it is now Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:47]** Okay, Termay is going to attempt to intimidate this guy here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:51]** A little bit of emotional damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:54]** Emotional damage.

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:00]** We probably... I'll pull that drop before the next episode.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:09]** And he's going to move up slightly and just an earshot of everyone and be like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:15]** I thought I told you that we went easy on you last time, peasant.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** We are going to destroy you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]** As he casts Summon Creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** All right.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:38]** And beneath his feet, behind him, trembles the earth, and slowly a mound of amorphous earthen dust

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]** An earthen creature.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]** Trying to look it up.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** A sand monster?

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:50]** Basically a... Shai-Halud.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]** No, an earth elemental.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:54]** The great sand monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:54]** Amazing.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:57]** An earth elemental comes up behind him.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:01]** So you need to first roll the intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** Man, hold on.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]** I got to find an earth elemental character to drop onto the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:11]** And I rolled a 16 plus 7 for a 23 on my intimidation.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** That's pretty great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:19]** So you're casting, which is a standard action, and intimidation will give you for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:22]** And then you took a, you moved.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:24]** And you moved?

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Okay, I don't need to move.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:30]** No, I mean, I think the move was, I don't think that impacts it.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** You still have a move action after you cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:32]** Yeah.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]** Make a save to not pee your pants.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:42]** Hold on, let me pull your earth elemental creature.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:46]** Oh man, that one was cute.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** I like the cute one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** But it's tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** It's a level one earth elemental.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:59]** We're going to go see the Statue of Liberty, but the tiny one in Vegas and not the one in New York.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** So where did you cast this thing at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]** Behind him, in between him and the Ahsoka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:08]** Do you have to have a line of sight for that or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:10]** It does not say or specify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Okay.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:18]** I don't trust anything you guys say anymore.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** All right.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** So you cast the elemental.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** Yeah.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** That is your turn.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** Does the elemental get to move on this turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** It gets to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:25]** Yes.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** Okay.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** And who are you trying to intimidate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** The dude who stepped up.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** Yeah, the one who was burned before, Graco.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:37]** The dude who didn't take his freaking medicine well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:37]** Yeah.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** I mean, he's fine.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:40]** Is he?

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:44]** He went down, bounced back up, and was ready to fight again.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:47]** So what does intimidate go against?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:52]** So intimidation works either one of two ways.

**[01:09:54 - 01:10:00]** According to demoralize is what I'm trying to do.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Demoralize.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:09]** As a standard action, you can use intimidate as a creature within 30 feet to become shaken for a number of rounds.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:24]** The sense dependent ability of the DC of this check is equal to 10 plus your opponent's total intimidate skill bonus or 15 plus 1 minus 1 half times the creature's CR, whichever is greater.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:27]** If you succeed, the target is shaken for one round.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** Duration increases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:34]** 15 plus one half of the CR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** One thing, sorry, just from the beginning.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:38]** If you're going to do this, you can't do that.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** And cast.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** Yeah.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Because that is an action?

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:45]** Well, because that's your standard action.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:45]** Right.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]** I think you should stick with the casting personally, but it's up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** I'm just going to see if I can do something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:59]** It's one of those things that a skill check... If you're just trying to intimidate to change their... Bully?

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:01]** Their attitude towards you, I would allow it.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:06]** But if you're trying to do any kind of impact to apply a condition... Whatever.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Then I just do it for flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:10]** You want to make this less fun?

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** I'm just... No, no, no.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:15]** I mean, you just can't do that and cast a spell.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** I don't think that's less fun.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** I think that's just what it is.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:21]** So I think it was already cool with the earth elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:21]** What did you roll?

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** Well, I'm not doing it anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]** Well, so you roll the intimidate.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:27]** It might change their opinion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** 17 plus.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** So I'm sorry.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:32]** It's 23, 23, 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** Yeah, that doesn't.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]** I'm just going to mark this down in my book.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:39]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** Yeah, that definitely intimidates him.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:44]** So he just took a swing at Rolu and hit him real good.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:49]** He got max hits on him, and then he sees this thing pop up behind him, and he's a little overwhelmed.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:55]** But there's three other guys here that he's got with him, and so he's not quite shaking from that.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:00]** Now it's going to roll to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:01]** Yes.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:02]** He gets to attack.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** Oh, the creature rolls to attack.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:03]** Yes.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:08]** Just like the... And it gets a... You're on earth, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:10]** I am on ground?

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:11]** Okay.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:20]** So I get a plus one to both my attack as well as damage.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:20]** Nice.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:23]** Because you're touching a solid surface such as a planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** Unless you're airborne.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:27]** Are you airborne?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** I might be.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:29]** Hold on.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:31]** Let me do a jump check.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:32]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:33]** No, I'm not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** All right.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** What's your roll?

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** Oh, crack die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** What are you rolling?

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:42]** Can I ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:45]** I am rolling my cool, cool.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:48]** I don't know.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** Gold speckled die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** What type?

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:51]** What?

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** What die are you rolling?

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** Not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Oh, for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** I love dice as much as anybody else.

**[01:12:56 - 01:13:00]** But like, yeah, I'm worried about like, I don't want you to do a do a Kelly and roll.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** I got a twenty two.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** You got 22 of damage?

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** No, no, no.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Oh, to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** To hit, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** Okay.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Is your elemental technically flanking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** No.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** You have to be completely opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:15]** Got it.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** What?

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** I don't know.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** I think so.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** You have to be opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:23]** I feel like I should check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:23]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:26]** We're all like... As we all pull out our books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:29]** I think it has to be directly across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:34]** I think you're right, too, but I just really want to force things into us figuring it out.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** Is this opposite border or opposite corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** Yep.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:43]** They can draw a line to each other that passes through opposite sides of the enemy.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** So, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** So you rolled a 27.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:46]** 22.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:47]** 22 to hit.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** That hits.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:54]** So that hits, and how much damage are you doing, Will?

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** Let me roll that.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** Slam from the elemental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:05]** That's a five on the die for 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:07]** WTF, mate.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:09]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** Yes.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:19]** Whatever will create some other side character, side, I don't know, animal thing, it's always the best.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** Yeah.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Agreed.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:22]** Whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** And then he's going to burrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:27]** Of course he can do 20 million.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:28]** No, I'm not going to allow that.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:30]** Is that a move action or a stand-up action?


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:30]** It's a move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:36]** Can he do a standard and or a move or both a standard and move when he first casts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:38]** It's part of his earth glide ability.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:40]** Burrowing leaves no tunnel.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:43]** It's just a special ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:44]** Okay.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:50]** Yeah, I mean, as long as it doesn't... It's not like a... As long as he has the action for it, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:55]** When a creature burrows, it doesn't say what type of action it is.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:59]** So it's listed along blind sense, dark vision...

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:04]** I'm assuming it's just a natural ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:08]** We'll let it burrow, but it's stuck underground for the next 15 turns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** No, it can come up whenever it wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** Until you kill it.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:15]** All right, and now it's Choc's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:17]** So you took the 11 points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:19]** Yes, I took 11 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** How did it feel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:21]** None of your business.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:22]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:23]** Love it.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:46]** um chak used his move action to stay on the cop's shoulder and is going to use his standard action to whip out that big old hunting rifle amazing and aim like point the end of the barrel right at the uh the dude adjacent to him but you don't get to fire though is that an ao to pull it out no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** No, just shoot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:50]** I don't have the turn economy.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** I don't have the action to fire it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:52]** Okay, got it.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:53]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** See, I like Vinny because he plays by the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:59]** I literally read you all the rules for like 20 minutes.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:01]** Will also played by the rules.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** You just questioned him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:05]** All right, so that is the end of your guys' turns.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:08]** And now it's their turn.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:10]** Let's go.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:15]** But we're going to see what happens next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:17]** I got to add our theme to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:23]** That dog ate every smack of that avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:25]** I need more fuel in my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:25]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:27]** I always need fuel.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:32]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:38]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
