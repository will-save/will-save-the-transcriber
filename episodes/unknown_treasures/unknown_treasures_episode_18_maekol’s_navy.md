**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:03]** Welcome back to Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Orthology.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** Kelly playing Thaddeus.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:17]** And Vinny playing Chuck.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:20]** I had to just say all that just to remind myself because I have a crap memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** That was for you, not for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** It was just for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** He's got a goldfish memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Welcome back, though.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Thank you.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Thank you.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:33]** Hope everyone's will save Wednesday is going mighty fine or whatever day you might be listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** Yeah.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** If you're listening midweek, we hope that we're recharging you, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** What, what if they're listening on the weekend?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** Yeah.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:47]** Then we hope you are relaxing and unwinding and cuddling in your like bed while listening to us.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:56]** Wait, that sounds like a, maybe both of you, you and your significant other or headphones and listening to the kind of podcast for that.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** I mean, do you get in the fetal position?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** Do you just get into the fetal position and cry and listen to Will Save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Yeah.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** As the theme plays, you just sob uncontrollably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's what I do.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** I just didn't want to assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** That's because you're editing it, so it's a lot worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** That's true.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I sob while editing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:22]** Maybe you're on a long flight right now, and there's some person next to you that's really annoying, and so you turned us on.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Whatever the reason is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:29]** I listen to my podcast when I'm driving somewhere, when I'm doing the dishes.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:35]** I try to listen while I'm doing the lawn, but the lawnmower is too loud, so I just end up listening to crappy music.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** And then the other time I try to listen is during work.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** I will put it on...

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:45]** but I ended up having to like pause and rewind constantly.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** So I'll get through one episode over an entire work day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:52]** So that's like, I don't get how you can work with words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** I can't.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** That's the problem.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:57]** It's like, I'm trying to do both and I'm like, but one of them is priority.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:02]** So I, I stopped, I stopped the podcast until I have something that I can, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** I feel like my brain can't process all of that.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:08]** Like my language and the language I'm reading and the language I'm listening to all at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:38]** I don't try to do that often that's like if you know if you guys like hey listen to this episode we need to know if we should keep in this part because we're going to cut out everything because the stuff that gets cut out tell you it's so good if you could hear it you really would be in the people yeah we'll start a patreon you could pay for the pain if you want to listen to that pay for the pain it's the highest tier that's the only reason that we start a patreon welcome to the suck

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:44]** It's just a bunch of silence and us and us arguing over rules.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** And us going, uh.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Oh, man.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:54]** We should just take everything that we cut out, Benny, and put it into its own track and bounce it separately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** Call it the sausage track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** It's just horrible.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** It's just bad.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Sausage track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** We could put it over some lo-fi beats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** It's kind of soothing.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Put some vinyl on it.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** We slow it down.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** It's like, cut this.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** And in the background, it's like, cut this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:18]** Yeah, it's like, and then like, you know, like clicks.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** And then you'll hear like a chair creak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:38]** uh-huh yeah hold on we gotta stop i can't uh-uh guys guys i'm taking a bye rick be right back oh yeah exactly yep god how are we gonna survive video the glamour of podcasting we're gonna make it we'll make it work we're gonna become more professional


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** We're just going to have the standby technical issues the entire episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Not use Snapchat filters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Will has been cycling through Snapchat filters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Will's done like hundreds of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Yeah, I mean, Shrek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Yeah, he was Shrek.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** He was a jacked potato.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** He was a jacked puff pastry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** He was a banana when he was doing rules.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Oh, yeah, that was cool.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** He was a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** I was mostly this, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** He was mostly the smile which we shared last week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** He's Cheshire Seth Rogen.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Cheshire Seth Rogen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:22]** I was replying to somebody on Twitter and I throw up GIFs all the time and the one that came across, it was just a GIF of a cat

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:30]** With a pirate costume on, but like the pirate, it's where the legs, like the cat's front legs are the feet of the costume.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** And then there's just like fake arms.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:39]** And so it's just like as a cat saunters into the room on all four legs, it looks like a little pirate cat walking.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Yeah, the pirate cat.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** And I just, the whole time I was thinking was like, this is Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** Oh, that's sweet.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** You should have tagged it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** I think it's also sweet that that's the first time you've seen that.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** No, I've seen it a million times, but now I'm like, wait a minute.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** Now you associate it with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** All right, that's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** And I know that cat's hiding dead bodies in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Yeah, honestly.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Dead mice attached to its back and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Okay.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** So this is, I, I am very curious.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** I'm the GM.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** It doesn't count.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:17]** Cause like all my character creation comes from the book.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:22]** I want to know, like, where did you guys pull your inspiration for these four?

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** I love these four characters.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** I love them.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** And we'll start with Kelly.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:32]** Cause we were talking about, you know, Thaddeus and, and let's not forget like the creepy collecting body parts.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** We can't forget that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** And like experiments.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** What is the inspiration for Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:44]** Well, Thaddeus, it's not 100%, but the main thing for Thaddeus was- Hannibal Lecter?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** No, come on.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:56]** I think, like, Shere Khan as portrayed in Tailspin specifically, which is different than Shere Khan.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Will was like, ooh.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** He was like, oh, wait a minute, not Tailspin.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** He's looking for the Shere Khan.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** I love Tailspin.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Okay, so Tailspin.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** Yeah, the reason being that, like.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Can you explain Tailspin for people that might not know?

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** All right, so Tailspin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Yeah, some of our listeners probably never even heard of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** All right, so here's the deal, all right?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:18]** So back in, like, the late 80s, early 90s, the best kids' cartoons ever, until the recent renaissance.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** There's some new good ones these days.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** But in the West, like, the best ones ever happened at that time, and there was DuckTales, Tailspin, you know, Chippendale Rescue Rangers.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Chippendale, yeah.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:34]** Tailspin is Baloo from the Jungle Book, and he's, like, a pilot.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** And then, like, Shere Khan runs this, like, huge, like,

**[00:07:36 - 00:08:05]** like massive like corporation and there's also pirates in it by the way like flying yeah they're they're flying pirates they're not space pirates because they're still like in the atmosphere but like they're they all airships yeah but shere khan like hides a lot of his vicious you see his viciousness come out every now and again but he tries to hide it under a layer of stability in that passive aggressive and that's basically that yes he's trying to not at any point to rage out and like murder someone in the face basically got it that's where it goes awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:14]** We talked about Quantum Leap before, but there's a joke that Baloo is the Quantum Leap of Disney.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:20]** It's the same bear in Jungle Book, Robin Hood, and Tailspin.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** I think there's a couple other things.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** Wherever there's a bear that appears in Disney, it's the same bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** This is all coming together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** He's the Sam Beckett.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** That's the name of the person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Sam Baloo Beckett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Sam Blue Beckett.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Let's go.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** Let's do those goes.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Who's going to go next?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** I missed that.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I blinked.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** I think it was me.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** Vinny, where does Choc come from?

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** I feel like I know this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** You do.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:57]** Chuck is shamelessly ripped from Pirates of the Caribbean.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:02]** The tiny monkey that rides on... Who's the first captain?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** The dude that's piloting the Black Pearl in the first movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** It's Barbossa, isn't it?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Yes, Captain Barbossa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** So Captain Barbossa's monkey, Jack.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** And when Jack... Way to go, Jack.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** And Jack Sparrow climbs on.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** He's like, no, we named the monkey Jack.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** So all of those slapstick substitutionary humor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** I designed, I drew up your, your illustrations.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** I think we posted those a couple of weeks ago.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** Yeah.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** And, and I Googled Jack.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:42]** I didn't know what else to Google, but I would like Google Jack from pirates of the Caribbean.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** And then Jack Sparrow would show up and I was like, that's not what I mean.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** But yeah.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Amazing.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:49]** Thank you.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Will,

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** I feel like you always have such a deep...

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:00]** It's like root to your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** I don't have deep root anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Always.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:07]** The roots for your characters go 15 feet underground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** No, this is all hearsay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** It's not admissible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:18]** The best part is his Snapchat filter right now is a growing nose.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** And as he said that, it wasn't showing.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** And he's like, that's not true.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** And his nose is spreading out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** Oh, the timing.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** If only I had based my character on Pinocchio.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:43]** Treme, while his name comes from a mashup of ancient folklore and gods, terms being the Etruscan,

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:50]** sort of equivalent of the Roman god Mercury, which is also Hermes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** So, there you go.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Hermodex.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Hermodex.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** The Etruscans are an often overlooked group of people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** Yes, they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** It's very cool, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:11]** Yeah, I mean, like, the basis of his character, I guess, is more of... I'm trying to play into the sort of witch word paradigm of...

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** secretive and elusive traitors.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Not traitors.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Traitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** Traitors.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** That's good.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** Witch words are so mysterious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** And you're doing a fantastic job of it.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Like I said, I love all of these characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:40]** And part of his role, too, on the ship as yeoman chief is sort of like...

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:54]** the messenger between the captain and not messenger per se, I guess that would be like first mate or like maybe, maybe the cob, but in some, some way he has a close relationship.

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:01]** So it's almost like terms being a messenger between people and gods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:06]** Oh, I feel like a lot of people on the ship rely on Jermaine for a lot of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** To happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Mostly for their pay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** I guess part of it.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Their pay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** The pay is late.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Thank you for that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** But it's never late, so it's fine.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** The depth that you put into all your characters is so amazing and I love it.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** It's always interesting.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:34]** Well, just for the listeners, you guys heard episode one, we talked about the captain.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** I gave a blanket assignment to Will.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:42]** I was like, hey, I'm going to just ask you to describe the captain.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** And it was mostly to be a, what do they call it, a MacGuffin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** A red herring, yeah.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** It was supposed to be a distraction.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:59]** And Will came back with so many questions about like, you know, well, what kind of captain?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:05]** And like, the character he built is so evolved.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** And I was like, man, I just wanted to create a voice and a name.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** He can't ask me to do that.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:19]** He's definitely not based off of Goldie Horn, a real pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Full-fledged character.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** John, we should bring him.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Anyways, John.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Noted.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Tell us a little bit more about Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:35]** I'm going to pass the torch over to Kelly on this one.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I want to know a little bit more.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** You're punting this one?

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Oh, no.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:49]** Look, I'm happy to talk a little bit about my Rolu after he was like how I started to pull Rolu into a full character, but I'm curious where Rolu came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** You're going to be so disappointed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:55]** Wait, because Rollo's not technically John's character.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** Rollo is a character that Kelly created.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:02]** I just wanted to make one quick correction, though, when I just said Goldhorn.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:08]** Goldie Horn is not, I don't know of any, Hornigold, Benjamin Hornigold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Hornigold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Ah, yes.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Goldie Horn was a pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Classic mix-up.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:19]** That was looking for the right ship, but the first ship that she got on was too small, and the second ship she got on was too big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** The third one was just right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** The third one was just right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Oh.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** And all three of them had sh**ty porridge, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Yeah, that's all they served.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** And what a terrible grog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Yeah, horrible grog.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** And no oranges or any citrus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Yeah, so... Lots of scurvy.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Lots of scurvy.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Anyway, Kelly.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** John, yeah, we're going to skip John on this one and go back to Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:51]** We're going to go back to John in a second because, to be honest, I needed someone, I needed a friend of yours to, like, die, basically.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** So that was, like, what happened in the main campaign.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** All right.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** I needed a motivation for you.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** You're telling me this now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:03]** The fun thing is, like, that's who, like, I was a background.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Yeah, spoiler alert, spoiler alert.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** I was a background actor in Hollywood for a little while.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** And like, that was my goal was just to be like, I want an IMDB.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:16]** I like, that's my entry is just like the red shirt from episode four.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** I just want that cool, like death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** And that's what instead he started as a young Ron.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** He started as a young Ron Howard.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** But we need to have a show.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:34]** So, basically, Rollu came entirely from my own internal universe of characters.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** He's not inspired by anyone in particular.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:42]** All the credit for Rollu's character goes to John for acting him out and fleshing him out, particularly in this campaign.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** I only wrote Rollu's lines in the original thing in our main campaign.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** That was it.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Nothing else, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:57]** Before we jump back to John to explain the rest, does that mean that Rolu is like an aspect of you or a character?

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** Does it take on a personality from somebody in your life?

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Yeah.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** As we talked about last week, you can decline if you want to.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** We know this is a deep topic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** I haven't thought about that, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** How come I'm always hearing about this declining after I've already gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** I told you that.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** I just didn't hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:22]** I'm sorry, James or Jonathan or whatever the hell his name was said it to you.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** That's so good.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** I know that I always write stories and I know a lot of people write stories.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:36]** I've written a few stories where the main character is usually some embodiment of myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** I could see Hears being somewhat like me, but not like Rolu.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:46]** I guess that if Hears is like me to a degree, then Rolu would be the friends that I would want to have around me.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:51]** And I probably do have friends like that, so he might take some inspiration from them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:59]** So Kelly is a space pirate, but a benevolent space pirate.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** He's mixed.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:04]** And his friends are good pirates too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** He's basically a, what is he?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** He's like lawful neutral.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:14]** He's like a Benjamin Hornigold of pirates, right?

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** Goldhorn.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Goldhorn.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:17]** All right.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:26]** So, John, what life did you blow into the balloon that Kelly gave you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** I'm actually really bad at blowing up balloons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:35]** Some soggy balloon thing.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** By the way, he's dead.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Here you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** The neighborhood kids, right?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:46]** Like I live in a neighborhood with like a lot of children and my son's only like two.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** So he's always just watching the other kids.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:57]** But like we went down the street and they were playing water balloons and the technology these days, they buy their balloons from Costco and

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:05]** You just screw it onto the end of your hose, and you turn your hose on, and you have 20 balloons fill up.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:11]** And you just shake them into a bucket, and they're already sealed because each balloon is on a tube of its own with a rubber band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:16]** Have you seen the reusable water balloons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** No.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** That sounds terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** How does that even work?

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** It's like a clamshell, and it seals around it.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** This one's hard.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** That's awesome.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:31]** No, it's flexible still, but it's got this, I don't know, ring.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** And I guess it's reusable.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** So I think it actually detonates better, right?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:46]** Because as a kid, I would always throw, if you're in a water balloon fight, you have a few duds, they bounce off people and they don't burst.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** They just slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:51]** There's a sweet spot where if you throw it too hard, it pops in your hand.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:55]** If you don't throw it hard enough, it just fishes right on the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** You've got to throw it just right.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** And they raise their super soaker at you and you're f***ed at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:09]** Have you guys seen the new water pistols that are... They fire like bullets.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** I didn't mean to sidetrack us.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** You totally sidetracked us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** Look, I'll just say this about Rolu.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** I...

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:40]** didn't have a lot to work with other than being sorry no no no no that that's not a fatigue that's a that's just a like that was the status of rolo in the beginning that's okay i'm just disappointed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:45]** Rolu was an empty husk of a character completely uninspired by when I got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** No, no, no.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:57]** What I'm trying to say is that the single defining action of Rolu was that Rolu sacrificed a lot to come meet Piers, right?

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** So the thing is, is that...

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:14]** that action alone and then ultimately paid the ultimate price spoiler if you haven't listened to episode one of also sorry no it's okay you should you should yeah but so what i thought was who does that who

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:42]** does that especially for a kasathan who loves uh i mean because kasathans are adventurers but they also have a certain side of them that's that they love their tradition and their culture and their home and i just thought well if rolu was willing to do this then i just wanted to explore the idea of what do you do when you have a kasathan who maybe doesn't have a home

**[00:20:42 - 00:21:09]** in the conventional sense okay until you get to here's so okay so here's this is news in yeah this is news to kelly like kelly created this character but like john developed yeah he did that was really good now we're gonna see we'll see what happens there's plenty of game left right kev


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** There's a little bit of game left.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Let's talk about that game.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Let's play.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Let's play.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Let's play.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Seamless transition.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Here we go.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Back to the map.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Here we go.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Here we go.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** So last week, you continue to fight the warriors.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** The true warriors.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Sorry.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** True warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Here we go.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** There it is.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** And we can start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:39]** The two Yusokis were busy fighting K'Fox after they took some cover behind some junk that had K'Fox in them.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:44]** And the rest of you make fast work of poor Michael.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:52]** He was able to shake off the poison from Thaddeus, but he still wasn't able to hit Chak, even though he tried really, really hard.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:58]** Torme put up a good distraction by trying to trip both Michael and Tez.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:05]** And all that work, it added up very quickly and it created a huge frustration within Tez Tronin.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:20]** She stepped back slowly from the fight and then burst into a blinding light, leaving just that true warrior, Michael, to finish the fight.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** And here comes the TPK.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Let's get into it.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:28]** So I did, I just want to make a correction.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:36]** So I did say that both Yosokis died, but actually one Yosoki was still alive, but is no longer there.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** So the fallout from that blast, boom, bright light.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** The one pile is knocked over.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** One Yosuke is dead.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** One Kafak is already dead.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** The other Kafak is now dead.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** But Tez and the other Yosuke are gone.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** And you don't see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** Okay, like, is there, like, shadow outline there?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** Like, consumed by the sun, maybe?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Or, like... Roll perception.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Is there any indication that they were there before?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Roll perception.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** Roll perception.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Rolling perception.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** All of us?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** I guess so.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Whoever wants to perceive.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Whoever wants to perceive.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** What a great... I love perceiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** Do I still have a bonus for Look Alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Oh, I think you do.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** It's still within the hour, right, Kev?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:32]** Let me readjust that and say it's actually survival check.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Oh, okay.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** Survival.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Can we just roll over the rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:42]** Actually, roll... Tell me your perceptions real quick, and then I'll... What are you rolling rules for?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** You're confusing me.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** 24.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** I got a dirty 20.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** I got a 13.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Let me absorb this for half a second.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Chalk doesn't see shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:53]** Seven.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** I'll do survival roll though.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** Rough.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** And you want us to roll survival separate?

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** I rolled a 17 survival.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Oh, nice.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** After my terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** Okay, so after the perception, the perception you just see... Nothing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:14]** You see the sand is spread almost evenly from a point.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** It's very clear where Tez was standing.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** Almost like a bomb went off.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:28]** And then you also notice some footprints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Could I recall knowledge about...

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** Something like this, like life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Just give me half a second on this one.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Okay.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** So the perception checks saw that.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:48]** The survival checks show that the footprints led off down to the south and out the entryway of the car yards.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Okay.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:59]** And that you saw one set of tracks lead to another, and then two sets of tracks left the car yards is what the survival shows.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Go ahead.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:05]** Will Alone, roll me a mysticism.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Mysticism?

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, or culture.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** So what am I doing?

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** Am I recalling knowledge with mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:18]** You are using culture or mysticism.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** Can I also?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Or is it just Will?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Just Will for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** I'm going to use culture because it's a plus seven.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** And I rolled a 15 for a 22.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** 22 is definitely, um, high enough.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:39]** Uh, and you know, immediately that Tez Tronin is in fact, you guessed it.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** A Salarian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** No.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Oh, no way.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:43]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:52]** You guys all guessed it from the picture, but, but you know, you know, now for your characters now know, like, you know, Treme says like, Hey, wait a minute.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** That thing.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** She's a, she's a Salarian.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** And, and what she used was supernova, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Why would you use Supernova?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** There's Zenith powers.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Why?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Because she could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** I don't... But she... Because she wanted to.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** Blind us and run away.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** That's her ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** We also know she doesn't care about her companions.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** My God.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** She killed both... Two of them and then like ran... Left the other behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Are we still in combat?

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Just for record, she killed one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** Okay.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** All right.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Well, whatever.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** She left her bro behind.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Look at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Just...

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:48]** because i i corrected that yeah yeah yeah she left she left michael behind yeah yeah poor michael michael let's get him though so we're fighting michael right now you are still in combat with michael oh wow ah and i actually forgot who's turning no it's test is so she's gone that makes sense she's gone yes she's gone she's gone so she supernovaed and ran out

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** Yes.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Yeah.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Supernova.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Boom.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Blinding light.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** And she used that almost like a magician to disappear.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Just a little magic trick.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Okay.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** Okay.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:04]** So her and the other Yosuke darted out of there, leaving poor Michael behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Did they stop for Keflak dogs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** Yeah, that's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Yeah.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** You will have to do a survival check on your way out.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Once we talk to the Keflak dog dealer.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:18]** which I forgot his name off to go back and look.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:22]** It is now... Not their turn, not their turn.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** It's Roloo's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** It's Roloo's turn.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** I'm not expecting that.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:32]** I think Roloo is going to... Wait, what?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** It's just the initiative order.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** It's just the numbers.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** The numbers don't lie.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** Roloo's going to... You know what Roloo's going to do?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Roloo's going to ready an action.

**[00:27:44 - 00:28:07]** to shoot michael and is gonna point the azimuth serpent laser at michael and is going to say now is your opportunity take advantage of this time and surrender just a diplomacy sure

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** Well, I used my standard action to ready an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Change attitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** I actually used it to ready an action.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** So that's my...

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:20]** Because unless you let me use a move action as my diplomacy, otherwise I don't have any actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:26]** I'm going to say if you're going to try to intimidate or use diplomacy, that has to be your stamina.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** Yeah, if you're going to diploma them, you're not going to diploma or intimidate.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** You're just going to... I'm saying that.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** So you have no effect at all in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Just some flavor?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** You're not even going to allow it just to hear.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** I mean, you heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** Okay.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** You heard it, but he's dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** That's on you, Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Is it?

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** So what is your trigger for your action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:58]** If Michael attacks any of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** So Michael can't be reasoned with or intimidated?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** He can be intimidated, surely, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Well, no, no, no, no.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:11]** What we're saying is you can't actively intimidate somebody and change their...

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** Is it perception or like... Diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Change attitude.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:21]** When you interact socially with another creature, that creature has an initial attitude towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** That is a standard action, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:28]** It doesn't... I would argue that I'm not trying to change his attitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** It says when you interact socially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** Yeah.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** I'm not trying to make him like us.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** I'm just trying to get him to stop attacking us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** That's a part of changing his attitude.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** His attitude is currently to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Is his attitude currently hostile, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** He is a hostile... Yes, he is hostile currently.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** So if you want to change that... I would argue that you can be hostile and not attack.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Say that again, John?

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Do you want to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:58]** A hostile creature would rather attack you either physically or verbally than civilly converse with you.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** I didn't even have to Google that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** That's out of the book.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Okay.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Straight out of the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** Most enemies you meet are hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Rules lawyered.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** I'll be rules lawyer for you, Kev, for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Thank you.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** I appreciate that, Will.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Cool.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Agree to disagree.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** That's okay.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** There's no disagreeing here.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:18]** It is a standard action to change somebody's attitude, and he is currently hostile.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** I'm not doing a standard action.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Here's a question for the group.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** Is it hostile or hostile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** It's either, but most people say hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** I would say hostile.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** You know what's funny?

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:36]** I say hostile as in that's how my attitude towards you is, but hostile I would use as like a noun, like hostile person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** That person is a hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** Is a hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** Interesting.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** Well, he is currently a hostile.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Okay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:31:01]** It is now Vahri's turn, and they are actually going to step back behind Rolu and keep their gun trained on the true warrior, but they are also going to hold their action.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Ready or delay?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** They're going to ready because I've already moved.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Delaying is delaying your full turn.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** Readying is readying a portion of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** I mean, it still moves you in the initiative order, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** They both move you initially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:25]** You're changing the attitude of the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** No, because I'm not.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** K'fok 1 and 2 are dead.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:33]** The tough true warrior, it is now their turn.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** What does he do?

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Let me stroke my beard some more.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Stroke it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Stroke it real good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** Stroke it really good.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Stroke it fast.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** Is that Michael stroking his mutton chops?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** Yeah, Michael's stroking his mutton chops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:55]** Does he get a bonus to his AC for those mutton chops?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** Michael has incredible mutton chops.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** He has a bonus to diplomacy.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** He definitely does.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** How do you guys spell Michael?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** The normal way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** The way that God intended?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Oh, God.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** We're in the world of Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** M-Y-K-A... Oh, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** Ah, cool.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Close, close.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** I've said M-A-E-K-O-L-E.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** K-O-L.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** A-E-K-O-L.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** Okay.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** That's how you spell Michael.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** May-Cole.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** May-Cole.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** May-Cole.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** May-A-Colpa.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** Michael.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** Anyways, I'm terrible at spelling anyway, so it doesn't matter.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:36]** Michael stroking his button chops.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:41]** And he is going to do full defense.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** Total defense.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Total defense.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Total defense.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Total defense.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** Total D. And then he puts up a fence in front of himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Total defense.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:01]** So you can defend yourself as a standard action starting at beginning of this action.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:05]** You get a plus four bonus to your armor class until the start of your next turn.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:16]** You can't combine total defense with other actions that increase your AC, nor can you make attacks of opportunity while benefiting from your total defense.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** So like he said last time,

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Ah, s***.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** You guys are in a lot of trouble now.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** And he goes total defense.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** And he looks kind of... So just for the listener, he is now almost kind of surrounded.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** He has... Chak is at his feet.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Rolu is kind of in front of him.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Thaddeus... Thaddeus.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Thaddeus.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** Is off to the left a little bit with, like, beelining for him.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** And Torme has moved up behind him.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** So he's almost...

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** Three quarters of him are surrounded.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Plus there's K'Fox potentially going back that way.

**[00:33:54 - 00:34:07]** Right, so he's in trouble, but he's not giving up and he's actually going to step back once to try to just get him... He's funneling you guys...

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:35]** into a smaller area so you're not completely surrounding him and so he's gonna move back just enough to have you guys you know in a fan shape instead of a full you know surrounded smart sheet um but he he's cracking his knuckles again and kind of he's got his fist clenched and he's he's almost bracing for impact okay okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:41]** Because he's expecting her to just pop out again or whatever, even though I guess she might not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** He's expecting who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** The Salarian woman.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:52]** If he said you're in trouble now, I'm expecting he expected her to explode onto everyone or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** We'll see.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:58]** 14 warheads falling from the sky.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** And that's the end of our game.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** Thank you for playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Should I play the thing?

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Roll the credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** He's bracing for you guys.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** He's not going to give up.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:12]** He's still hostile because nobody has tried to talk him down.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** But he's left here alone.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** So that is his entire turn.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** He's stalwart.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Is that the term?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Stalwart.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** I'm making stuff up.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Moving on.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** It is Tremay's turn.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** What are you going to do, Tremay?

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** Round number 14, I think.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:36]** Do I kill this guy or do I... You killed the last one.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** You might as well kill this one, too.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** Yeah, that's from above.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** You did defy Thaddeus' orders, right?

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** That one time to, like, not kill, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Do we want to keep this one alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** I think he might be useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:55]** Thaddeus strokes his own mutton chops, and he, like, talks to Rolu.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** What do you think, Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** I think we do.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** I'll do an actual diplomacy check on my next turn.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Yes, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Well, you're delaying.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Oh, your standard action was to shoot, right?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** So you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** My ready action was to shoot, yeah.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** So it expires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** Okay.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:17]** So I'm going to say to him...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** Listen here.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Do you feel that?

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:28]** Do you feel that cold about to grip your body and arrest your life function on this hot planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** He's standing there kind of tense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** To feel the cold death grip you.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:41]** Lay down your arms or die where you stand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:46]** It is 128 degrees out here, and you're asking me if I'm cold?

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** No.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** No, I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** This guy doesn't get it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** This guy really doesn't get it.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Yeah, I'm really like... Was that a... Wait.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** I was going to try and demortalize him.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:04]** As a standard action, you can intimidate to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to become shaken for a number of rounds.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Wouldn't you need a roll for that?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Sorry, bully.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Bully.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** So what is our save for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** What's the skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:24]** Uh, the DC of this check is equal to either 10 plus your opponent's total intimidate skill bonus or 15 plus one minus one half times the opponent's CR, whichever is greater.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:29]** That's for, so I have to roll a bully check, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** Roll your, roll your bully, bully check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:39]** If you click on intimidate and you look at bully, you can intimidate to bully a creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** I can't click on intimidate because I'm using a text.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** It's page 139.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** I have 142 in the pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:52]** Yeah, so it's your charisma modifier plus whatever intimidate skill he has.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Plus 10 is the DC for will.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Wait, what?

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:07]** Will needs to make a bully check against the... Yeah, I have... So why would my intimidate bonus... So not yours, the Hilkey's... Your opponent's intimidate bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** I don't have an intimidate bonus on my... That's what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:16]** It's your charisma modifier plus any intimidate skill he has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** Okay, so I have what I need to know.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Go ahead and roll your intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** 26?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** 26?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Yeah, that passes.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I don't even know why we're in rules.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** It doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:36]** Now I do a 1D6, I believe, to see how many rounds your attitude changes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Times 10 minutes.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** 1D6 times 10, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** So 20 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** 20 minutes?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Amazing.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Okay.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:52]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** So we're intimidating him, right?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** To get him to just stand down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:02]** Yeah, or you could also change his attitude through a diplomacy check if you wanted to be good cop, bad cop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:08]** It does say you must spend at least one minute conversing with a creature to do a bully check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Yeah, I have been.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** No?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** You don't think so?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** I've been conversing with my weapons and spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** I haven't shot at you yet, but I'm itching to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** I'll give that to you.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** Thaddeus is far more intimidating than he is diplomatic, obviously.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:31]** So then he rolled an 18, and then he's like, you're out of options.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** What do you say we have a nice chat?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:39]** And then he starts to crack his knuckles and shit with his claws gleaming in the sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:42]** You can't crack your knuckles at somebody who's already cracking their knuckles.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** He's cracking his knuckles?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** Go ahead and roll that at a disadvantage.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** There's no disadvantage.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** I didn't know that was happening.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Wrong game, Kev.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:58]** Roll a knuckle crack check, I think is what Kev meant to say, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Yeah.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** All right, let's see.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:04]** I suppose that would be an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:09]** Thaddeus has just got a nail file sharpening his claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** Thaddeus just does a flip in front of him like a cat does and lands very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Lands like a superhero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Go ahead and move Thaddeus forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** And you rolled a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Yeah, it's an acrobatics check.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Look what I can do.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** It's basically one of those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** Look, dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** B is going to chalk now.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Is it chalk?

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Okay, great.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** That's awesome.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** No, no, no.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** You got that for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** We're moving on to chalk.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** It's chalk's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** Let's let the expert do this here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Chalk steps up.

**[00:40:52 - 00:41:00]** He lays what appears to be his toy hunting rifle down and says, Dude, you're alone?

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Help us help you.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:09]** You really need to get up.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** And I'm going to try diplomacy to talk him down.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Go for it.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Change attitude.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** 30 on diplomacy.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** It's a natural 20 on the die, and I have a plus 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Man.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:29]** So as you say that to him, you lay your gun down.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:39]** As you step over, one leaf or one vine lays the gun down behind you, and your other two vines and your hands kind of pop up, and you're like, come on, dude.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Help us.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Help you.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:44]** And you see him clenching his fists.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** And he kind of looks at you.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** He punches him right in the face.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** No.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:54]** He actually kind of slumps down and almost squats to you.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:06]** And he puts his hands down and kind of lays them out for you, almost invitingly, and says, I'm so sorry, little dude.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** I got you, buddy.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Chuck climbs up.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:39]** gives him a big squeeze he pulls you closer gives you a hug we have to figure out how to i mean i don't know if we could change his attitude for too long but he could be our frog so well that's the difference between diplomacy and bully yeah diplomacy actually changes his attitude right right bully is just coercion under duress so what did you change it to

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Damn it, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Close the book for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** No, we did bad cop, good cop is what we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** That was not me being a douche.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:55]** I'm going to put him in the friendly category for now because I don't feel like looking at the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** Because he went unfriendly from hostile to unfriendly.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:03]** He skipped indifferent, but he got a critical success, so friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** I'm going to say he's friendly with Chuck.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** And he's now hugging Chuck.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:12]** And he says, I'm so sorry, little dude.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** I was following orders, man.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Just doing what I was told.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Aren't we all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** You should pick better people to get your orders from.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:23]** I might know a crew you could be helpful to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Yeah, a crew that won't abandon you in the middle of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Yes, I totally agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** I don't know if I trust these other dudes.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** You're saying you're cool with them?

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** I see that you're close, but I don't know, man.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:42]** Look at it this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** We were all defending ourselves.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** Now that we have a mutual understanding, let's all be amigos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** We can go get some K'fok dogs down the way.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Yeah, we can all eat some lunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** I love me some K'fok dogs.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** That's for sure.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** So we're out of initiative order.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:12]** You guys are now on a friendly basis with this poor, tough warrior named Michael.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** Again, spelled M-A-E-K-O-L.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** He's like almost dead, isn't he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Yeah, he's on the verge of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** I'm going to hit him with my serum of healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** What?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** You punch him in the face with a healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** No explanation at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:38]** That's our last one, but I get the impression that since we're wrapping up, like from a metagaming perspective, we might go shopping soon.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Oh, maybe.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** You might get attacked by... Who knows?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:47]** So... He only gets one HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Yeah.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Oh, so he's up to...

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** He's up to three.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Tess shoots him in the head from a distance.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Oh, God.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** No.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Cool.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** So, like, what is the status here?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Are you guys up to leave?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** The K'Fox, from what you can see, are dead.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:04]** The car yard entrance is just around that corner.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** This guy's friendly with you, but he's not... He's not comfortable.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** He might join you, depending on... Yeah, he's definitely still on edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** Yeah.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:18]** Thaddeus just walks up next to him and says, let's get out of here together.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** But be careful.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** There's some more of those creatures over there.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** Hug the wall, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** What is very 13 up to?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** What are they up to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:38]** They were staying next to Rolu, and so they see this happening, but they're kind of keeping their distance because they're kind of concerned.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:43]** So you guys manage to make your way out of the car yards.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** You're pretty safe as you come around that corner, and you guys are watchful about where the fox are.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** I guess we could just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:59]** I was going to ask, Michael, are you, we're not trying to coerce you or anything.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:08]** It would be, there's an opportunity for you to leave this place, but we would like to ask you some questions.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** If you could take some time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** What do you mean by like, what do you mean this place?

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** You're talking about like Kavok Depot.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Like that's all I've ever known.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** It's kind of the armpit of the universe to be honest, Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** Just make it fun of his hometown, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:32]** It's just like Thaddeus to crap all over everything these guys ever know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** You know, I quite like it here.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** The dry climate, Michael.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:40]** I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Truly.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** External opinions notwithstanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:50]** Can I roll a diplomacy on that to maybe solidify his attitude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Yeah.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** I'm going to say you guys all move.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** Touch the, like he came with you around that corner.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Yeah.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Clearly weapons out.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:00]** Cause it could Fox are around, but like you guys make it to that front gate.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** Have you guys, are you guys still armed and, and aggressive towards him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** No, not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:13]** We're putting our weapons away, and I was going to try and... No, we're clear in the area with him, is what I would assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Okay, I just want to clarify that.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** So he's feeling more comfortable with you guys.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:24]** I think what you could do at this point is convince him possibly to join the Caduceus crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:31]** Or you could send him on his way, turn him into the locals.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** I don't... Go ahead and ask him whatever questions you want to ask him now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** Do we need to make a diplomacy check then afterwards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** Just ask your questions and we'll move on from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:47]** Is the questions we ask going to affect his willingness to join us or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** That depends on what you ask him.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Hey, man, you want to, like, give me your toe?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** And you're like, fuck you.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** You could have just said yes, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:06]** We're just trying to get a bearing, Kev, on, like, how to get this dude to... We're concerned about the well-being of everyone here at Kevok Depot and...

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** Well, what can you tell us maybe about this so-called... The situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** What's the main bad dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Do we want to directly ask?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** We had one job when we came down here.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Yeah.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** None of us can remember what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** I have a... My memory is crap.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** It wasn't the water dealer.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** It was the... Man, what was his name?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** I don't remember.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Oh, Dr. Trulio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:40]** What do you know about Dotrulu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:48]** No, that dude... You don't, you really don't, guys.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:55]** You rode through us really well, but I just can't... I can't recommend fighting that guy.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:00]** He is... He's the size of the four you put together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** We understand that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** I mean, like, he's massive.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** He's scary.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** I've only ever seen him a couple of times.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** And Tess, she's intimidating as shit.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** You've seen her.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** She's got some kind of, like, magical ability.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:20]** Like, she can actually, like, create a sword from her hand.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** I don't know why she didn't chop you guys to bits.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** There's something she wants from you.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** I'm telling you, you guys are not.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** You're on her wrong side.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** And she's Dotrulu's left hand.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** And he's got four hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** God.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** Four Jedi.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:40]** Termay's gonna be like, I see.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** With his four heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Yeah.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Rulu does a big stretch with all his hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:57]** stop showing off now it's so nice his forearms are like a lot bigger than your forearms if you know what I mean


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:21]** yes and i can tell you that we're not uh strangers to his type nor are we ill-equipped and uh hey hey like if if i if i stay here they're gonna find me they're gonna kill me and i can't do that like yes then it's better you come with us wouldn't you say yes this is why there are


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** Can I just ask, like, what are the health benefits?

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** You guys have childcare?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** You get to live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** We have an exhaustive list of benefits.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** I can forward you all the documentation.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** We can go over it step by step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** What's your paperwork's in order?

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** The ship is pretty cool.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** There's some good food, you know.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** You can.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** You can't pass a background check, right?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** Plus, you'll have the backing of... Do you have any references?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:47]** There is a 30-day waiting period before you can file any claims for any medical insurance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** But besides that... There's a probationary period, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Yeah, and you can only re-enroll once a year.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** All right, well, it's tough.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Don't miss your enrollment period, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** I can't keep it up.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** I can't keep it up.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:06]** It's too good.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Cool.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** So, okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:12]** Do you have Cobra coverage right now?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Because you're between jobs.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Like, that's why.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:17]** What's the True Warriors coverage standard?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** I don't actually know what coverage means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:28]** So, on a scale from, say, I don't know, 1 to 20, how strong do you think we should be before maybe facing this?

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Don't you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** Probably at least a level, I don't know, three, maybe four.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:38]** You guys look like you're level two-ish.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** So I feel like you guys leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** You're a good judge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** You leave the car yards and you start walking back through the city.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:52]** You guys are like, I sense that you guys aren't armed up and ready.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** With Michael or did he?

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** Your hands are close.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Michael's with you.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Okay.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Yeah.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** He's got nowhere to go.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** Like if he goes anywhere else in this town, they're going to find him.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Yeah.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** All right.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** So we're making our way over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Where are you guys headed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** We should probably roll stealth and sneak out through here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** Can we see a map of Kefaktipa?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** Can I just ask, where are you headed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Are we going back to... I think we head back to Riddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:25]** The only place I can think of is Shunker's Delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Okay, I just wanted you guys to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** I didn't... Okay, so we have options to go elsewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** I mean, go where the f*** you want.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** Tabletop RPGs, you do what you want.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Put you back on this map.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** It's a map of K'vok Depot.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** You're coming out from... I don't know where you guys are on this map because I didn't prep for this.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Hold on.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** The Kayas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** We're at 11.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** The Kayas.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** They misspelled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Oh, I can't even select you guys?

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Why is that?

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I don't know.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** I can select me.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Up here to 11.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** There we go.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** I didn't add Michael, but Michael's with you.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** So you guys are making your way straight back towards Junker's Delight?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** All right, before you even get close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** What is Thassilon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Thassilon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Number eight.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Thassilon, number eight.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Maybe we can ask the riddle about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:19]** Thassilon, as you walk past it, is a famous hair salon.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** That's salon.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Oh, that's a lot.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Yes.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Ooh.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Okay.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** That's good.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Is there a lot of people out?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** Kind of like the Paul Mitchell school of hairstyle.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** It is, it is actually late in the evening at this point.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** It is past, you know, the sun is still up, but it is waning.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Um, it's still hot.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Like I said, 120 degrees.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** Um, you guys are walking along and, and you're not even halfway to junkers delight.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** And you hear a hiss, uh,

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** From one of the alleyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Oh, no.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** A hiss?

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Can we roll perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** You don't even need to roll perception.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** No, it's Riddle.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** And she waves at you from this random alleyway.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:16]** And she waves you down and she kind of drags you down a couple of side streets and then finally back through the agency's back door.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** So you're now inside...

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:40]** of junkers delight and she's she's very clearly pleased that uh very 13 is still alive and she tells you that like joe trulu's gang has been watching you and her and and she prefers not to be beaten up again and then like once inside she she you know she looks both ways and she slams the door shut and locks it with four different locks um

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** Riddle looks at Michael with a little bit of confusion.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** He's cool.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** And she scans the rest of you.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** And when she gets to Vary, Vary's face kind of drops.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:00]** And she apologizes, or they apologize to Riddle and say, like, I'm sorry.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** He died fighting for my life.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** He died a hero.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** And Riddle realizes that Lorgan is gone.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Oh, Lorgan.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:15]** She says, he was the best, loyal and strong, and I...

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** I got to send a message to his sister.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:24]** Like, can you just tell these guys about your treasure?

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** And she's clearly just over it.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:36]** Like, she's happy that Vahri's alive, you know, but she's lost her last and most loyal guide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Michael, are you looking for a new job?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** If you don't want to join our crew, maybe Riddle could take you in.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** If you don't feel up to joining our...

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** Cadre in the stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** There's an opening for a guide around car yards.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** You might fit the bill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** Yeah, I don't know, man.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** Like I said, I'm kind of dead meat if I stick around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** I hear you.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** You're welcome to come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** If I can get some rest up, I could be useful.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** All right, that's good.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** I think that would be great.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** You are at a crossroads.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** We'll all rest up, yes.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** Yeah, I will definitely rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** Before we rest, Vary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** This is Rolu, by the way.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** He's a major a**hole.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** Just heads up.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Say again?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** No, he's just informing.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** He's just giving, like, Michael the scope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** I would not listen to anything Thaddeus says.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** Cold, calculating, and misleading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:45]** So you guys kind of get comfortable in Junkers Delight.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** Like I said, there's three desks there that are pretty dusty.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:52]** Each have a computer and there's a chair on one side and a couple chairs on the other.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:57]** There's a couch over in the quote-unquote lounge, which is only a few feet away.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:27]** Riddle is sitting at one desk and Vahri goes over and sits at another desk and she's they say like of course yes first of all let me let me thank you once again for rescuing me I I knew I chose correctly when I picked Riddle's agency to help me in my task and Riddle hears this and she starts to interrupt but Vahri waves her hand over or waves their hand over and

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** No, no, don't be modest.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:33]** Your employees are to be commended and you for your management.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** Riddle shrugs apologetically and lets it roll.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** Vary says, I am very sorry for your loss.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Lorgan was a great man.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** And then they both fall silent for a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** He can rest easy.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** We have the watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:01]** And as you say that, Riddle nods and she picks up the phone and starts dialing.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:07]** And then Vari looks at all of you, including Michael.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:16]** I shared some of this with Riddle, but I think you should all know how I came to Akitan.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:25]** As you may know, sometimes when we androids die, our mortal shell becomes home to a new soul.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:33]** This is especially true if an android chooses to relinquish their life, but it also occurs if a body is relatively intact upon death.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:38]** This was the case for one of my progenitors, VARI-8.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:47]** They were an engineer aboard a scientific research vessel called the Stellar Flare in the years shortly after the GAP.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:55]** The crew engaged in experiments to develop a new source of power drawn from the then-recently-discovered drift.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:05]** They believed that the technology similar to that of the drift engines could provide energy without the need for batteries.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:16]** Unfortunately, VARI-8's research ended abruptly when an accident caused them to crash here on Akiton.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:21]** And Vary13 smiles as if they've just solved an ages-old mystery.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Don't you see?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:31]** If we can salvage some of the technology from the Stellar Flare, we might be able to restart that research.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** It could change the galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** And that's our game.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Oh!

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** That is pretty interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:49]** I was just going to cast or use Sense Motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Yep.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:00]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
