**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:55 - 00:01:05]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** The musical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:09]** Yes, this is the holiday special.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:13]** Winner of three Tony Awards.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** Narrated by Kevin E. Decker.

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** So excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** It is the holidays.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** It's snowing outside, I assume, in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** Hanukkah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Hanukkah starts this week.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** Christmas is coming up fast.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:30]** There's also Kwanzaa and whatever comes from Seinfeld.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** What was that one?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Festivus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Festivus for the rest of us.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** And if we missed any holidays, please let us know.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:43]** I think we talked about this a couple years ago about what holidays exist in the Starfinder universe, and there weren't many.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** So we can create them if you want.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Skittermanders have their own holiday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** Now I'm just... What were you going to say, John?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Nothing.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I spoke too early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** Nothing in the books, but there are some in player lore.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** But along those lines, I am very curious...

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:13]** since it's before both of the major holidays, I kind of want to know what is on your wish list, your Christmas list or your Hanukkah list or whatever list is yours.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** I want to know what is the number one thing on your Christmas list.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:25]** My number one want, and I've told my wife about this, I even sent her the information, I want a BD1 Lego set.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** Aww.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:42]** it is the the drone from uh fallen order yeah and you made an appearance in well abd something made an appearance in mandalorian so it's canon now uh but yes that's that's my want so i am always


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:42 - 00:03:03]** just so impressed with the people who are like dude legos are my jam and then they'll show you like just the most expensive outrageous incredible lego sets and now live on air kev has said that he will be one of those people it is confirmed no i want i want one set that's how it starts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:30]** yeah you should just make a whole room for legos man i have a friend i just went down to virginia to see some friends and everywhere in his house he has all these super expensive lego sets hogwarts and you know star wars uh and the guardians of the galaxy ship that the katushis is based off of he actually had a mario tv where you can crank it and mario actually jumps on the screen yeah there's all sorts of cool legos i kind of want that one that one's cool yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Kev, what I think you do is this.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** You start with one, then you get another, then another.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** Pretty soon you have a whole collection that you need to put a room.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:44]** Then you're worried about how much money is in that room, so you hire a couple guards to protect it.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:52]** Then you just buy a whole new house to set up as your personal museum, and then you just become a villain.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:57]** Then other people will create an adventuring party, come and steal your Legos as treasure.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** And that's it.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** It's going to be us.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:04]** We're going to go against Kevin in real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:10]** Knowing Kev, he designed all these Legos to work animatronically.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Oh, they'll attack us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** They're Lego traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** Plus he has connections to space lasers probably and stuff with what he does.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** So he can try to get us that way too.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** We'll get you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Anyways, moving on.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Kelly, what do you want for the holidays?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** It's kind of boring.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:35]** I guess Vinny might get into it, but in my Z, I want to put in a touchscreen and shit.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** I want to upgrade it a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** Underrated.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Underrated choice.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:45]** I fully support that choice.

**[00:04:45 - 00:05:08]** it's possible that's what i'm gonna do you can do yeah what i really want i want to voice my support for this i've always had like older cars and um in the last three cars i've moved the same head unit from one to the next to the next and like bluetooth touchscreen dvd player like the whole i don't care how old the car is if i could plug my phone in and play music

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Cruise control, no cruise control.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:14]** As long as the AC works because we're in Florida and I can play tunes.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** That's what matters.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Fully support it.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:23]** I had a 67-month saying that somebody had updated the radio already, but it was just like an AM FM radio.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Because in 1967, it was only an AM radio with a single speaker.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** So they added two more speakers.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Wow.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** But I wanted it to play MP3 players.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** So I actually replaced that radio with an MP3 player radio.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** So I had my own tunes on my own.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Yeah.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:57]** anyways oh nice so good luck with that do you want do you want uh your fictional character to bring you a uh just the unit or do you want them to install it for you is the question my fictional character wait you mean like here's or thaddeus or what do you mean santa claus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Oh, whoever.

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Fictional.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Wait a second.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Hold on.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Are you trying to say Santa Claus isn't real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Is that what you're trying to say right now?

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** Kevin, what are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** It's not a fictional character in Hanukkah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** It's just candles.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** Yeah, dude, the candles bring the presents.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Who brings the presents?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** I think in Hanukkah, it's just you give presents to each other.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** I think there's no fiction involved in that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I've been to some Hanukkah celebrations.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** They were really dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** No, I mean, you have gifts on every day.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That's the whole point.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** You get a gift every day.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:36]** So, John, speaking of gifts on Hanukkah, is it the biggest gift the first day or the last day of Hanukkah?

**[00:06:36 - 00:07:03]** usually you do the gifts every day if there are like kids kids are like it's in the middle wait what oh in like a gaussian yeah there's a gaussian distribution of gifts on hanukkah the first first day is socks and the last day is a video game or is it video game then socks typically right now it's just the first video game socks it's just the first night yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** There's not a normal distribution of quality of gifts.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** It's just the first night that you all share gifts.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:14]** And then usually the young ones will get gifts throughout the rest of the eight days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Well, you're young enough.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** What gift do you want?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** You know, I was thinking hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:24]** I was like, man, Papa Kev asked me what do I want.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** And I'm not going to lie.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** I'm pretty content.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:32]** I couldn't come up with one single thing that I'm like, oh, I need this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:55]** like for sure it's like there are a bunch of things that i would like to have but i'm i'm good i'm happy with whatever comes my way okay this is that i i hate you i'm really sorry that i can't shop for you like it's impossible i'm sorry and then you're like well i already have everything i need so then you get the morality points plus that it's just like really really hard you want you want attention no

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Yeah, John.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** John, you're very great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:05]** For the record, there's nothing wrong with attention being on your Christmas list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** You know what?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** I think it's a fair ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** Everyone needs attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Well, it's been nice.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** John just left.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** He's leaving.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** He turned off his camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** You've been pretty quiet during this conversation.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** What's on your list?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Sorry, what?

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** What's on your holiday list?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:26]** Uh, my holiday list or my, yeah.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Okay.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:27]** My God.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:32]** Um, I mean, I'm, I'm hoping to get more organized this year.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Sure.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** But, uh, I think what I really, really like.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** That's probably what I'll end up getting.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** That or maybe tools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:46]** So you're hoping to get somebody to organize your stuff for you?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Or get organizing equipment?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** Like storage boxes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:54]** Storage... Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Like I do closet set up.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:03]** I'm like cool equipment, but also maybe help from, I don't know.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:11]** Maybe I'll meet somebody who, uh, organizes for, for professional living situations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:17]** That's another suggestion to us in dose discord, please get a visit from Marie condo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Yeah, you need your own.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:46]** precisely uh i mostly need bookshelves which is really i really like shelves but this one these ones before i had the whatever it's probably like perfectly square ones are yes those ones i didn't think of something it's not your turn anymore john but what i am actually like the morality card to get for christmas can i say what i actually really want to get for christmas


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Yes, that's what the question was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:54]** Some new, we'll save Keith.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Like a backpack or something?

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** And I'll have to ask Santa for that.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** Or a duffel bag, I don't know.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** Ooh, a duffel bag would be good.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Swim trunks.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** Some nice, tasteful undergarments.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Some intimates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** Some intimates.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Keep it on, keep it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** you've been left behind too.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** So what is, what is on your holiday list?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:24]** So this is funny because like, I kind of agree with John as much crap as I just gave him.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** Like, I feel like we're all getting to that point where we're old enough.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** If it's reasonable, ask to just buy it for ourselves.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** That.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** And if we have it, you're not allowed to buy Legos for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** I, you apparently have more restraint than I do.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** I would buy myself a freaking Lego.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Yeah.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Kevin, is there something you need to tell us about?

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Okay.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Sorry.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** No, I'm a huge Ed Sheeran fan.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** There's not a song that he's put out that I don't absolutely love.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:57]** And he's coming to Tampa, which is about three hours away in May, which is right around both mine and John's birthday.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:02]** And so I want some tickets to that concert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:07]** Well, I'm going to start listening to Miami radio and trying to win those for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** Vinny, you know, I have to say that gives me shivers.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** That just sounds perfect.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:19]** And just thinking out loud, you know, if I just take the shape of you and I put it on a castle on the hill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** All right.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** So I think it's time to play Starfinder.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:27]** Just if you didn't catch that, those are all Ed Sheeran references.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** So good luck to all of you.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** I hope you get what you want.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** I think we have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Spectacular, John.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Yeah, that was very nice, John.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, we won't get sued for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** They're just names of songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** That's fine.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Yeah.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Just take me back to London.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** That's all I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** All right.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** So are you guys ready to play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Nice.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Nice with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** All right, let's play.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Let's play.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Change, change, change.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** John, change the music.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:52]** Update it.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** It's got to look.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Thank you, Sirens.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:01]** And since John didn't pay attention to what we did last week, I'll recap for him.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** So a lot of things happened last time.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:12]** You guys set out in search of Baumguzzle and the goblins to see if they could help you with Tinkerton, or maybe use them as murderbot fodder.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:20]** As you walked through a valley of junk, you noticed these shadows moving around on the hilltops.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:28]** And then you saw a couple of space goblins shouting from the tops of the junk piles, Press trigger!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** Press trigger!

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Press trigger!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:48]** down at you and the question is were all those shadows that you saw goblins or something else uh maybe we'll find out maybe we'll i thought you said there were a mix of shadows yeah yeah so we know the shadows are shadows like is there different types of shadows like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:54]** No, you were like, there's some big ass shadows and some little ones that shouted, so it's obviously different, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** I do not recall those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:03]** There's a principle where if the body's bigger, the shadow's bigger.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** That's not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** That is not true at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** It all depends on their distance from a light source.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** Given the same angle from the primary source of light,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** Right, and the angle of the light and all that stuff.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** I don't think the sun on Akiton is moving that fast.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** There's four suns for Akiton.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** I'd take that back.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** I actually don't know.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Yeah.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** All right, now I lost where I was in our...

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Okay, so shadowy goblins.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Everybody jump, Kevin, now.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** Hooray!

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:42]** And then you made it to this area that was a clearing with debris scattered everywhere violently.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** And in the distance of that, you actually saw some broken starship consoles.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Consoles?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Consoles.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Consoles.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** Consoles.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:59]** And behind a transparent aluminum screen, you saw the silhouette of something.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Not a shadow, but a silhouette.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:10]** As you start to sneak up on that silhouetted character, you were actually confronted from behind by the true warriors.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:16]** They realized that Vahri 13 isn't with you, and so one of them took off to go find Vahri.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** That's when the fight started with the other three that were left behind.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:29]** But then the murder bot bursts from the junk in the southeast corner of the map, throwing the junk at the two warriors.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:34]** But Chalk was a little distracted and was more interested in that shadowy figure.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** So he moved closer to find the battle-weathered Vesk, Zethelred.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:45]** And Chalk was able to tell that Zethelred was not alive.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** That was like a freebie.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:50]** I was going to make you roll a medicine check, but none of you guys have medicine, so.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** But let me take you back to the map.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** To the map.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** To the map.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** To the map.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** To the map.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** Oh, show me.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** To the map.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Oh, wow.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** There's the map.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Did that work?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** Okay.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:09]** And just a rundown for the listener, this map in the middle of the map is a diamond rhombus shape.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:16]** It's a square shape that's on an angle that is a platform of some sort that's about five feet high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** What is it elevated by, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** It's just thick, man.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** It's just like a five-foot chunk of metal.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** It's a thick boy.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** It's the side of a hole.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** It's the hole of a starship is laying flat on this ground.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:33]** So in order to walk next to that and get up on top of it, it is going to be difficult terrain.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:41]** And then on the far side, there is those consoles that we talked about with the aluminum screen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:46]** On the left side is Chak with those consoles where Zethelred is.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:52]** On the very top of the map, we have the three pirates, Terme, Rolu, and Thaddeus.

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:00]** To the right of the map, at the top, we have a lieutenant true warrior and a tough true warrior.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:07]** The third true warrior was like, f*** this, and left as soon as the murder bot came out.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:12]** And at the bottom right-hand corner of the map is the murder bot.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** He takes up four squares, and he is very large.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** And we are not near any of this, pretty much.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** For now.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:25]** Shaq is near the body, and we are all way up on the north, behind the rubble.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:29]** But just a reminder, you are in initiative order.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Yes.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** And where we left off was actually, Shaq, you used your move action.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Do you want to use anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:42]** I want to use another move action to climb up on this control platform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** I thought you were already up on top of that control platform.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Oh.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Yeah, weren't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** That was your move action.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:51]** Getting a closer look at... Sethelred?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Yeah.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Yeah, that was a free perception checks.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** So you want to get closer and examine Sethelred?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** Um, I do quick, quick clerical thing.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** I think there are two of me on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Yeah, I saw that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Whoa, there are.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Wow.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Ignore that.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Um, how did that happen?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Multiplicity.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Which one, which one do you have control of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** I have control of both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** No, that's not okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** I control them both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Oh, let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** So this one is dead.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** I control all of the check.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** The swarm.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:25]** Okay, so that makes sense why you were asking whether or not you would move to the console.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:35]** So you actually moved up onto the console at the end of the last turn, and you still have a standard action or another move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** So I'm up on this console.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** Do I have a fairly clear view of the scene?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** At this point, yes.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** You can see everything.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** Jack's eyes open super wide at the sight of the murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Oh, okay.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Yeah, you're tall enough to see the murder bot at this point.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Or you're high enough to see the murder bot, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:07]** You see, like, his vines drop open as if a mouth leaves hit the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** Holy skittermander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:20]** He moves down into where the Vesk was and is trying to ascertain, like, what the Vesk was controlling when she died.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Which might have to wait until next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** No, I'll give that to you.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:34]** So as you climb, Zethelred is dead and lumped over the console, but it's not very clear whether or not he was actually doing something.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** Or if he was just taking a break.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Gotcha.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:45]** And so, but what you do find is I'll give you, I'll steal your turn to explain what you see on him.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:51]** Besides him lies an ember flame dash go and a hollow grenade.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** It's a Mark one hybrid item.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** He is wearing a vest breeding armor one.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** And on his left hand, you see a glove with a mass of metal wires and small crystals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** That s***.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** I'm just going to metagame.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Get that s***.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** You need it.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:14]** And what looks like a spell gem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** That's what you need for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Do you have mysticism?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:38]** scrolling scrolling scrolling i do not have mysticism dang okay well never mind um i think we're gonna have to wait till your next turn to explore any of this stuff further um so let's move on and just remember that there's a lot more to come back to all right it is now the tough true warriors turn

**[00:19:38 - 00:20:01]** let's zoom scan over to the other side pan over uh action tough true warrior he he's like looking back and forth he's a little confused like do i do i attack the the pirates or do i fight this thing but like he's gonna fight something the answer is obvious he's gonna fight himself he's gonna go after um after the man i'm just gonna roll for it hold on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Rolling the dice.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** It's a four.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** That means himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** On a d6, I was going to make him go after you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** That's unfair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** So he's going to move one, two, three, four...

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Bam!

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Right there.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:27]** He is going to walk past the true warrior lieutenant and take a diagonal step towards you three.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** He's now directly below and adjacent to Thaddeus.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** And he is going to roll to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** Punch him right in his cat face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** That's an 18 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** No miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** I'm so sorry, but that doesn't hit Kevin.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** That doesn't hit?

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** No, it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Oh, man.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** It's because you're wearing that new armor, huh?

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Yeah.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** Oh, wow.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** I can't just expect to hit all the time.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Your armor better not be a 42 at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** That's 41, right?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Yeah.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** It's fine.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** Everything's kosher, man.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** Okay.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** We're good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** I'm going to have to go look at this.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:12]** Moving on, it is top of the round two, and it is the lieutenant's turn.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Who are they going to attack?

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:19]** And she is just as confused as the rest of you about what this thing is.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** I'm going to roll a d6 again.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** High numbers are attacking you, and low numbers are attacking me.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Oh, a one on the dice.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:32]** So she's bobbling back and forth and doesn't know what to do.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Flip-flopping, flip-flopping.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:39]** She's going to take a shot at the junk monster.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** I want the junk monster.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Wise.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** All right.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Hit.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** That's a 19 on the die.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** That's definitely a hit.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:55]** And that's 1d6 damage plus two for five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:55 - 00:22:23]** the monster's dead she shoots the monster and now it is thaddeus's turn okay so thaddeus is gonna he just takes out his claw and like raises it up to the sky and it just glints in the one akatonian sun by the way there's only one uh and then look that up yeah eddie or someone did he's gonna take it and just slash directly vertically down does he hit with a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** He does, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** Well, you're going to receive one damage.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** So he's going to give him a nice little scratch right above the eyebrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:42]** He's got a nice bald strip down his chit beard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** And that's the end of your turn?

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Amazing.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Are you going to move now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** I don't think I can move.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** That's the problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:56]** You could step through a friendly character's... Can I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Fair warning, though.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** You will be leaving... Okay, say again?

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** I'll be leaving what?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** A threatened square.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** What were you going to say?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** You can't take a guarded step.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Because I'd attack.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Because you'd...

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** Well, no, because you can't guard and step into somebody else's square.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** But you can move through.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** You can pass through their square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:15]** Is this square uninhabitable to the north of us?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** There's like some thing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** I'm going to say yes to that.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** Okay, how about this, Kevin, though?

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** I'm a very, very acrobatic cat, and I'm not kidding.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** So can I like jump on top of that?

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:25]** On top of what?

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** On top of this rubbish here.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** I'm like a very, very acrobatic kitty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:34]** You probably could jump up there, but it would provoke an attack of opportunity.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Yes, it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Are we talking about where the X is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** I can't do a guarded jump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Yeah, you're right.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:42]** That was something I was going to ask separately, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:49]** Okay, so one thing is you can't do a garden step into or out of, I believe, difficult terrain.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:54]** And that border with the green line is difficult terrain.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Got it.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** So you can move up there.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** It'll take two steps to go up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** And it'll provoke attack of opportunity, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:30]** you would provide well I'm not going to move then and what Thaddeus is going to do he's just going to like try to get read something about this big mega junk bot guy so he's just going to roll to find out more about him what can he do what's that roll you can do life science mysticism or engineering okay just one moment please it'll have to be this let's hope I roll high it's just a 10 does he find anything out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** 10 on what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Life signs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** Oh, you find out that he is a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** So is he related to Rick19?

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** Would I know that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** So he's related to Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Rick18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Is this a previous generation of Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** There's no relation that you can tell from this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Maybe Rick gets inspiration from him.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:57]** Well, apparently Thaddeus is just going to have to try to soak up this damage a little tankily and then just let that go on.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:06]** Okay, just a reminder before we forget is acrobatics does allow you, I believe it's acrobatics, to do a tumble.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:15]** So read up on those rules if you're looking to get through an opponent's threatened square without attacking.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Yep.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** So that is a possibility.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** But you didn't do this down because we didn't remember.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** And it is now...

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** All right.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:38]** Rolu, seeing this gargantuan creature stumble out of this mass of junk, is going to step up onto this center dais.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:48]** As you see his body and the robes kind of like scrape up along the side of this hole and all the wiring and conduits that are coming out.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:57]** And then he's going to stay in kind of a crouched position and look at this junk monster and just take a deep breath.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** It's the end of your turn.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Really?

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:14]** He's going to look through his scope and there's just a big breath that comes out as he focuses his eyes onto the monster.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:21]** And before he fires, he's going to use a mysticism check to see what he can find out about this creature.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Is Mysticism still Coolio?

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** It is Coolio.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** Oh, how Coolio is a 16.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** So cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** I think that meets the value.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** That meets the DC.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Ty goes to the Inquisitor.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Hold on, I lost it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** I don't know where I put it.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:43]** Ty, you'll get one detail for that.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** Hey, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** Nice use of both Inquisitor and Deus.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Oh, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** I don't know what any of these words mean.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:54]** As he's stepping up onto this dais, he says, watch out for these violent debris all about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** So you want anything specific, or you just want to take whatever information I tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** That's a really good question.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** Are there... Just tell me anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** He really appreciates salad bars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Hey, me too.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** Do you know what DR means?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Yes.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** It has a DR5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Wow.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Wow.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Wow.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Wow.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Adamantine.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Oh, that's what he's made of?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Is that what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Adamantine?

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** No.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** So DR means that it's damage reduction.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Okay.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:30]** And so anything besides adamantine is reduced by five.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:38]** And knowing this, you now realize that when the true warrior lieutenant took a shot, it did absolutely nothing to the junk warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Good sh**.

**[00:27:40 - 00:28:06]** all right this is gonna be some tough like we are in for a fight yeah with that said rollo's gonna send off another opening salvo from us that is only anything but adamantine yes yes it's reduction of damage okay okay yeah 14 to hit will just randomly has adamantine i wouldn't be surprised 14 yeah yeah it was does not hit nice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:14]** adamantine shot if you recall fantastic what happens when it doesn't hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You miss.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Okay.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** I was hoping for some cool Kev thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Sorry, I'm busy searching stuff and trying to check things.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** That's fine.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:33]** No, the bullet skims past and flickers his eyelashes that are made out of wires and cables.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Like a butterfly in the wind.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Your eyelashes look good.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** I shout.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** It is now that creature's turn.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** It's angry.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** It's upset.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:48]** It's going to take one step and two steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:56]** It is currently walking five feet ahead and then five feet diagonally left, just like across this yard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:03]** And it is now in reach, and it's going to swing at and do a slam against the true warrior.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** The lieutenant.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** Lieutenant.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** Ooh, that hits.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Yes.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** And that is a D8.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Die, Lieutenant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** This one, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Yeah, the one that is not in front of Treme, that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** Ooh, that's 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** And the Lieutenant is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** What?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** What?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** A Lieutenant of the True Warriors is dead.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** One shot right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:39]** Yeah, so that first, when the Junk Warrior threw that panel, that did a lot of damage to her.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** That's right.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Thaddeus attacked her.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** Treme blew fire at her.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:47]** And then this monster comes up and just smashes a hand on top of her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** And she is dead and out of the combat.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** My goodness.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** And it is now Torme's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:06]** So Torme is going to take a guarded step away from the tough true warriors sneakily.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:11]** Just a little slide to the right.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Yes.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Okay.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** And then who's next in initiative order?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** I would know this, right?

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** I'm not sure you would, but sure, I'll tell you.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Chalk.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Chalk is immediately after you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Chalk?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** Does chalk have a... I don't see chalk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** You do not see chalk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Okay, so I'm going to run over.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:35]** I'm going to use... I'm going to double move and run as far as... I can do this unencumbered, right?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Are you encumbered?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:42]** No, but I mean, the terrain is, I'm in, I have clear shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:48]** So if you're going over junk, that junk that I'm clicking on the top left of the map, that is going to be difficult terrain.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:53]** And if you're on the edge of this here, where you're at, I would say you're okay.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** If you run straight, you're not going to have to use difficult terrain.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** But once you hit that other junk, it will be difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** So you can get up to and on top of the console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** And I can't see Murderbot.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:32]** you can because the the the platform in the middle is only i think i said two and a half feet okay well i think i said five feet earlier but last time i said two and a half feet it's it's difficult terrain to get on enough but otherwise it's not impeding anybody's is there anything more that i can learn from a mysticism check can i do that as a free uh identify creature uh yeah i'll give that to you oh

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** 19 on the die, plus my bonus, which is four, so for 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** Dang, there you go.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** 23, that's two pieces of information, if I'm doing math in my head right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:43 - 00:32:01]** So I imagine Terme, after reaching the platform and seeing this sort of difficult terrain, sort of climbs almost up, just leaning against this sort of platform and looks over at the junk monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** I'll give you one special ability.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** It has an item or a skill called Junk Repair.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** And I'll kind of leave that open-ended for you.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:17]** And then it also has an issue with going berserk at lower HP.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Yikes.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** And we'll learn more about that when that happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** Kev, did you get Vinny's message, by the way?

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** I'm just going to call it out.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:30]** Okay, so when you have DR, energy weapons or energy damage bypasses DR. That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Thank you.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Thank you for reminding me.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:36]** So energy weapons do bypass DR. Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:43]** Still a big fight that we're going to have to deal with, but I'm going to breathe a little bit of fresh air here.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** That's the end of Treme's turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** Yes, that's my turn.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Oh, man, that drunk...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:49 - 00:33:14]** chunk monster thing holy cow oh yeah it can repair itself i think termay is is lost for words all right and we're back to chalk what do you want to do um first thing chalk is going to do is you're going to look at that aluminum screen to see if it's active like is there any indication that these panels are on and and doing anything


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:19]** I would say the screen is more like just a shield of some sort.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** It was probably the quote unquote windshield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Got it.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** The drift shield.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** It's not like a TV screen.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** It's like a protective screen.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** It's just a protective.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Got it.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:35]** And the consoles have been in disrepair for 300 years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:36 - 00:34:01]** so no there's nothing active on these things got it i'll give you that for free so you still have a standard action to move action what are you gonna do um yeah cool i i miscalculated i came over here thinking like that was a big aluminum tv screen and like the vest was controlling something oh man this is going to be the key sorry if i misled you on that one cool so i like it i was i was like where your head was at


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** If you roll three engineering checks in a row, I'll give it to you.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** I want to turn it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** No, I'm kidding.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** If you make that computers, I'll take those odds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** What I do want to do is if you I'll give you.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Yes, I'm going to give you a culture check.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Yeah.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** So roll me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Dope.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** What does it mean?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Wow.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** That's 2025.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** All right.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** You passed.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:31]** This was like a chain of doors type thing for me.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** I wrote it badly.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** I'm sorry.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:40]** You know, after looking at some of the stuff that Zethelred had on him, you know that the

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** The Vesk Brigadine armor is a lightweight breastplate made of interlocking polymer hexagons.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:53]** It flexes almost like fabric under normal use, but it becomes rigid as steel in response to any kind of impact.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:59]** That armor is preferred by Vesks who prize mobility over maximum protection.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** So you guys can either try to figure this out yourself or give me a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** I'll take a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Roll it.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** 23.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Nice.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** All right.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:15]** So you know that Zethelred left his heavy armor behind because Thaddeus is currently wearing it.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** And he chose to wear this lighter armor.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** And he also has these hollow grenades.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:28]** So if you put two and two together, his primary tactics were mobility and distraction for whatever he was hunting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Gotcha.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Gotcha.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Cool.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** One, kudos for how you played that.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** Two, Jack is going to do his favorite thing.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** He's going to grab some random explosives and start hucking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:50]** So Jack grabs, you said there were two hollow grenades?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** Seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** At least 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** I said a hollow grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:56]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** I said one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** Sorry.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** Jack grabs the hollow grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** The hollow grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** The hollow grenade.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:09]** And I don't know if you guys have seen Guardians 2, but the way Groot runs away with the bomb above his head.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:36]** he's holding the hollow grenade above his head and running past termadin toward the uh oh um chalk toward the sorry i've got to hit the right button to move him in his square and i want to do some measuring no snapping please because i want to move to basically here uh which is on top of the dais


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** I don't even know what dais means.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** It's an elevated platform.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Okay, it's a dais.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Yep.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** All right.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** Cool.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:46]** So that was your move action, and then from there, you're going to do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Let's see.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Can I huck a grenade that far?

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** I think I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:57]** So you can throw a grenade, whatever it says, and then you take a minus five for anything past that, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Right.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** I got to look up hollow grenade, though.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I thought it was 20 feet, usually.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** Do we want to just go 20 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** I think it's probably less than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** Are you proficient in grenades?

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Good point.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** I hope he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Oh, it says 20 feet.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Dope.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Okay.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** 20 feet.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** 20 feet.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** I'm going to chuck the grenade 17 and a half feet.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** I don't really know.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** I'm terrible with grenades.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** I'm pretty sure it's a DC.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** You have to hit an AC-5.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:49]** in order to hit the square that you're in right okay pretty sure what that is sounds right and then if you miss then we'll do a whole 1d8 random chance of where it goes otherwise cool dc5 is it a dexterity check is it acrobatics is it good question i think it's just your like just your strength explode dc was 12.

**[00:37:49 - 00:38:19]** I think that's the DC to to what am I trying to say to avoid the explosion right depends on that grenade yeah this is a strange yeah why is it so hard this is a strange place your grenades suck no they're actually really good you just if you know the rules we just haven't had to use one in a while I thought the last time we used one was with that bridge I just bought a bunch of them yeah just bought a bunch of them

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:24]** Also, don't just type in throwing the grenade in Google.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Make sure you add in Starfinder.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:29]** Don't want to end up on any watch list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Now John's on a list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** Yeah, so it's AC5, D20.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:40]** What I'm seeing here for Starfinder, it's a D20 plus your base attack bonus plus your strength modifier.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** And then you apply anything else like a penalty for range, which we're good.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** And then if you hit, then you deal damage to the creatures within the radius.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:57]** And the creature also makes a saving throw to have the damage and negate the additional effect.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** So you roll D20 base attack bonus plus your strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Cool.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** D20 minus one.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** There it is.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** So this is going to make a holographic image.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** It's a level.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** It's a Mark one hollow grenade, right?

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I'm going to throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** We're going to find out what it does together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** So what's your role?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:41]** thankfully it's a dc5 so you throw the grenade yep it bounces and rolls and it then creates a pre-programmed illusion no larger than the blast radius which is the illusion functions as if it if you if you had cast holographic image with that level duration according to the grenades type it's amazing dope what do we see

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:45]** So it is a caster level three, right?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** And a duration of two.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Mark three?

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** No, I'm looking at mark one.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** Mark three is a caster level nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** So what do we see?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** What do our characters see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Does the caster level?

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** No, the vest would have programmed it.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** You're right.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** The vest.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** So when you throw it, I just got to Google random creature.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:18]** It grows into this bluish looking... Dude, do we see Hrog challenging the murder bot?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Yes, you see a Rivener.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** It's not a Rivener yet, though.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** It's not Little Harag.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** It is a Rivener.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** So it's actually a large Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** Just copy and pasted this junk robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** There's two junk robots.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** There's another junk robot.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** No, that's not a junk robot.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** That's the hologram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Oh, yeah, totally.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** It's the best.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** It's a giant hologram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** Dude, I am failing my will save to disbelieve this hologram.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** So it looks like another junk robot.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** Nope.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:58]** In game, you see a very large Rivener, a Keshti Rivener.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** That's awesome.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Turn well spent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** It's like that for one round, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** It's for two rounds.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** I'm going to say two rounds after he throws it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** So at the end of the following turn.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Not my next turn, but the turn after.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Two more turns, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Yep.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** Two more turns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Right, so not this turn.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** Turn after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** All right.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** The lieutenant is dead.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Let me mark her out.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** No.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** Fodder.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** No.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** But it is the tough true warrior's turn.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:39]** And the tough true warrior had just swung at Thaddeus in his heavy armor and missed and was like, hmm.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:46]** And then it turns around and it sees the Rivener and it sees the giant robot and it's like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** And the dead comrade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:54]** And he's just like, uh... And he just charges at the junk robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Well, you gotta give him this.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** He's pretty brave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** I mean... You know what?

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** He's dumb.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** He's dumb.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** That was respectful.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** It will be pot-valiant.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Yeah.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Pot-valiant, that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:31]** the tough warriors aren't the brightest uh they're definitely not the brightest maybe it's good we didn't bring michael with us he might have and as he as he moves in he actually passes through a threatened square to get there oh so he's gonna take an attack so dumb wait doesn't he also take an attack of opportunity from me he just ran away from like a threatened square with me too you're right he does thank you for saying that do you have a melee weapon out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** I mean, I just have my claws.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** I could just do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** You did use your claws, so yes, you can attack with your claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** I can't shoot him, right?

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** No, you can't do attack of opportunity with a ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Unarmed strike.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Thaddeus is like, oh, no, you don't.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** And he just eats.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** You know how he took off the middle of his beard?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** Now he just takes off just one eyebrow completely with one damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** So you hit?

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** What was your hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** It was 19.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** I'm sure that hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Yeah, okay, that hits.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:04]** So as he's running away, you just kind of reach your finger out and catch his eyebrow.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** And he doesn't even flinch, and he starts running at this giant robot.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:13]** And then the giant robot swings at him, but he's moving just fast enough that the robot...

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** like over punches and hits the ground.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** And now this tough, true warriors in it.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:23]** And he is going to take a swing, taking a swing.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** That is, that is a hit.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Just barely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** You know what?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** I'm going to root for you.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Tough.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:29]** Yeah.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Let's root for him.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** And that's seven points of damage.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:37]** Only two points go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Oh, not all of it goes through.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Two out of seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** That word damage reduction is hefty.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Do you have adamantine weapons?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** What is it, like 66%?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** It's just five points of damage.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Oh, it's always a flat five.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** It's a flat five unless you're using energy weapons or adamantine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Good lord, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** Nice.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Or magic weapons.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** So that's the end of the tough true warrior's turn.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Yeah.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** Thaddeus is going to check out

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** if there's anything on the body that he could use.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** So he's going to go this way.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** Thaddeus is running across the top of the map and he's going here.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** He knows that chat was looking at that body.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:20]** So he's going to like look on the body because he can't like really shoot.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:24]** He knows that like probably his weapons aren't going to do too well.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** So he's going to go over here.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** He looks in the body and I think he can see everything.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Right, Kevin?

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** Or do I need to roll some kind of roll for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Can you make it?

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** You would see everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Yes, it's a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Yeah, you're sprinting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Yeah, he sprints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** So he takes... Yeah, so once you get over there, you can see what is on him.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** Just to note, if you're going to try to take his... I thought it was difficult terrain.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Yeah, the... He can get there with a double move, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:55]** The armor is on him, so you're going to have to take it off and then put it back on, plus take off your armor.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** So we're going to have to look into doffing and donning rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** It's going to take you a lot of rounds.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** I don't know if I want to take his armor.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** I don't think it's any better than what I have.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Okay, just pointing that out.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** If I remember correctly.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** So just to be clear, Termay and Thaddeus have run away.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** And Rolu and Shack are... It's called tactics.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Why does no one understand the tactics?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** I know.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** I'm joking.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** We don't all want to be like this true warrior.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** He's kind of dumb.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** All right.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:26]** So he's going to like take that glove though that like is, you know, he's going to take the glove.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:30]** So he takes it and he like his eyes kind of like glow.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Thaddeus has been around enough to know what this is.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** And he's just going to like slip it on his arm.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:38]** And then he's going to ask Treme to may actually slow down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Sorry.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Um, you use two move actions to get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** So I can't do anything.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** No, technically you can hold that for the next round.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** You're right.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Thanks for calling me out.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:52]** That is just like, looks very like neat, like lovingly at that.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Like, look, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** There's a flaming Dashko.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** The grenade's gone.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Is it Dashko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Oh, I missed that.

**[00:45:59 - 00:45:59]** Yeah.

**[00:45:59 - 00:45:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** There's an ember flame Dashko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Can you wield Adoshko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** I will find out.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** I think so.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I'm a big beastly soldier.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** I think you can.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Yeah.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** I think Kelly just heard the spell gem and he was like, well, we can work it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** It's now Rolu's turn.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Top of the round.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Okay.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** Well, Thaddeus is the top of the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** That's right.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Always.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** Yes.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:28]** I think Rolu says, nicely done, Chuck, but now I don't know where to shoot.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** Would I know that I can shoot through this hologram or is it going to this holographic image?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** Why do you guys ask the hardest questions on the planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** It's a pretty simple thing.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Just make a call.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Can I shoot through it or is it covered?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** I'm going to say it's a minus two because it's soft cover.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** Okay.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** Wouldn't it merely dispel the illusion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Man, I don't know.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:55]** I think Rolu's just going to avoid the whole situation and is standing on one end of the dais.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** What is the spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Holographic image.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** You don't even need to worry about it because Rolu's just going to run to the other side.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** So there's not even a situation where you need to figure it out.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Well, now I'm curious.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** So I'm going to Google it and not pay attention to you while I'm reading it.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** Sounds good.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:14]** So Rolo's going to do kind of a slide, like an Apex Legends slide a little bit, just for flavor, as he's moving down the dais.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:25]** And get to the other end of the dais, and then going to line up a shot on this junk robo and take another shot at...

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:32]** And Kev, I'm here to tell you, it's a really strong 14 from an energy weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Ooh, energy weapon.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Let me double check that.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** It misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Nice.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Just can't slide cancel quite right.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** That's my yet another ineffective turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** And it is now the Junk Golem's turn.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** And it sees this Rivener.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** And please, I'm still trying to look up holographic image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** So I did a little bit of digging, but I don't know how official it is.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** It's just, it's illusionary holograms.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:11]** So it's effective against cameras and robots and living creatures from an illusionary standpoint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:17]** So I'm going to say that the robot will then attack it thinking it's real and will just automatically miss, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Yeah.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** The image disappears when it is struck by an opponent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** You see that?

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** I don't see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** So I'm looking at the third caster level for holographic image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Yeah.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:30]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:37]** It disappears when it is struck by an opponent unless you cause the hologram to react appropriately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:40]** Would that be included in the grenade, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** The pre-programmed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** To act appropriately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** Okay, I'm going to set a DC for it then in my head.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:54]** And if the monster hits it, then if the monster hits the AC or better, it dispels it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** But then that's getting a living hologram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** Man, you guys are throwing a lot of rules at me and I can't keep it straight.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Yeah, we should take what I'm giving you.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Simplified.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** This is hard to do.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** All right, I'm going to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Just the Technomancer...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:14]** Ooh, it is a 27 to hit, so that definitely hits whatever DCI set it at.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:21]** So it takes both hands and smashes down on this holographic Rivner, and it just poof.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** He actually swings so hard that he hits the grenade that is projecting it.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** And the grenade shatters.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:31]** So the holographic image is just gone, just vanished.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Poof.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Deleted off the screen.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Wow.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Pfft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Well, that was short-lived.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Yeah.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Yeah.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** This is just not inspiring.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Yeah.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** And that's the end of that turn, I believe.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Yeah.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Or this creature's turn.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** The murder bot?

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** The murder bot's turn.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** It is now Tremay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:53 - 00:50:02]** All right, so Termay is going to get up on the platform and look at the vesk where Chalk was.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:06]** Can I do like a... Oh, Zethelred.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** Mysticism check on his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:34]** cestus glove whatever go ahead and roll mysticism uh 20 dirty dirty 20 so um you know that there is a spell gem in the glove right in the like the back of the palm um and that spell gem has actually been used it is a dead spell gem um and the spell that was in it was junk armor okay

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:40]** Um, and what else you would know about it is that this glove acts as an Algecarnum, um, from threefold.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Yeah.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** You can load spell gems.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Cool.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** Basically gives you the spell thrower ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Who has spell gems?

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Someone does, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:51]** I do actually have the spell gems.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Oh, then Tormacia should just go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** Perfect.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** But,

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:23]** what you do know is that this it doesn't look like well you don't know this but the US players would is this Algecarnum isn't an Algecarnum it is definitely more junk related so it's probably that Zethelred worked with the goblins in order to craft yeah that's cool I see can I then therefore pick it up more easily is that going to be another move well let's just take it as a move action to take it off his hand and put it on yours I'll let you do that in one action nice

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** So that is the end of your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** All right.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** So Torme pulls the glove off and then pulls it onto his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** I've got some gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** Double check what Svalbard says.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:40]** I think you're going to have to take an action to put in a new gem.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** You've got some gems?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Like some dope gems?

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** But Chuck, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:47]** A selection of delicious jams.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Tomei, you have jams?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Yeah, from earlier.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** We found those jams, remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Use them here.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Kefak jam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Kefak jam.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** That'd be a dope playlist.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Whose turn is it?

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Chuck!

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:26]** Chuck is going to take a quick measurement by his eye, see that he's a shade too far from the old murder bot, step up by five feet-ish, a little bit closer, whip out his light asphalt blaster from his vine bandolier, sight down the sights, and say, Today's not your day!

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:44]** and pull the trigger and what kind of weapon are you shooting with my light asphalt blaster it is a force weapon all right so that will penetrate dr i'm assuming penetrate dr is it energy if i hit though and that's an 11 you hit is it energy it targets eac so yes what what do you roll

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** It misses completely.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Dude, we are so screwed for the fight.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** It shoots right past it.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** Yeah, that's not good.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** Chuck, that was a single shot, or you're taking two shots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** That was a single shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** You moved.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Oh, you moved.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Okay.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:08]** It's now the tough shoe warrior's turn, and they are just going to swing at this thing twice.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:13]** That is a 16 plus 8 minus 4.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:16]** Right, it's minus 4 from double attacks.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** I can't do high math.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** That's a hit.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** And I'll swing again.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Dang.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** So he hits once, but not twice.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Yes.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** This Tufts Warrior is doing more damage than we are.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Right.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Yeah.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** I'm glad I added that in for you guys.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Yeah, thanks, Kevin.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:41]** So he swings twice but only hits once, and he does five points of damage, which is all absorbed by the monster.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:48]** Why don't you have an adamantine weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:53]** Because his junk is just loose enough that it kind of just squeezes whenever you push on it.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** He's a soft junk robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** He's free-balling his junk.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** Got it.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** All right.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** It is now the top of round number three.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Thaddeus, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** How do you spell Dashko, please?

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** There it is.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** How do you spell Dashko?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** E-O-S-H-K-O-3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** Here, I will drop it on the screen for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Thaddeus can pick this up.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** Oh, man.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** Ember Flame Dashko.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:29]** And he's going to do that because he's... No, he just looks at Torme pick up the glove and he's like... But then he sees the Dashko out of the corner of his eye and he's like... And he picks it up.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** It's in his hand now.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** And there you go.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** And then he's going to... So that's one move action to pick that up.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Is that right, Kevin?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Uh, yes.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** Remove action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:43]** He's going to equip it, which I don't do enough to know if that's going to take a move action.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** So he equips the dash.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** No, that, that is the move action.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Got it.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** So then he's going to start moving back into the fight.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** All you people calling him cowards, but he's going to jump off.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** He's going to move here 20.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** And I think that's all he can move because he has like heavy armor.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** So there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:04]** Hey Thaddeus, before you leave, uh,

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:08]** Do you have anything that's ranged attack?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** I could maybe do the adamantine thing again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** I don't have any adamantine weapons.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Is that what you're asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** No, but I have a spell that makes your ammunition adamantine.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Oh, you don't say.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** Well, I'm right here, more or less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** You used it to shoot the Akeshi in the back, didn't you?

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** Yeah.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** I'd be very happy to do that.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** I just can't see Treme on the map, unfortunately.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Where'd you go, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** I'm on top of the platform where you just were.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Oh, you were covered up by the dead best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** I was chugging you as we were passing by.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** All right.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Well, what's up, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** So...

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Next round, I'll cast that idea.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** All right.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** Thanks.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** I'm going to try to flank this guy.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** I know that that Troy has taken him for the front, so I'm going to try to get him for the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Hit him with your ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** What is it?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** That asphalt blaster.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** What do you got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** I got a couple of things.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** I'll have that ready for you.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Which one is it?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** It's the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** Show me which one you're going to use.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** I think I have to pick the weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** All right.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Well, whatever one I have equipped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** You're going to pick whatever ranged weapon he has out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Yeah.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** It will be the tactical for me in Venomcaster.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** So it'd be good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** Nice.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** All right.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:37]** So Thaddeus, you picked up the dash coat and then moved forward and then had this long, lengthy conversation with Treme about what to do next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Free action.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Free action.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** It's like,

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** 30 seconds, like eight, five rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** Yeah.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** You guys play a whole game of Monopoly.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** I have Park Place.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Rolu, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:58]** I think Rolu is frustrated by the fact that he's missed twice.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:04]** And no, no, I don't think he has any awareness of what's going on behind him with Thaddeus and Torme.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:08]** And so Rolu just takes another deep sigh and focuses.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:15]** And I feel like in the six seconds, Rolu is just watching, trying to gauge the shot.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:20]** And he's going to take two shots, but he's just trying to slowly find the right time.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:24]** And it's almost like the end of the six seconds when he finally takes a shot.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** First shot is an eight.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Second shot is a 12.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:34]** And they both miss because I'm playing like garbage today.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Good Lord, man.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** What's going on?

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** Dude, four missed shots in a row.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** Yeah, we've been there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** Tink, tink.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** And it is now Choc's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:56]** Chuck is going to make an attack on... I'm speaking very slowly so that I can read my handbook.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** Stalling so I can read.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Selected ally.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Okay.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** That's annoying, but sure.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Chuck aims down his sights again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** I'm going to get you, you skitter man, are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:37]** and one big mean robotic skid terrible um he was trying to use harrying fire however the roll was like eight so which definitely misses ac-15 yeah it's ac-15 what is going on with us yep he says cool that didn't work hey uh don't hit me in the face

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Using not in the face.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Just in case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Classic.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Wait, you did do not in the face?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** I did do not in the face.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Okay.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Interesting.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** So that's the end of Chuck's turn, right?

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Alright, it's back to the tough true warrior.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** Let's see if he can do anything this time.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:57]** That is a... Man, I hate math.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** That's a miss.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:01]** And a miss.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** So he's just swinging away.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:07]** He's hitting the side of this monster and it's just absorbing everything he's given it.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:13]** Moving through these rounds pretty quick.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** It is round four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Yeah.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Thaddeus just like holds up his gun.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** He's like, here you go.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** He kind of like shakes it towards like Tomei.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** So you're going to delay.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** That's right.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** I can't do anything until that happens.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** So like he's going to wait.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Yeah, he's going to delay his turn.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** How about that?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Until after Tomei does that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** Okay, so you're going to delay until after Tomei does that.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** And that means I have to move you down in the order.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Not at the top anymore.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Yeah.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** No.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** As it should be.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** So I'm going to move you down.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:45]** And so after Tomei and Rolu, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** Again?

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** Rolu is very frustrated, and I think there's a... Just keep shooting.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:58]** There's a definite squint of his eyes, and if you could see his knuckles as they clench at the two missed shots.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Because...

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Also, I can't cast any magic.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** This thing is immune to magic.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** I can't cast any spells against it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** I thought it was the opposite.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I thought the magic was good against it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Yeah.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:17]** No, so the thing is that if you have magic that targets a junk or a robot creature, that might have some other effects or like a slow effect.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:21]** But if nothing does, then this is immune to magic.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Oh, that's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** Yeah, so acid spells will slow it.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:30]** And spells that use one bulk of the nerd electronics...

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** will cause it to be confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** Understood.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** But not the spells effect.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Just those effects.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:43]** Like, I interpreted that to mean if I cast a spell that uses one bulk of junk, it would have the spells effect plus confusion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:47]** That's a very... It's not written...

**[01:00:47 - 01:01:07]** exactly um i'm gonna give you the acid damage because it just says it says magic effects that deal acid damage slow so i'm i will give you the acid damage that's me being a gm call and i'm super soft super soft super soft super soft

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Shimmer.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** The conditioner in your hair.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** I'm soft and squishy just like this junk bot.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Junk bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Wait, question.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:22]** Wait, so I have mending, which is not the ideal spell to use because it heals constructs 1d4, but would it cause confusion?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** No.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** No, it's not acid.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** It doesn't do acid damage.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Oh, it's only acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** Oh, no, sorry.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:30]** The confusion comes from the electronic bulk one, so you have to do some kind of junk spell on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** Yeah.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Okay, junk spell.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:41]** All right, so then Rolu, I think, is just going to talk into his comms and just say, if anyone has any sort of junk spells, now is the time to use them as a reminder.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** And they're going to take off, take two more shots.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:45]** That's all I can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** All right, good luck.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** Who has junk spells, honestly?

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** Natural 20!

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** Hey-o!

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** What up?

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Finally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** Too bad this thing's immune to crits, huh?

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:58]** Oh, dude, why would you do that to me?

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:01]** So this is a natural 20 and you were shooting twice, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Yeah, I was shooting twice.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** That was my second shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:10]** So natural 20 hits automatically and you get to roll twice, use the add your bonuses, and we're doing the cards.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:10]** Is that correct?

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** I think we're doing the cards.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** Turn the tides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:20]** Finally, after much patience, Rolu does a whopping nine points of damage.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:43]** as uh shooting yeah total man all right yeah yeah yeah nine points of damage with energy so so it all goes through there's no minus to it and i i think with that shot rolu just has this sense of knowing that this is going to be the shot the sixth shot is finally going to be it and breathe into the future that he knows that he wants to make true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** Do we do critical cards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** I'm narrating as I'm getting the cards.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** I'm going to stop it.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** 3, 2, 1.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:55]** Stop shooting with an energy weapon.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Bonus effect.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]** the target is off, or, yeah, the target is off target for one round.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Nice.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Oh.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** Off target means off target star finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** If I had to guess, I'd say it's just a minus two.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Minus two to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:19]** Yeah, off target usually comes in, I think, when you're, like, floating in space and the rules around moving and trying to orient yourself.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** I feel like that's when I've seen it used before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** All right.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** So nine points.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:24]** I'm just curious.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:28]** So you rolled twice and you added all your bonuses and it still came out to just nine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:45]** yeah because my okay because one shot here is uh 2d4 worth of damage yeah all right all right really used to hit the way and and oh here's the thing there is a critical effect for this it's a 1d4 burn but

**[01:03:45 - 01:04:08]** because i use the cards i think this is a gm call is it that i get that effect or the i think i think the effect is the cards okay plus i don't think a burn effect would do anything i think it would because it's an energy effect it would it's 1d6 of fire damage until uh until they until they put it out all right uh that's pretty great you chose the cards

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Yeah, I digged it.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** I didn't realize I had burn, so I'm not going to.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** I took my hand off the chest piece.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:15]** Roll another crit, and then you can use burn.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:16]** Bam.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** That was only your first shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** No, that was my second shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Oh, your first shot missed?

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:21]** Yeah.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** So you missed the first time.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:29]** The second shot hits it square in the chest, and it just digs into it as the laser slowly eats away at his armor.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** And he's now down a little bit.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Just a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** And a minus two to attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:39]** And it is now the junk monster's turn.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** And he looks at you angrily.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:45]** You can see his big robotic head turn.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:52]** But then he shifts right back to this little hilky creature that is bashing on his belly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:58]** And Roloo under his breath goes, that's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:01]** Roloo tried to be a bat.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:05]** So that is a minus two, right?

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:06]** Yep.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** So hard math.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Hard math.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** That's a 19 to hit.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:11]** That hits.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** And that's going to be a D8 plus nine points of damage.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Dude, this guy's gone.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** And 11.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Oh, he's not, though.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** So he's pretty low.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:29]** The big junk monster just, like, brings a fist down on top of him.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** But you see him kind of, like, atlas it.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** Just, like, holds it up right at the end.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** He's real weak.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** Pushes it back up.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** Amazing.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** Oh, man.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** That tough true warrior is still alive.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** And that's the end of the Junk Monster's turn.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** It is now Termay's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** All right.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:57]** Termay, as promised, is going to walk over now with the Cestus in hand, I assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** With the what in hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:14]** the the sorry the uh the glove yeah it was what did you last turn you picked it up and put it on right yeah okay so yeah yeah you have it on you yes yeah so i'm gonna walk you have four hands so it

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:22]** so that I could see Thaddeus pull out his... lift up his caster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:31]** He kind of leans back and hands... No, he just has to lean it up, and I can just project my arms out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** Thaddeus grins and looks at him with his yellow eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:43]** And sort of like a bright sheen emanates from both my hands as well as the...

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:50]** The projectile inside of it, which as it receives adamantine shot.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** Nice.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:54]** Is this for my whole mag or just one shot?

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** No, just one shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** But you get three shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** You get to roll for each, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:06]** So as the bullet leaves, it has three different bullets, but you roll separately for each one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:09]** And it's 1d8 for each shot.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** And it's adamantine.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** So there's no damage reduction for it.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** There's no damage reduction against the junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** And I can roll all of these on the same turn.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:21]** The three shots go out pretty much all at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** I think it's triggered now, though.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:29]** Wasn't he delaying until I casted it on his... Yep, so that he's next in the order because of his delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:33]** And so he can then shoot.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:35]** So I'm assuming you're going to shoot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:38]** Yeah, Thaddeus needs to get on top of this junk, though, first, right?

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:40]** This, like, big block that, like...

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:42]** Yeah, it's like a barricade that can be covered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** Sorry, what?

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** This green line.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** The green line is difficult terrain.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** So I should have used different colors.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** I'm sorry.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:57]** I highlighted the edges of the dais, is that what it's called, to show where difficult terrain was with a single green line.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:03]** And then I used a thicker green line to show the aluminum screen.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:06]** So the aluminum screen is solid.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** You can't shoot through that.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:35]** though I'm not sure about energy weapons because I think energy weapons can shoot through force fields that's a different story but no this is difficult terrain anything the other light green line touches so but it is your turn you delayed a full turn so you can use your move action and then shoot okay but do if it's difficult do I have any disadvantage to firing through this towards that junk spot no because I said the dais is low enough that you can just shoot across it so there's no disadvantage that was your question yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** Difficult terrain is only when you're walking or moving through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** Fantastic.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** I will now then roll three times.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** So anyway, he started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** So anyway, then I just started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:56]** No, he blasted one time and it splits into three endowed shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:22]** down shots full-size amazing shots all right so wait so so kelly what is each roll so i i only have to roll to hit once i'm guessing right no you roll for each time okay all right all right so it's 23 for the first shot so that'll make it nice and that is a 1d8 is that correct yes yes 1d8

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** It all goes through.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:26]** Well, that's only one damage for that one, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** Okay.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:29]** So all one damage goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** This is one damage.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:35]** Then for the next shot, it's not going to hit.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** It's five, unfortunately.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** You just hear it sail by.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** The next one is an 18.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:42]** Does that hit?

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** And it has four damage.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** So there's five damage in total from these two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:47]** Okay.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** Okay, we're getting somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:52]** Then the adamantine damage, that just means that it all hits him, basically, right?

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** That's like the point of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:54]** Yes, yes.

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:59]** So adamantine, it's the DR. It basically bypasses the DR. So that is your turn.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Boom.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Boom.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:09]** It's funny because the magic is glowing at the end of the barrel, but the gun that you're shooting is a needle gun, essentially, right?

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:16]** So the dart comes out, and it basically passes through this little magic orb and turns into adamantine and then splits.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** And then two of the rounds hit, and the third one flies off.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** But all that damage went through.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:24]** It's now Chak's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:26]** Amazing.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** Chak looks back over his shoulder.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:55]** yeah good work weps let's see if i can do anything weps winks um newly inspired by uh weps vote of confidence check misses again oh uh you know what i'm gonna full round attack all right because he's missing anyway it's just better yeah i'm fishing for 20s at this point

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:58]** Nope, that's a 13.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** No, that does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Didn't catch a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:01]** Couldn't catch a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Couldn't catch a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:07]** Couldn't catch a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:13]** And now it's back to that tough true warrior, and he should be running, but he is just so involved in this.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** He's so angry that he lost his comrades.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:17]** Well, comrade.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:22]** And he wants to take this thing out because he kind of had a crush on that lieutenant.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:24]** So he's going to keep fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:26]** Oh, that's rough.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]** Because she's literally dead next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]** So he's actually going to swing twice.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:32]** That is not going to hit.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** And that doesn't hit.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:37]** So once again, he's just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:43]** On the legs and bottom torso of this junk monster.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** And it's not helping at all.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** Back to the top of the round.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:48]** Rolu, it is your turn again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:48 - 01:12:11]** roly looks back over at thaddeus and says we're gonna need more of that that was amazing and then get a full round nice little compliment from roller didn't expect that yeah you know the rare kind word from don't say i don't say anything nice about you that is just kind of suspicious now go ahead sense motive

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Rollo winks at you.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** That's fine.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** And then he turns back.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:16]** Shivers down my spine.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:18]** All right.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:20]** Going to fire two more shots.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:27]** And that is going to be a nine on one and then a 16 on the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** And you're using an energy weapon?

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** Still using energy weapon.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:32]** Does 16 go through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:34]** Second shot does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:36]** Yeah.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** That's right.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:39]** That's five more points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** All right.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:42]** At least you're putting a dent in this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** Yeah.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:51]** Rolou, I think feeling inspired by Thaddeus' incredible shot has confidence in his own ability now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** I'm just going to blush real quick.

**[01:12:54 - 01:13:02]** So this monster is at this point ignoring the creature at his feet because it's not doing anything to him.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:05]** And it gets shot again by you.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** And it's pretty angry.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** It growls in your direction.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:15]** But he's going to reach down and pick up some junk that's next to him.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:18]** And he's going to press it into his chest and crush it in there.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** What?

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** He's not healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** Surely not.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:22]** Junk repair.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:24]** No, we can't handle this kind of thing.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** This is ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** Oh, shoot the junk.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** Shoot the junk.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** Oh, my God.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:28]** Junk repair.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** Junk replace.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:33]** It's a four points of damage returned.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** So let me add that back in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** You've got to be kidding me.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** This is... Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:45]** And then he's going to take a step up onto the dais.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:46]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:51]** I feel like the dais starts to tip up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:56]** And as he does that, he did leave a threatened square.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:01]** From... And... From the true warrior.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:02]** Tony the true warrior.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:03]** Tony.

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:03]** That's his name, right?

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:04]** Hey, Tony.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:08]** Spelled... Like T-O-H-N-E-E.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** Hey, Tom.

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:09]** Hey, Tom.

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:10]** Hey, Tony.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** Hey, Tom.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** He rolled...

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:16]** 16 plus 8.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** So that hits.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:18]** Let's see.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:20]** That's a D6 plus 4.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:24]** That's 8 points of damage.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:28]** So he does 8 points minus 5 is 3 points.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:36]** So as this creature leaves, he swings one more time and hits him right in the ankle or the side of the leg and gives him 3 points of damage.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** Alright.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** Alright.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** That's the Junk Golem's turn.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** Treme, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:55]** Yeah, Treme's seeing, you know, having now the spell gems from earlier, seeing the Junk Restraints, right?

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:55]** Say again?

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** Spell Gem had Junk Restraints?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:57 - 01:15:20]** was one of the uh spell yeah gems spell gem of junk that you got um yeah i don't remember which ones you got you have to look that up but the one that is in there is a junk armor but it's spent so you're gonna pull that one out yeah put another one in i'm gonna take that as a move action okay and can i i mean i can see this guy line of sight yeah what's the range on that yeah what's the range on the spell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:38]** 30 per five feet per two levels so what level was the spell gem junk restraints is a level four spell yeah dang right that's rad yeah you can shoot that from across it too that's so then the range would be close 35 weapon or 35 feet right yeah 35 feet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:38 - 01:16:05]** yep dude i think you're you were right on the money too because this thing just stepped onto the dais on like the southeast corner of the dais and uh termay is on the northwest corner of the platform next to it perfect 35 feet dude so i mean if that's all good i think kevin okay so so the junk junk restraints is what you're casting and with the uh with the gem yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:07]** It does get a reflex save.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:11]** So I'm going to say the junk spells do go through.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:11]** Nice.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:14]** Let me find my reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:26]** So what I'm trying to do basically, what I would hope would be to turn that junk that he just put into his chest to repair.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:29]** Obviously, this is just like flavor.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:34]** It's not mechanically because it's already healed him four points.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:59]** or it four points but it would be taking that nearby junk to restrain the creature amazing all right so i'm gonna do a reflex save against that it is dc 21 plus one and a half times your caster level but your caster level is four right yeah that does not pass so what does this do again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:04]** You are entangled for the duration of the spell, which is two rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:05]** Two rounds.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:07]** I am entangled.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:08]** I forget what entangled means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:09]** Move at half speed.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:11]** Can't run or charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:16]** And minus two penalty to AC and attack rolls and a bunch of other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:18]** Minus two to AC and attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:18]** Yeah.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:21]** And reflex save and deck space skills.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:24]** Plus you were already off target, weren't you?

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** I thought that was only for the one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:29]** Yeah, that was only for one round.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]** Sounds right.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:30]** Okay.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:31]** Yeah.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** So this is for two rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:35]** Okay, so he's a minus two on ACs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:36]** And on attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Yeah.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:39]** And on attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:40]** Take that.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** We're in round four, right?

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** Yes.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:44]** Okay.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:49]** So this round, he's still off target, I think, because this round is when I crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:53]** Well, he swung at the other guy, right, and missed anyways.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** Yeah.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:57]** No, he didn't do any attacks on this return because he picked up the junk.

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:57]** Yep.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** Two rounds for two rounds.

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:01]** Two rounds, minus two for two rounds.

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:04]** This might help you some.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** All right.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:10]** And it is now confused for 1D four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:13]** Let's stack these effects up, boy.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:15]** Dude, let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:16]** Four rounds.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:18]** Oh, my God.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:20]** So confused.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:29]** A confused creature automatically moves to attack the creature that last attacked it and can only take AOLs against a PC that attacked it.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:31]** So you can walk through its square without being attacked.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:32]** Nice.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:33]** It is confused.

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:37]** I roll a fortitude save after every turn for that.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:37]** Nice.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:39]** Okay.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:39]** All right.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:41]** How did it get confused?

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:44]** Because that's what junk spells do.

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:44]** Okay.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:46]** All right.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** All right.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:50]** Thaddeus, it is now your turn in the new initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:51]** Okay.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:51]** Yeah.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:54]** So Thaddeus is going to get up on this dais.

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:58]** And in order to move through this typical terrain, he has to do something, right?

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:59]** Make a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:02]** No, you just do, you waste a move basically.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:04]** It's two moves for everyone.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** So he's only going to really end up here.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:08]** And I'm just checking one thing real quick.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:10]** Well, he might as well try.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:11]** So he's going to shoot him.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:17]** So he takes out... Actually, though, he has his dashiko equipped.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:17]** So I don't know.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:20]** Can I, like, shoot from my other hand if I had my gun out already?

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:21]** Or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:23]** Is your gun a two-handed weapon?

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:25]** Because a dashiko is definitely a two-handed weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:26]** I was going to say, the dashiko is definitely two-handed.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:27]** Oh, no, then he can't do anything.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:28]** Yeah, it is.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:29]** Sad day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** You can... Yeah.

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:34]** Your whole move would be moving, switching weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:36]** Oh, well, then I could do a double move then.

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:38]** Okay, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:40]** Well, you have a free... Base attack bonus.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:47]** Yeah, you have a base attack bonus that lets you do a free... So you could drop your dash go and pull out a gun while you're moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:48]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:57]** Because it's a free action to drop and a move action to pull, but you get a free pull because you have a base attack bonus that's high enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:57 - 01:20:02]** Thaddeus switches to his Tactical Fortium Venomcaster.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:05]** And he's going to shoot this guy.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** Or he's going to try.

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:09]** It's 19, so it will... It's dark in there!

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:09]** Shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** A 19 hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:13]** What damage do you do?

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:15]** Once again, it's 1 damage because it's 6 minus 5, right?

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:17]** I have 6 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:18]** Oh, yes.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** It's 6 minus 5 for 1 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:21]** Is it energy?

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:22]** What are you firing?

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** It's kinetic damage.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Yeah, I only have kinetic rounds left.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:26]** Gotcha.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:27]** It's a Tactical Fortium Venomcaster.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:29]** Yeah, you did something to it.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:30]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:32]** You could wait until a cast again.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** That's another option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:36]** How many casts do you have of that?

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** That's something we'll ask next time.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:40]** This is the end of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:42]** I've never heard you end a game like this.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** The way you just did it.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** Well, this is the end.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:46]** Well, this is the end.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:47]** It's late for me, man.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** I want to go to bed.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:49]** That was pretty fun, man.

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:51]** Just keep the junk away from this guy.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** I hate that healing ability.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:54]** Yeah, that sucks.

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:54]** But interesting enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:58]** This is the BBEG, the Big Bad Evil Golem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:03]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:10]** Until next week, drift beguiles and distant stars.
