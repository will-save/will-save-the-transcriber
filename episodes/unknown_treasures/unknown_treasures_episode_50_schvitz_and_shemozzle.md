**[00:00:02 - 00:00:03]** Hey, you bilge rats.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:12]** This is Thaddeus with another episode of Cooking with Thaddeus, streaming to you live as we do every week on Wednesdays.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:19]** Today, we have a very special recipe from my newest cookbook, Cottage Classics of Castorville.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:22]** It's called Frog Moth Stew.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:28]** The frog moth is one of the deep swapland's most ferocious and monstrous predators.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:32]** Capable of catching and eating dinosaurs and even dragons.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:37]** Yes, the frogmouth is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:45]** But thankfully for us and our taste buds, not as effective a hunter as I am.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** As you can see, it's also quite huge.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:53]** So get a matey to help you prepare it.

**[00:00:54 - 00:01:01]** First, we take out the guts, and then we chop off its big kickers right there.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** Then we remove its head.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:11]** This brings back memories from VESC 6.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** Oh, I'm being told we have to go to a commercial.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:17]** Really?

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Already?

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** Here.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Look here, right?

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** Okay, okay.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Fine.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Got it.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** Hmm.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:47]** Hmm.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:50]** Well, listeners, you heard the doer.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:55]** I'll add that for you free captains out there, you especially should participate.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** So make sure you do.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:03]** Unless, of course, you're a traitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:28]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Get in.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Restore balance.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Get out.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:47]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I'm Kevin, your host for Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** Unknown Treasures!

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** This is episode 50.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** I said 50.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** That's a big number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** How many episodes were we originally going to be playing this for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** I still got the paper right here to remind me.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** It's 13.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** 13 episodes it's supposed to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Yeah, dude, no way.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** At one point, we were like, ah, it might be 26.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** I remember we said that.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** And then it wasn't.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Yeah, about that.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** It became an entire year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** Good thing I thought it was only going to be 13 episodes, so I did all of my prep.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Within 13 weeks.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Right.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** So I want to remind the listeners because I know they've been listening for a long time and might have forgotten.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:02]** We are, in fact, playing Junker's Delight written by Jason Keeley and Misha Bushyager.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Bushyager?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Is that how you say it?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Bushyager.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Is that right?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** I feel like you've nailed their name.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** You've been confident for a while.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** So if it's not, then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:17]** I'm terrible with reading.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** You could ask John.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** I'm terrible with names and spelling and reading and all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** He still calls me Juan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** You know what else I'm also bad at?

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** What?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Cooking.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** I'm terrible at cooking.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** I'm sure we talked about this.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:35]** I get major anxiety in the kitchen and I found out today my son is already a better cook than I am.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:42]** My two and a half, almost three year old son cooked macaroni and cheese with his mom today and he did most of the work.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** And I can't even do that sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** You can't cook mac and cheese?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** Stop it.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Don't judge me.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** No, I'm just asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** I've never done that recently.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** I can give you tips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** I've messed it up on occasions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** How do you mess up mac and cheese?

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:04]** When you're the dad, you want your kids to be better than you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It's a good thing.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** He's on the fast track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:12]** You're going to be one of those dads who's challenging your kid to everything, trying to kick his ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:18]** That's actually one of my favorite things about my son and having a little kid in the house is that even when I do something terribly, he goes...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** good job, daddy.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** Thank you.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:31]** I don't, you have no idea how bad I messed this up, but like we, we installed a toilet and like, you know, it went well, but like there were some hiccups and he was just like, good job, daddy.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** You installed toilet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** Thank you.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** Your own little like cheerleader mascot, dude.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Yeah.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** But it, it, it totally goes both ways though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:44]** You probably do that with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** No, if he does something terrible, I tell him, no, that's terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Wow.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** Lauren was also criticizing me while they were in the kitchen.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:34]** I was in the kitchen with them, and we were talking about boiling water, and I was telling Grayson, like, oh, it boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 100 degrees Celsius.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Depending on your altitude.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** He's a little young for that.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** You don't need to.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** This is not the time.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Go off into the mountains, my child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** I've tested.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** I just want him to yell.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** Like, I taught him something green as people.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** He says that all the time.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** So now I want him to just yell randomly.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** Water boils at 212 degrees.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:56]** And then explain Fahrenheit at certain elevations and pressures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Amazing.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** You should tell them all the values for one standard temperature and pressure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** That's it.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** And then all the other kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:06]** Anyways, how are you guys doing?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** What's new?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** How's life?

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** What other kids, John?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** There are no other kids.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** What?

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** No, no, definitely no other kids.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** Definitely no other kids.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** How are your kids?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** I do have two kids.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** I actually had a really, really sweet.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:27]** So my my wife and daughter went to Tallahassee for the weekend to go to the actually you guys would be really interested in this.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** Florida State has like a magnetics lab.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:36]** like a, a, a far field magnetics research facility and they're opening it up to the public this week.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** And so they're going to go down there and do a bunch of, uh, uh, game themed experiments.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** There's giant magnetic operation.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** Um, Whoa, there's some Mario type stuff.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:57]** And then on the way back, they're going to hit up like city and, uh, they're doing like one of those, uh, lantern festivals, like in, in the Tangled, Tangled, Tangled, Tangled.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Yeah, it was entangled.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** The whole song is at last I see the light and...

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:09]** They release lanterns every year on her birthday, on Rapunzel's birthday.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** So yeah, they're going to go to a festival in Lake City on the way back tomorrow.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** This is an all-boys weekend.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:22]** I don't know what I'm going to do with Bud Bud other than put him to bed, which I did about a half hour ago.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** I might cook mac and cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** I make a dope mac and cheese.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** Do you throw different cheeses in?

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** I love a smoked Gouda heavy mac and cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Smoked Gouda heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** I love a smoked cheese.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** I like a smoked Gouda especially.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:45]** What I haven't done yet is I haven't made a mac and cheese on my Traeger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** And I think that additional smoke... Is this possible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** I'm sure it is.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** I'm going to try it.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** I've heard of this power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** I've seen it.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I've yet to wield it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:01]** Some might deem it unnatural.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Yeah, I think that's what we're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:10]** You know, I have to say recently I've had either hatch chili or green pepper in my mac and cheese.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** That hatch, man.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Dude, so good.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Hatch, really?

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Yeah, hatch chili or green pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** Never had it.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** So good.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** I'll have to get some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:45]** yeah so i've got like five degrees i actually put some wings on like two and a half hours ago i used to live in new mexico and uh we would go to chili rust and it was amazing because you get your chili roasted and then it it smokes it's it's not and then you have to peel it and your hands burned and it's it's a lot of uh

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:49]** It's a lot involved, but it's a lot of work.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:52]** And it's very much worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** To any listeners in New Mexico, can we come to your chili roast?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** A listener's going to put on some roast?

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:58]** Yes.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:58]** That would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Probably in, like, August.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** All right.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** We'll save it for August.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Yeah.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** After Scotland.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** I'm in.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:09]** I'm in.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Scotland!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Scotland!

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Scotland!

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Scotland!

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** The listeners aren't privy to that information yet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** No, that was a preview.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** Maybe we'll post something in the future.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Future us's.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Take note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:27]** Yep.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** We'll save Invades Europe.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Wow.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Take it over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** All the words you could have used.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** I like it.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Invades was a choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** I mean, it felt right.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:42]** The United Kingdom is kind of known for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** That's very true.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** We're colonizing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** Is that what you're saying?

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Wow.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Whoa.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Are we reverse colonizing?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Yeah.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** We're here to free you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:43 - 00:12:09]** continental europe but they they don't consider themselves partly which i guess europe yeah yeah the other my my wife's friend's uh boyfriend is from uh north of manchester and he he was going all of i i was asking him about uh lock stock two smoking barrels and snatch and the whole like cockney thing and he was telling like i think he said his grandmother speaks almost strictly cockney and i was like wow that's that's cool that's

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Yeah, he was giving us some examples.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** I think it was dog and bone for phone.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** And I was like, that's confusing enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** There is the cockney rhyme.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Yes.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** Yes.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** The cockney rhyming slang.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** It's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:25]** It's pretty awesome.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Barney rubble trouble.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Yeah.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** It's pretty neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Speaking of trouble.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Let's play an open flame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:35]** That was my flaming noises.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Are you guys ready to play?

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** Alright, we're playing... That was a wild banter.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** We were all over.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** We were here, there, we were across the pond.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** It's like we were all globetrotting.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Kev, do you want the recap music?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Not quite.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:56]** Before we start, I want to get your guys' inputs.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** What's going on?

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:03]** I want your characters' input on what is the status of your mission?

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** Let's just go over the original purpose of this mission.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** Why are you guys on Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:12]** I mean, this has been the definition of scope creep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Easily.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** We are not good managers of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** No, they should have sent us down with the project manager.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** Our PM really dropped the ball on this.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Is our PM Goldhorn?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** No, I'm joking, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:40]** Yeah, because we were sent down to reclaim this area for our captain and went on a wild goose chase.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:49]** So the order given to Torme was actually eliminate Dotrulu, find the riddle, draw him out.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:52]** And I think so far you could check off two of the three of those.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:11]** You found the riddle, which was a riddle, and you were able to go along with her to track down Vahri 13 and save Vahri 13 and then use Vahri 13's excursion to draw out the true warriors.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** The only thing you guys got to do now is eliminate Dotrulu.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** He hasn't shown up yet.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** But you guys are under siege within the Stellar Flare.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** You're trapped there.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** So let me recap.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** You're recapping?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** Last time.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Oh, okay.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Yeah, now you can hit the music.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Okay.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** So last time, you fought off the first wave of the true warriors.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Torme shot and killed the first Yusuke.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:40]** Well, I guess technically the second Yusuke after he was hit by the turret and then a proximity grenade.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:47]** Rolu and Chalk ran to the east side of the map and they met up with normal human true warrior number one.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:54]** Choc shot him first, and then Rolu obliterated his mind with Day's weariness.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** Then a tough true warrior snuck up, quote unquote, and was blinded by a flash grenade.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** Being blinded, he still got in on a hit on Torme before he was blasted by Choc and then finally killed by Thaddeus.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** You got a second.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:17]** Not a whole ten minutes, but you got a second before that next wave of true warriors came in.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:28]** And when they did, it was a tough true warrior leading the charge with a steel plate to block all the turret's fire, while Yasuki slipped in and disconnected that turret, disabling it.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** That's right.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:38]** And then a female human stepped up underneath that disabled turret into that first intersection of the hallway, and she raised her fist up.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** So let me take you back to the map!

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** The map!

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** The map!

**[00:15:42 - 00:16:10]** fireworks and all that fun stuff fireworks bam yeah fireworks yeah okay yes all right so we leave off it is it is that true warrior's turn she has an air of authority about her as she holds her fist up no um i just i need to do something real quick let me roll this

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Yep, uh-huh.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** She makes a series of hand gestures.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** Torme and Thaddeus, you're kind of the only ones you can almost see her.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:21]** She's right at the edge of your vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** I can see her.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** She doesn't appear to be Tez Tronin.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** She's definitely... It's dim.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:33]** So you don't think it's Tess Turner from what you can see, but what I'm saying is you also can't really see what she's doing.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:48]** She's just far enough away, and there's a little bit of blockage between the walls, but she draws her fist up, and then she draws her hand flat across her neck and points down towards the ground in the middle of that hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Is she choking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** She then raises her two fingers up.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** She points to the left, and she then spins her two fingers straight up in the air.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** twisting her wrist.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** She repeats that, but this time she does only one finger.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** She points in the opposite direction and then she spins that finger around.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:09]** Then she's going to raise her auto target rifle.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** And I was debating whether or not she'd cover fire or take a shot.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** I think I'm just going to take a shot.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** But you do have some cover.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** What's the question?

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Sorry, there's no question.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** I'm just reacting.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** I heard a what?

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Yeah, I'm just being the peanut gallery.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** Oh.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** Well, she raises up her auto-target rifle.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** So she can see us.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** She can see you as much as you can see her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Okay.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** I can't see her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, I can't see her either.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** And I checked it.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** You do have some cover.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Who is you?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** You, as in Tremé and Thaddeus.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** You're right.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** So Tremé and Thaddeus are up zigzagging through those hallways.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:43]** Yeah.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** But there is a line of sight between them.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** And so I will give you a plus 40 or AC for cover.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:55]** And she's only human and it's dim light, so she will have a 20% missed chance.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:59]** But she's going to take a shot at Thaddeus.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** No, I take the back.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** She's going to take a shot at Torme.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** She's going to take a shot at Torme.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** You get a plus four.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** It's going to be KAC.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** And that is... I got to do math here.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** It's an ungodly number.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** It's a 23 to hit.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** Even with your plus four?

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Yeah.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:29]** Okay, so now I'll roll that D100.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:38]** So... It's a 90 on the dice.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** So that hits.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:45]** I rolled... She gets a 20% concealment because it's dim light.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Got it.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** Yeah, so anything less than 20 she missed.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** Okay, so that is now going to be...

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Six points of damage.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** That hurt.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** She takes a shot.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** It echoes through the sounds of the hallways.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** What are you doing?

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** Thaddeus can see her with his sharp cat eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** I don't think he has any sort of mischance.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** I'm guessing, right, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** You don't have any missed chance, but there would still be cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Okay.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** Cool.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** So how much are we talking?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Plus four in this case?

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** It would be a plus four, yeah.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** All right.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** He's going to attempt a shot.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:29]** In that case, he's not going to try to take a full action, if I'm understanding the best way to do this.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:36]** So he's going to fire a single shot of his Venom Caster at her.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** Ah, it's 13 to hit.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** So... EAC or KAC?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Oh, there's a plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** It misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Yeah.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** That's a miss.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** And that's your whole turn, or are you going to move now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:58]** He's going to move out of range of her before coming back and try again.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** So he moves off to the right, into the right way, high right hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** But ready to strike again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Okay.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Rolu, you're up.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Oh, great.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:17]** So I probably see these shots go by one from somebody.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:21]** We don't know that this is Test Runner, at least Chuck and I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:25]** I don't know if you see these shots because these are like kinetic rounds.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:28]** So you probably just hear the gunfire and you don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** Okay.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** So to us, it feels like we're still just in the same place we were.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** This doesn't feel like anything new per se.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** They're not coming up the hallway yet.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Are there any other doors in this hallway?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:47]** I don't recall, and I can't see on the map here, which probably reflects Rolo not being able to see much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:58]** In the hallway that you're standing in, which you guys are off to the east side on that first or the second hallway up, if you think about it ladder-wise, there are four hallways before the lab.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Is there four?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Yeah.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** So you're in the second hallway up.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:06]** There is a door about 20 feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:31]** i can't click sorry i'm on 20 feet away yeah got it got it yep and then there's another door uh over about further 50 feet 60 feet yeah further and that's got it and then yeah i think it's the is that what you're asking those are the doors yes those are the doors great okay roll is going to do another quick peek if that's a five foot step over and back

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** on the hallway that he's right next to to see that there's nobody coming down the hallway.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:45]** And then he's going to say, Shaq, I think it's best if we get into the middle of this hallway so we can be prepared and maybe take them by surprise.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** So he's going to move 20 feet down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** Yeah, what if we...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:50 - 00:22:04]** go through one of these doors and like sneak through to the other side they would never see that coming all right he thinking quickly i think i've used 30 feet of movement kev to get to check around the corner and come back yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** It doesn't take 30 feet of movement to do just that, but yes.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** So you're saying you are standing at the doorway's entrance with your 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** Yes, and I'm going to sneak in, which is another 30 feet.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** So that's two move actions.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Okay.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** And I don't see anybody.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** I'm going to move 10 feet into the room, and I don't see anybody on the other side of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:34]** Rolu is now in the middle of that storage area where you found all those fun pieces of items that I presented you.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** The scrolls and the spell gems.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:42]** You are now standing in the middle of that room, and it is now a true warrior's turn.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:50]** So this true warrior is a little Yusuke, the one that disconnected the turret, and he is going to move up.

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:03]** into the hallway and reach down to where the woman pointed and it's a natural 20, uh, to disable that proximity mind.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:07]** Uh, so he's able to just disconnect and completely disarm.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** Uh, this, this is this one was a frag grenade.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:10]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Frag mark two.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** That frag mark two is gone.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Just shoot the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** It's gone or it's just sitting there.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** So he destroyed it, like disabled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Yeah, he disabled it.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Let's not get into that.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** I don't know.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:29]** If you want to read about what disabling means, I just rolled a natural 20.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** Well, I guess my only question would be, is there still a Mark II grenade to pick up?

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** And this is not a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** I'm going to let you look that up because I have no idea and I'm moving on.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Okay.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** So that is the end of the Yosuke's turn.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:43]** Okay.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** So this next one is a human true warrior.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Okay.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:53]** He is going to cut in and move to the left of the map.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** But you characters don't know that.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Termay, you're up.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:06]** So seeing these jokers come down the hallway and disable my device.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** I thought I readied an action, but that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** You readied an action to shoot somebody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** Yeah, or, you know, act, but it's fine.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** I don't recall.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Sorry.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:22]** No, it's totally fine.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** I just want to see what my movement can be.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** What can your movement be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** It can be anything it wants to be.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:48]** yeah yeah believe yourself expecting that thing to go off but that's fine self-confidence self-confidence believe yeah so uh i'm gonna move up thaddeus and uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:52]** Give him a little bit of the witchcraft over here.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** And I'm going to cast a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** You're going to zigzag.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** You're in that weird zigzag intersection, so you're moving down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:04]** Yeah, I want to make sure that I'm in enough range to get this off.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** But I am going to cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:15]** So you're now in the same hallway as the Soki, the lieutenant, and a couple of other true warriors, but they look like they're much further back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:21]** Yeah, so at the entrance of this area, there is a sort of zigzag hallway.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:33]** Anyhow, I'm now at the end of that zigzag hallway at this sort of T section, although it's more like a cross because around the corner there's another hallway.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** But gosh, is there a way to draw a circle from the center in Roll20?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** No idea.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** So what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:58]** I'm casting Wall of Steam in a radius around these two foes, this lieutenant and this poor Yosuke who's about to get fried.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:16]** wall of steam what is the range on that range is 25 feet plus 5 feet for every 2 levels and you can do a 20 foot long or a ring with a radius of 5 feet per level so level 2 would be 10 feet so 10 feet radius


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Five feet for two levels.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Yeah.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Makes sense.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Ten feet.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** I'm going to move it to where I think it should go.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Right in there.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** Oh.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** That seem right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Perfect.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Okay.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Yep.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Then that works.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** And what is the DC for this?

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** I get a fortitude save or something?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Saving throw?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** No.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** No saving throw.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** No spell resistance.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Nothing you can do.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** Great.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:40 - 00:27:08]** 3d4 damage if i cast it on you inside the circle and um if you try to pass through it it's uh 3d4 uh if you're within 10 feet of the walls so right now it's pointed in so i would say that the person at the scanner is free to move and not be uh hurt but if they go step through the threshold for the

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** Or no, actually it's four rounds.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Four rounds.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** Then they have to take 3d4 damage.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** And then on the inside after this spell,

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:25]** Each round they get within 10 feet, 1d4, within 5 feet, 2d4 damage per round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Okay.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:29]** So the characters that are inside of that are going to take damage now, you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Yes.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** 3d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** And how much damage did it take?

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** 3d4?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** I don't see where it says.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** It says 3d4 if you're passing through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:39]** In addition, the wall deals 3d4 damage to any creature passing through it.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:46]** If you conjure the wall so that it appears where the creatures are, each character takes damage as if passing through the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** It's the very last sentence of the first paragraph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** If you're within 5 feet... I see 3d4 for passing through.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** I see 2d4 for within 5 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** I literally just read it.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:03]** In addition, the wall deals 3d4 damage to any creature passing through it.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** If you conjure...

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:11]** Same sentence or sorry, there's a period but if you conjure the wall so that it appears where the creatures are Each creature takes damage as a passing through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:17]** So we'll take 3d for so the creature that's passing through it is the Yosuke But they know they're not passing through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** I just I just did it on them, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:28]** And there's a line that says when you do it on them It is the same as if they are passing through it So they take the same day and and so the wall of this steam is the circle and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** And so that's the Yosuke.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:36]** And then if you're within five feet of that wall, that would be the lieutenant.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** So the lieutenant only takes 2d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:44]** I think given that I cast it around her...

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** with her in it.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Whatever.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** It's fine.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Your call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I'm reading this as much as you are, dude.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** I'm trying to figure this out.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Can we get an agreement on it?

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** Who else is reading it the way that I am?

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** I can't see what's going on.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Is it 3D4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** I sent it to the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** All right.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** What's the disagreement on like 2D4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** Creatures within five feet of the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Okay, I'm going to move my character.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:15]** Creatures within five feet of this side of the wall will take 2D4 damage and those beyond five feet, but within 10 feet.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** We just, we paused the whole battle in Rolu and Chuck walk over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Guys, guys, hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Let me help.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Let me help here.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** The wall deals this damage when it appears on... All right, let's figure this out.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** Let's get on the ground and start reading it together.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** The wall deals 3d4 damage to any creature passing through it.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** If you conjure the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** So are they within the circle or without it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** Yeah, it's basically a circle.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** With the ring radius.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Where are all the enemies?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** With the effect scalding fog up to 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:55]** So, like, I've held up the lid for the little thing on my desk, but it's a circle, right?

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:00]** So, like, if this is the wall, any creature on that line takes 3D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Sure.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** Any creature five feet away from that line takes 2D4.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** 2D4.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** And then further out, 1D4 for 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Further out, 1D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:12]** If I'm in the middle, I'm five feet away from the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Which would put me at 2d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** This side of the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Right, so 2d4.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** That's what I was saying.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** The lieutenant takes 2d4.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** The Yosuke takes...

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Oh, you guys can't see it either.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I can't see it.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** The lieutenant is five feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** I'm just listening to the description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** And the Yosuke is on the edge.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** So I'll say the Yosuke takes three, the lieutenant takes two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:36]** I think the fundamental disagreement is, does the steam come from the circle or does it come from the whole area?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** I think I can answer it.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** I think it comes from the perimeter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** I'm not sure that that is the case.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** It says if you conjure the wall itself.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Okay, so.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** You pick a side of the wall.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** Got it.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** of which it comes off.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** So either pointing in or pointing out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:55]** It's not like an, it's not an AOE ascent into the purest sense where it like covers the entire area.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Like it's like, right.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** I got it.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** I see.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** And I'm also a very slow reader.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** So like, so is it steaming inside or outside the circle?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Inside.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:16]** All right, so the steam is coming inside from the circle that you made, and that circle, the wall of the circle, is touching the Yusuke.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** The Yusuke's going to take 3d4 damage right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Yeah, just, well, three threes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** All right, it's pretty respectable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** I got to do math on that.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** That's nine.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** All right.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** And then the lieutenant is standing almost dead center of that circle.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** It's five feet away.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** She is only going to take 2d4 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** Sorry, I rolled a three and a two, so that's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Five points of damage towards her.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:54]** And they have a 20% additional concealment from this fog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** So it's whatever the highest percentage is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** All right.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** That is an excellent spell.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** And that is your whole turn, Treme, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Dang.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Cool.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** It is now this other true warrior's turn.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:24]** He's kind of just stopped by that steam, and he's kind of afraid to do anything about it.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:27]** But you are within sight.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:34]** He is going to draw out his azimuth laser pistol and take a shot at Termay.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** So you're going to get a 20% chance, missed chance on that.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** It's a 23 to hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** So now I need to roll my mischance.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** That's a 90 on the die.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** So that hits.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:59]** You're going to take... That's only two points of damage.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** You take two points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Hang in there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** And now, Chuck, it is your turn.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:33]** um chalk is going to he burned his move action staying on rolu's shoulder um so i think he's going to menacingly cock his light that's fault blaster and look right down the sights i'm gonna ready a fire action for anyone i see uh that might pass across the southern open door into this hallway


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** All right.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** That sounds fun.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** We'll see if that happens.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:44]** It is now this other true warrior's turn, and he's kind of in that same boat.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:51]** He runs up right behind the tough true warrior that's standing in front of that steam, and he's like, what the f***, dude?

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** And the true warrior, the big tough one, just kind of raises his hands like, I don't know.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:01]** And so he's going to step next to that guy, and he's going to take a shot at Torme, because Torme's the only one that he can see.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:04]** You're kind of out of his range, so I'm going to do a perception check.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Roll me a stealth check.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** And I'm just going to make him opposed.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** We got to look at what his perception is first.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Because it is dark in here and there's steam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** It's dark in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** I got a 15 on my stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:18]** 15.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** 15 on your stealth check.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** This guy is going to have...

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** It's a four.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** He's got a plus four, so it's a 16 perception.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** So that beats your stealth.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** So he knows you're there.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:36]** He's going to raise up his pulse caster pistol, which I didn't know this, but pulse caster pistols are always non-lethal.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** That's now you know.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:42]** But he pulls out his pulse caster pistol.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** I can't say it anymore.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** And he's going to take a shot at you.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** That's a 17 to hit.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Yeah.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** Okay, and that's going to be a 20% missed chance again.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** 50 on the die this time.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** So that's pass.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:11]** So you're going to take three points of non-lethal energy damage.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** Dang.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** That is the end of that round.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** We're into round number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:23]** Is this the most damage that you've ever taken in this episode so far?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** In this series?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** It looks like a Fox game of pretty good running.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Oh, yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** I went down two on the... That's right.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** The rad monster or whatever.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** I found the kayads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Oh, in the kayads.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** Are you that close to going down?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Yes.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** This is now...

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:53]** It's now the lieutenant's turn, and she's within this steam, but she's going to just push her way out of it.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:59]** And say, passing through the steam, she's going to take 3d4 of damage.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** So she's going to move outside of the steam.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** Is there any limitations to movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** From it?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Okay, so she steps outside.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** Give me 3d6 or 3d4 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** All right.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Ouch.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:25]** That was her movement action, but right before she did that, she used a standard action and said, you better stay in this.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Don't you go down.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:33]** As she steps out of that steam, and she's going to give the Yosuke five points of health.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** That was very kind of her.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** No.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** Yeah.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** That was so nice of her.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** I still can't do simple math.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Okay.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Cool.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** That was annoying of her.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:52]** Thaddeus peeks around the corner and is going to take a shot at the Yusoki.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** He wants to end this gentle creature's life.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** All right, here we go.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Shit.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** God damn it.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** What did you roll?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Just a 10.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Just a 10.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:13]** I have such a modifier for my range attacks, which means I'm rolling it very low indeed.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Wow, that's really sad.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:20]** So Thaddeus, it just kind of grazes the ear of the Hisoki.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** And that's it.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** He's like, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** Which technically, that would have hit you still.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** Still would have had a 20% missed chance because of the steam.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** I'm just saying.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Okay.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** But you missed, so it doesn't even matter.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Rolly, what are you doing?

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Just hanging out in that room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Yeah, just totally hanging out.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:46]** No, I think hearing all these shots, he's going to say, are you all right?

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** How's it going in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Uh, they're at the end of this hallway.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** They're held back for the moment.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:57]** They, uh, disabled this, uh, grenade I had set up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:57]** There's two of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:02]** It looks like there's a Yosuke I can make out through the steam, and there's a true warrior female.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** All right.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** Shaq, I think we need to assist them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** It would be helpful if you could flank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Right, cop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** They're bunched up.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Maybe throw a grenade.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** That's your specialty.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** I don't have that.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** I don't have it.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:28]** All right, so Rulu's going to start taking just a five-foot measured step, gun trained forward, trying to keep an eye on what is happening.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:47]** And as he's stepping forward, he one hand kind of switches off his comms or just covers his mic and he says to Chuck, Chuck, you know that that object that you have in your pants...

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:54]** It's very important that it goes to good people.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** And I'm out the door now.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Looking left, I just looked right.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:06]** And then looking left, don't see anybody in the hallway.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:11]** I see some people down at the other end, but I can't quite make them out, Kev.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** I don't know if you're going to...

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:19]** On the left side of the hallway, I see a marker with a red X, so probably dead, and two people, I think, standing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** So what Rollo would see is almost shadows.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:29]** He just sees the dark outline of two figures in the hallway street in front of him if he's looking to the west.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** Okay.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:35]** I'm not sure if you'd be able to see the other ones because they're kind of around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Yeah, I don't think I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** I guess you kind of see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** Chuck, from his angle, can see.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Chuck, do you see them?

**[00:39:42 - 00:40:06]** uh yeah i see a couple there's a there's a tough one there's a normal one just came in the front door and there's one i think on the uh let's play this true to the world and i'm gonna roll on this chance to see if chuck can indeed see these people through the fog nice

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** 22, so yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** I can just barely make somebody out on the other side of this fog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** So is that a double movement, Roloo?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** No.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** That was just all one movement.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** You still have a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** One movement.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** Yeah, I still have a standard action.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Can I use it to chat with Shock?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** To strategize with Shock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Is that you're using your standard Jackson to strategize?

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Well, I just want to have a conversation.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** My tongue is tied tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** It's all right.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** It's all right.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** So have your conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** It's free actions to talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:40]** Shock, do you think that we should spring the trap right now or get closer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** We should probably get closer.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** I've only got 20 feet on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:48 - 00:41:07]** so rolu is going to stay you said that they're around the fog to the left too so let's move across quickly steps across the hall trying to lean back and then slowly move up maybe 20 feet to just outside the light ray

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:16]** trying to stay stealthy from them and not expose him and chalk to the people around the corner.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** So that's two move actions.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:26]** So I can't really ready an action, but I could see if I could hide, but they will probably see me if they have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:34]** Hey, you remember, you remember that lady from the, from the desert, the one that exploded in sunlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Oh yeah.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** I'm pretty sure that's her.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Well, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Yeah.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Okay.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Noted.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Well, that's all that my movement is.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** So there's no going back, Tuck, unless you're going to leave.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:58]** So Rolu is going to have his rifle ready to go.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** And that's my turn.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** And two hams also ready to go, possibly with a spell if needed.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** Why don't you give me a stealth check for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** How dare you ask that of me?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** What?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:18]** the gall, the audacity that you have to ask that very basic question in which I clearly nail it with a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I don't even have to look up the...

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** No, I'm going to roll perception against that.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** I almost got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** I did not make it.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Did not make it.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** I had a nine.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** So you are hidden.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** The question is, how will Chalk handle that round?

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Because he technically, does he get two move actions by saving his move?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Just think about this until we get there.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** And also, does he have to do a stealth check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** I thought we established it was a move to stay mounted.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Stay?

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Okay.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** All right.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** All fair.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** That's fair.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** So a single move.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:52]** It is now the Yosuke's turn.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** The one is standing in the barrier.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** Another question about this spell is he's technically already passing through the border.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Does he take damage as he steps out of the border?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Okay.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** So then he's going to step out of the border towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Great spell, dude.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Great spell.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** 3d4.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** It's a second level spell.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** That's why it's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** It's dope.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I hope you roll low.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** That was...

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** 10 points.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** That's right.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Steamed Yosuke's on the menu, boys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:42]** He raises up his gun, and he was kind of kneeled down when he disabled the thing, and so as that wall came up, he stood up, and he's pulling his gun out, and he steps forward towards you, and he draws it up and points it at you, but that steam is just burning at him, and he can't hold on any longer, and he falls dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** Nice.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Nice.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** That looks good.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Thaddeus would say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** I mean, it could be pretty tasty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:59]** It's pretty cool to see this wall steam and then just like a body falls out of it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** It's still only the second round, right?

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Yeah.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** Yeah.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** That's it.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Love it.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** And those guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** I thought.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** It might be the second round, never mind.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** I haven't gone yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** You haven't gone yet?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** So it's the first round.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** That's what I mean.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** There was the first round, which is when it would start, right?

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** On your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** Yeah, so on my turn, it'll be the second round.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** Love it.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Cool.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** What?

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Love it.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Oh, love it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:36]** John, you keep shouting things, and I'm like, what?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** What are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I'm just keeping the energy going.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** Why are you getting so crazy?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** All right.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:46]** So this true warrior right here to the west, it is now their turn.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:50]** They are going to take a shot at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Oh, I just did the John Cena.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** You can't see me.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** They can't see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** So they don't even recognize that you're there.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** You're right.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Good call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** It's an RKO out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Yeah.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Yeah.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** Is the turquoise line that I'm seeing on the map the wall of steam?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Yeah.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Okay.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** That's what I thought.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** It's centered around the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** You can go right up to it from the outside and not get burned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Okay.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** All right.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:28]** Uh, so that true warrior is going to just disappear, uh, from sight for you guys, for the listener.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:36]** He moved up into the, the, like the dining area, that mess area where Rulu first heard the ghosts.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** Um, and to me, it's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** I don't know if I can barely make out some people over there.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** Maybe I could coax them into coming through this wall.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Uh,

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:52]** I mean, they wouldn't feel the heat from where they are.

**[00:45:53 - 00:46:01]** So maybe if I could get something off into their area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** Into the area, area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Maybe not.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** Okay.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** I think I saw them go down this way.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** I might cut through this...

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** This ghost area we saw earlier stay frosty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Yeah.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:20]** All right.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** So I'm going to go up to the, uh, the door, open it.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** I guess.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:30]** Is that my full move or is that movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** Plus that'd be two movements.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** It's a movement to move to the door and it's a movement to open the door.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** So you are opening the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** So I'm not going to open the door.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** Actually.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Can I retcon that?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Sorry.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** what you gonna do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** I just want to double check the range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Getting that old range finder.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** There's a laser that appears.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** It's like a gun, but it's actually just a laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:01]** Alright, so I'm going to fire off at the big boy at the end of the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:06]** Using your frost zero pistol thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** Correct.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** Nice.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Correct.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** You know, I keep that thing on me, that laser.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Stay frosty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:18]** That is a 19.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:22]** And I got to roll a mischance, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** So if I hit above 20, I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** 45.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** 45.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** That is a hit.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** That's what it takes.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** And which one are you targeting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** The tough-looking red brute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** The big burly one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Yes.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** Fake person?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** Max damage for eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** All right.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** So you draw your pistol, and you kind of focus through that steam.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:02]** And it hits him in the chest and you see him collapse.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Dang.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** He is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** Yes.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:10]** And I'm going to go kind of just around.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:14]** I'm going to get a little bit of cover from this other person.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** That's going to be my whole movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** I thought you were already.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Oh, you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** If that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Okay.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** All right.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** So, and you don't have full coverage from you're talking about, I just moved one step basically.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Yeah.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:33]** So you would still have eyesight with the hallway in the hallway.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Okay.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Just clarifying that.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** That was a great round.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Yeah.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** I'd say, I'd say that's at least, at least 50%.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Yeah.

**[00:48:43 - 00:49:02]** 50 cool because it's now that true warrior's turn and he just watched his friend go down and he's like oh son of a and so he's gonna he goes they actually just started working together he doesn't even know he's just like oh man first day on the job that's tough you should just pack up and go home bud


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Yeah.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** It's not worth it.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** It's not worth your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** It's not worth it at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:11]** Not worth slaving away for these, what do you call them?

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** True warriors?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** True something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** Yeah, just letting you know, we did ice the last group that was under your boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** They don't call us the junk lords for nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Ask around.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:26]** I mean, realistically, they probably captured all the people out there calling us junk lords.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** I think they know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** They probably did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Yeah, god dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** The Chunk Lords are going to get you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** I mean, they were probably like, we're going to make an example of these so-called lords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Going to make an example of these nuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Dude, they're going to praise the hell out of us when we get out.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Chunk Lords 2.0.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Chunk Lords 2.0.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** Roluz redemption.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** There's no redemption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** I'm pretty sure it's too.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Roloo's redemption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:03]** Roloo's going to try to gaslight everyone into thinking that he's good and it's not going to happen.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** Look, the movie was straight to DVD.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** There was no way it was going to be a success.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** It was a lifetime.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** It was a lifetime special.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** You have like Mary-Kate and Ashley cast in it.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Who else is in those?

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Yeah.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** Yeah.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** Um, I, I actually made a mistake and glad I didn't make any movements yet.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:23]** Uh, the true warriors, the true warrior, the tough, true warriors turn.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** They're all true warriors, which makes it tough.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** Um, the big, the big buff one, he's dead.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** It was his turn.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:32]** So Chuck, you actually get to go first and then it's going to be the other guy's turn.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:43]** I think Chalk, because he recognizes her, he wants every bit of that smoke.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** And so he's going to take a shot at Tez Dronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Nice.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** I think I've got a shot here.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Let me see what I can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** And he breathes in, and he breathes out, and he squeezes the trigger.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** What's the...

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** 20%.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:08]** The debuff for shooting beyond the range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** Minus two for every next range.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Okay, cool.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** So you're saying yours is only 30 and you're going to shoot at 35?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** It's 20 and I'm shooting at 35, so yes, it's minus two.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** Oh, okay.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:28]** But that is a 23 minus two is 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** That's a hit.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** Now you have to roll concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Anything over 20%?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** Yep.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:40]** 73.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** I'm good.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:52]** So with that, you hear the tiny asphalt engine in his blaster go.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** What can I never find a D4 for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** You never have a D4 when you need one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Yep.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** It's like a Lego.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** You just don't want to step on it.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** That's a three.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Three blast damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** It's a three.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** Can she even see us?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Because we're super sneaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** Well, she's aware of you now because she just got shot in the back.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** She's aware of one of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** Yeah, she's aware that something shot her in the back.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** She doesn't necessarily know what direction.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** I mean, it came from the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** It could be three foxes in a trench coat.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** That's how the first sniper shot works, right?

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** You don't quite know where it's coming from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** That's true.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** So that's the end of your turn, Chalk?

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Or are you going to move now?

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** You used your move to stay on Rolo.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Got it.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Okay, so now it is this other True Warrior's turn.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** The one that's still kind of backed by the scanner.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** And he is going to take a shot at Terme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** I don't know how I can barely see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Let's see here.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Hold on.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Snap to corner.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** I pick a corner.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Snap that corner.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** I get one, two.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** So you get 50% of cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Plus the 20% through the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:13]** Yeah, so you get a plus 40 racy, and then you'll get a 20% concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Also, you're just beyond his range.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** So he'll get a minus two to that.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** So you got a lot going towards you.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** It's a 15 plus three.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** So 16 to hit.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Does a 16 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Nope.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Well, E-A-C-K-C.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** It actually doesn't matter.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** It doesn't hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Not with a plus four, right?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:40]** Cool.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** So he doesn't even have to deal concealment.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** That is his standard action.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:51]** He is then going to take a step back and out of the sauna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** You guys are like a steam room, you jokers.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** I thought you were from Akaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:05]** So he's going to just move back down into that front airlock area.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** And that's the end of round number two.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** We're now on top of round number three.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** It is the lieutenant's turn.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** What is she going to do?

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** What is she going to do?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** How long does this steam last for?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Four rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Four rounds.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Oh, five.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Wait.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** Duration, concentration.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Okay.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Four.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** So I'm going to roll a perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Yeah, I'm trying to see what the hide does again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** Does a 20 see you?

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Roll me a stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** Another one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Okay.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** I guess because I don't remember which other one it was.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** And this is a stealth after you shot the round, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** Just so you know, well, okay.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:54]** If you are successfully hiding from a creature, that creature is considered flat-footed for the purpose of your first attack from hiding.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Interesting.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:04]** Well, Rolo is hidden, but Chalk is the one that needs to roll the stealth right now because he's the one that took a shot and he didn't roll stealth last time.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** So roll me a stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Nice.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Beautiful.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** So she doesn't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:19]** If you remain invisible after your first attack, that creature is considered flat-footed against your attacks until it succeeds at a perception check to locate you or until you become visible.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Attacking from hiding, page 148.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** So she doesn't see you.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** She feels the shot in her back.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** She turns back.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** All she sees is the steam and darkness.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** And so she's going to take off and move.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** She moves left and out of sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:41]** As she runs away, Chuck yells to Terme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** She's going around the west side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Thanks, buddy.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Good eye, Chuck.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** I mean, we could talk in mind link, though, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** I forgot we had these guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** I'll stay frosty over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** Maybe come circle back.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** I don't know if you want.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** Thaddeus hears that she's gone around the west side.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** His gun's still steaming from the last shot.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:09]** He just turns like 90 degrees to the right and starts walking down there.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** He's going to take up a position ready to hit her.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** 5, 10, 15, 20, 30.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** He's going to move 40 feet right here.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** And he's just going to ready an action to shoot her if she comes around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Check hops on the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** Hey, has Weps hit anything today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Actually, yes.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:28]** Multiple times.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Well, wait.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Not in this exact engagement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Yes, you do recall.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** You were covered in that eye goop from that one creature.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** I did.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** I did kill that last.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** You remember that shot?

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Oh, weps, you're on this channel?

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** I got it.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Oh.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** Oh, I think we're going to break it.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** What?

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** Sorry.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:01]** Wait, guys, just to confirm, though, for real, like, she's coming on the far west, the far west hallway, right?

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** There are two west hallways.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Come on, whoops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:06]** Is it the far one?

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Good.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** I'm going to.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** That's it.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Shock's my next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** Are you just going to take out the whole squad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** That is.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Is that your plan?

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** I'm not.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Shut up.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** All right.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** That is just ready.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** It's just ready to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:29]** All right, just a reminder, a ready to action will move you in initiative order if it happens.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** Whatever.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Yes, it's fine.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:36]** The question is, I can't remember, does it move you if it doesn't happen or it just doesn't happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** If it doesn't happen by the time you get your next turn, you just get your turn when it comes up.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Got it.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** Rolu, you're up.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** What are you doing?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:54]** Rolu carefully studies this steaming wall and starting to sweat underneath his mask and says, Shock, I don't think we're going to get by this anytime soon.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Let's double back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** Hey, there's a door right there.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** We could try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** Perfect.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Perfect.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Thanks for pointing that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:08]** So this door, the door right in front of you is actually, you guys tried it once before and it was damaged to be on repair.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** So the door right next to you is not able to be opened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Shock, you fool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** That was not it.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Shock, you fool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** You fool.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** All right, you fool of a rexalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** All right, so it's going to be...

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** That's 30 feet to get back into the room that we were in.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:34]** And then I'm going to assume another, it's going to be another round of two movements, but that's okay.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:40]** Cause Rulu has shock on his shoulder, like a turret taken sniping people and taking names.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** I mean, Chuck, Chuck, the big bed killer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:58:45 - 00:59:06]** Ralu, swiftly studied movement, moves into the room and is going to cross over to the other side of the room, swiftly stepping out of the way of debris, steps into the hallway and looks left and right, can make out Termay down in the center of the hallway to the left.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** And that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** This is going to be that first true warrior and they're inside of that room.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:18]** Um, they're going to move up and Treme, all you're going to see is the door open.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** Cool.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** And that, that is the end of that true warriors turn.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** So let me dynamic lighting.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** That door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** Is the door like open or is it just like a slide?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** It's open or, oh, I guess it would slide.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** So he pushes the button and it goes and slides open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** So Star Trek doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Yeah.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** You can see they're like double paneled if you look at the art.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Okay.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** So that is the end of his turn.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Torme, you're up.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:44]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** Can I do a quick perception check to see what happened to that Frag Mark 2 grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Oh.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** Did anybody look up the rules about whether or not disarming something?

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** Spoiler.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** No, I did not.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:59]** I've got a handwritten note here that says, yes, it survives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** It's written in Raxalite, so yeah, true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Kevin is not pleased.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** He's not laughing.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** I mean, you can roll to see if it's still there is what you're asking, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Luck roll.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Is there a modifier for that?

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Or just take it straight?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Are you feeling lucky?

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Are you?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Punk?

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]** Perception... I got a 16.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:39]** I think that's enough to see a grenade underneath one of the two dead Yosokis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** Dope.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** Um...

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:50]** I guess I can't like pick it up and I can't move, pick it up and then use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Not in the same round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]** So I'm just going to take a mental note of that.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Yeah.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** I'm going to, I'm going to move 20 feet towards the door.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:08]** I'm going to do it inch by inch until I see hopefully one of these, the poor soul who opened the door.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** I don't see.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:14]** And I, I'm just going to, I guess I'm just going to toss it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:15]** What are you tossing in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Short game.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:25]** I'm going to toss in a... Let's go with a sticky bomb grenade.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** Mark one.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** Nice.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:28]** All right.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** So I got a 17 to throw.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** So I'm guessing that hits it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** So I forget how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** You have to roll to hit a square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:41 - 01:02:10]** so range attacks of the thrown weapon with a thrown weapon or a grenade you can make a ranged attack at a target within a weapon's maximum range so whatever the maximum range is 20. you add your strength modifier to the range attack rolls with a thrown weapon and today it doesn't tell you where to oh targeting a grid section it's the next section next line so using that weapon you treat a range attack against ac of five so the range is what on a sticky bomb 20. they're all 20.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:20]** Okay, so you could throw it up to 20 feet, and then you could throw it further and just add a plus two to the DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Yeah, I see.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:24]** So I'm actually going to throw it right in to 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:30]** Just do a little hook it in, right?

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:35]** Because I don't see the guy, but I'm assuming he's right near the door because he had to open it.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** And I hit that.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** By the way, I hit a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** when I roll.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Okay.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:42]** And is there a reflex save to that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** So there's a couple.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:52]** There's the the explode which the damage is I think just just the entangled.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** Yeah.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:57]** So there's a there's a there's listed here there's

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:05]** an Explode DC of 11, an Entangle Acrobatics DC of 12, and a Break DC of 17.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** So if they get Entangled, they have to hit a DC 17.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** So, yeah.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Yeah.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:35]** a creature hit by an entangled weapon becomes entangled until it escapes with an acrobatics check dc 10 plus the items level plus the attacker's dexterity modifier which for me puts it at 11 or a strength check dc 15 plus weapons item level so that'd be 16 plus the attacker's dexterity

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** Why is it always the smaller one, I wonder?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:42]** An entangled creature can attempt such a check as a move action.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:49]** Some weapons have a maximum duration for this effect, so the duration is 2d4 rounds if he becomes entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Okay, so what's the DC do I have to roll?

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** I'm rolling reflex save.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** I got a 19.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:00]** So that halves or... That's what I don't get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:06]** I think it's similar to the days... So it'd be half the entangled rounds?

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Right.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** So roll the rounds.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** So it's 2d4.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:10]** Okay.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:13]** So that's three then.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** I rolled six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Okay.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** So three rounds.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** So he's entangled now for three rounds.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Yep.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Cool.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** And that's the end of your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** Yeah, because I moved up.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:23]** Wow.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:24]** Nicely done.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** Got him where it hurts.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:26]** Yeah.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** Chip shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** The person I can't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:37]** I hope they're... Take a minus two to my AC, my attack rolls, my saving throws, initiative checks, and dexterity-based skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** I think you can move half speed too, right?

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Welcome to Entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:43]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Welcome to Entangled.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** We got all the sticky stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** Fun again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** You move at half speed.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** Okay.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:52]** Yeah.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** We've got whips and chains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Oh.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:56]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Yeah.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** There it is.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:01]** So my speed is halved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:05]** We're like a band, but better because we play TTRPG.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** I don't know where that was going.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** TTRPG band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** We're a band of TTRPG players.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:11]** That's your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** Yes, I used my move action to stay on Rulu's shoulder.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:24]** And I'm going to ready a firing action if I see Tez Tronin.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:28]** Because I don't actually know that that other true warrior is in play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** That is the end of your turn.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** It is now this other human true warriors turn.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:42]** He's going to step back up against that wall and see if I got vision on you.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:45]** Treme snapped a corner.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** I do.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:49]** So I, you're going to be in kind of that same situation.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:52]** I, I just showed, can you not see Matt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:56]** Well, I just see black from that entire square.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** I don't even see a single corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Oh, you're right.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** So I'll have to see if I can see you first.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:03]** So I got 13 on perception.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** So it probably does not see you.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** Okay, so that's going to be his turn.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** Moving to the top of round number three.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** This damn steam is really kicking my ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** It's a real cat and mouse game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:18]** You mean Termay and Whaler kicking your ass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** Go.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** Yeah, just the two of them.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:24]** Nobody else has done anything in this whole game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** Yeah, definitely not.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** For sure.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:29]** I could use some help down here, though.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:32]** I'm a little weary of what's coming next.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** This thing's not going to last much longer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Stay put.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** We're literally down the hall from you.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Can you see us?

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:37]** I'm waving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Yeah, I can see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Okay.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** All right.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** Good.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Hang in there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** I got to cover your six, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** Yeah, you're very good at that.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** I would not trust Thaddeus.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:49]** I mean, I trust Thaddeus, but more than you, Rolu.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Yeah, Rolu.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:50]** I'm just, you know.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** Rolu, you lost the game.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:58]** Thaddeus, you do have a tendency to just sit in the back.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:02]** You know, he might just run away and you never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:05]** I feel like Thaddeus is always on the six, if you know what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:13]** So you guys can't see the movement of this, but the lieutenant actually comes back around and to that door.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:22]** She heard that grenade go off, and she comes back to the door on the bottom leading into the room where the other terroir is, and she's going to say, just hang in there.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** We got this.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** No, you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Turn back now.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:27]** Run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:30]** Kev, roll a deception check, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:32]** Roll a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** For what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:36]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** I know it's your first day, but it's okay.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** You got this.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** You'll learn on the job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:44]** That's what they always tell you right before they throw you into the cannon fodder.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:47]** You get sticky-grenaded to the ground.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Yeah, that was a warning, pal.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** I got more grenades than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** All right, Thaddeus, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** What are you doing?

**[01:07:52 - 01:08:01]** Thaddeus first is just imagining Shaq pressed into a book, you know, when you just press a flower down flat so you can preserve it.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:06]** He's thinking of Shaq as a bookmark because of these recent comments, and then he's just imagining Tremé.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:10]** It's just an empty shell of helmets and stuff and robes just hanging on his wall.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:16]** He's grumbling to himself at these borderline insubordinate comments.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:22]** He hasn't seen the other true warrior come around the corner, but he's going to line up.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:26]** He's going to come around the corner and ready an action to see if she pops around and he'll fire off.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:30]** He's now at the northwest corner of that hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:33]** All right, so you're staying on that hallway.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** You have an action to shoot if she comes around.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:41]** Rolo's standing there just outside the door to the north of that supply room, and he's got Chuck on his shoulder.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** Head?

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Shoulders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** Knees?

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:44]** Toes?

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:44]** Toes?

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:47]** Yeah, Chuck's on his toes like a toddler.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** He's just, like, holding leaves.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:53]** And, like, when Rolo moves, Chuck, like, moves his feet.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:59]** I, John, am trying to make a decision about something that I want to say to Shock right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** Roll a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:01]** Okay.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** No doubt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** You do what you need to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]** I love that I've started a trade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** Well, I'll say this.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** You should trust me.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** I got to put high wisdom on everything, all my characters now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:16]** Like I said, I have a minus one of my wisdom, and I rolled a five.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:19]** So, you know.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** I think I'm going to say it.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** So as he is stepping on the hall, Thaddeus, we're coming your way.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:30]** And then turns off the mind link or just opts out of the mind link for a second.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** I don't know if it works that way, but sure.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:33]** I'll give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** He clicks the unsubscribe button at the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:39]** Or I say it out loud, whatever it is.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]** It says, turn away, we're on our way.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:46]** And then starts walking five feet at a time, slowly walking.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:54]** looking out for anybody that's coming around the corner and as he's walking he says Sean can I tell you something I think you're gonna tell me anyway

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** How did you know that?

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** That's my job.

**[01:09:56 - 01:10:00]** Chuck, I know something about my future.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** And it's not good.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:10]** But the people that sponsored me, the Vale... F***.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:13]** They... F*** is that?

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** They're good people.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** They know how to save me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:22]** And they're the ones that have asked for the stone.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:34]** And then right at that moment, we get to the corner, and Rulu looks around the corner, sees the dead bodies, and we're up close to Torme, turns on the comms, opts back into the mind link.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:37]** Torme, nicely done here with this wall of steam.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]** I'm assuming that is your work, of course.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:42]** Crosses the hall to stand next to Torme.

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:50]** I think that was more than 30 feet, which would be unfortunate because I kind of wanted to heal a Treme with a spell, but it is 55 feet.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** So I cannot do that quite yet.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:54]** And I don't have anything.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:55]** And that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** Okay.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Can I just make a comment?

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:03]** I don't know where Rolu is thinking or why Rolu is thinking this is going to help make anyone, like, care.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:06]** Like, it's just, like, it's, like, just to save your own ass.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:10]** It just sounds like you're just trying to betray everyone to save your own ass, Rolu.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:11]** Maybe.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Not you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:16]** Can I roll a culture check to see if I know who the Vale is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** Uh, sure.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** Can I Google the Vale?

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** No.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** I've never heard of it before.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:25]** It's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]** Chuck knows all about the veil.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:30]** I'm assuming.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** So it's a 19 on the die plus eight.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:40]** And I have a minus five to the DC related to knowledge of commercial organizations or businesses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:46]** Not quite commercial or into the ship business, but I think you still rolled high.

**[01:11:46 - 01:12:09]** You rolled high enough to know that Nakraw, who is the Barathu super entity that has this algorithmic clairvoyance, let's call it, about what will happen and has successfully predicted things happening, major things, that there is a group called the Veil of the Seer that our collection of individuals should be.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:14]** Help look out for and act on behalf of a croc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** Okay.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** Not in the core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:17]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:23]** If I might take a half step back, with that culture check, do I know why the Vale might want this puck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:37]** You would know from that culture check that the Veil of the Seer is the PR, or can operate as the PR or social outlet of Nacral, issuing and being the communique for events or things that might happen.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:42]** Do they get... They don't send out email blasts all the time, right?

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:52]** But you know that if there's anybody that they're working with, any groups like the Starfinders, the Wayfinders, the Xeno Wardens, they often might intercede, step in...

**[01:12:52 - 01:13:11]** ask for acquisition of some sort of object or to be a part of some sort of expedition assuming that it is part of some future event they don't always feel like they have to explain themselves but often times they usually will because it's pretty clear what they're there for

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:16]** Does Rolu know how much the puck and what that means?

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** You would have to ask.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:24]** But in general, it's kind of a 50-50 of, you know, they might, like, they probably have good intentions.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** Nothing, like, nefarious happens, per se.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:33]** It's just they tend to be the, I think, as I said, McCraw is the Nostradamus of the pack world in a way.

**[01:13:33 - 01:14:00]** so and finally i want to roll a sense motive to see like how fearful rolu is for this future coming to pass ah it's a 15 15 would tell you that this was a heavy thing to get off his chest the way that he said it the way that it seemed uh he was being truthful in how fearful he is of something coming to pass in the future


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:04]** But to be clear, it's fearful about something that's going to happen to Rulu, right?

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** Not some larger event?

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:06]** Or is it both?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:07]** Right.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:15]** You kind of got the sense that it's going to happen to Rulu, but Rulu was trying to share it in a moment of vulnerability of, I am worried about this.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:22]** These people that sponsor me are doing good on my behalf.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:26]** They're helping me avoid something that is going to happen to me.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:36]** And I'm trying to share that in goodwill to convince, you know, Chuck to lay it all out there, which we can keep in summary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:37]** Sorry.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** Uh, shock.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:41]** Hey, like I really needed this to stay alive.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:46]** So I put all of us in danger, like to like, you know, get it just, you know, just saying cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:50]** Wow, it really sounds like Thaddeus is talking in on a conversation that he is.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:52]** No, this is purely out of character.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:56]** Adding some editorial there that really feels like it.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:58]** You weren't really there in the moment, so it's tough to say.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** You're playing beautifully, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:03]** I'm just commenting on Roli, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** Oh, okay.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** Ask Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** All right, so it's the true warrior's turn.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:11]** He's inside of that dining area, the dining hall.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:15]** He's covered in just sticky goop, like glue.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:18]** You didn't expect that, did you?

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:19]** Yeah.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]** You probably didn't expect this either.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:25]** And he steps over in line of sight with Jermay.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:29]** And he shoots him with his pulse caster pistol.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:30]** Can you even see me?

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:32]** This time, yep, I can see you.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** I checked.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:33]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:36]** Where is he?

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** He moved over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:41]** Oh, that's the guy.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:43]** That's the guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** I've been checking every time.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:48]** And this time you're within range, so I don't have to use that extra minus two.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:49]** But it's a terrible miss.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:50]** Well, two on a die.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:51]** That definitely doesn't hit you.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:53]** So he just steps over, takes a shot.

**[01:15:53 - 01:16:01]** I feel like the Pulsecaster shoots like a blue circle, similar to a great TV show.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** And that's the end of that character's turn.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** Treme, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** What are you doing?

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:08]** Oh, you meant to probably do something like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:16]** I'm just going to shoot him.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** I'm just going to try for it.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:21]** Natural 20.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:22]** That's it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:24]** That's the one.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:25]** Yeah.

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:26]** That's the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:28]** On the frostbite.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** Class 0.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:29]** Yeah.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:33]** So the... That's a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:33]** Pull the crit cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:42]** Well, I think it has a crit special property that I think I will just keep with that because I think I learned my lesson last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:43]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** Yeah, he did get screwed.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** Once bitten, twice shy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** Yeah.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** Wait, what's the phrase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]** Once bitten, twice shy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:51]** It's got a staggered effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** Yeah.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:56]** So you have to do a fort saved to be staggered.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:59]** Otherwise, you're staggered.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** DC is 13.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:02]** But I still can do double damage, right?

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:05]** Yep.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:07]** Get my D6 out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:08]** Wow.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:08]** Okay.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:09]** Get D6 out.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:13]** That's a 13 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:16]** So I pass the... Yeah, Tycho's the runner.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:24]** So the first swath of... Oh, I only rolled one decent.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:24]** I rolled a two.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]** So it's 12 points of damage.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** That's total?

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]** Total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:31]** All right.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:33]** That's your whole turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** Or you can still move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:36]** Well, I haven't moved.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:39]** Thaddeus, are you down there?

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:41]** We could use your help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:45]** I'm going to move up to kind of surround this door.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:52]** So I'm going to move, and I'm going to be kind of looking in it to see if there's anyone else in there.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:55]** Oh, I spotted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:56]** You're strafing across the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:56 - 01:18:03]** Yeah, so I crossed the threshold, and when I get about here, I think I see Tez Tronin.

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:03]** So I call that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:09]** I say, Tez Tronin, you should turn back now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:14]** And you actually hear the true warrior that just took a shot at you laugh almost hysterically.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:18]** No, that ain't Tez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:23]** Oh, well, I don't know who it was, but you should turn back now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:27]** His laughter is almost hysterical, but also like fearful.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:29]** That was not Tez.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** Come out and play then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:33]** Chuck, what are you doing?

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:34]** Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:38]** I'm going to turn to Rolu and flip my comms off and whisper in his ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:41]** Ralu, I appreciate you sharing.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:43]** We'll have to dive into this later.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:45]** Maybe even we're not getting shot at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:56]** And he uses another move action to hop down and go to the corner right next to the door where that true warrior is entangled in the room.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:57]** That's all I got.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** That's two move actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:59 - 01:18:59]** All right.

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:02]** It is now this other true warrior's turn.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:04]** Let me just check one thing.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** He can't move.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:07]** He's still stuck on the other side of that steam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:08]** That's for one more.

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:13]** As soon as I hit my turn again, that's when it should dissipate, I would guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:16]** He does have a shot at Rolu.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:18]** It's a very slim one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:19]** But does he take it, though?

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:22]** He's going to try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:29]** He's probably not going to take it.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** He's going to try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:31]** Going to try.

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:32]** Try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:34]** 11 to hit.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** EAC.

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:39]** I'd like to solve the puzzle.

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:42]** Does 11 hit your EAC roller?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:45]** Go ahead and solve the puzzle for me, Will.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:46]** That doesn't hit.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:47]** That is ding, ding, ding.

**[01:19:47 - 01:19:48]** That is correct.

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:49]** Survey says it doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:51]** And that's the end of his turn then.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:53]** Actually, no, he's going to take one step to the side.

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:56]** This guy's got just like stuck here.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** Top of round number four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:59]** Love this spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:02]** You only have seven true warriors left in this room.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:04]** Oh, only seven.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:05]** Only seven.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** Only seven?

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:07]** If I'm keeping count properly.

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:09]** You know, I'm terrible at counting, though.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:14]** No, we have there, and your characters don't know this.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:16]** But it's more for the listener.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:18]** There are three true warriors left.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:22]** There are two male true warriors, one outside the steam.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:24]** There's one stuck in the sticky bomb in that room.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:32]** And then we have the female lieutenant, who's not Tez Tronin that we learned, standing outside the door to the south of that room.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** It is her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:40]** Yeah, don't forget that Tez Tronin looks like Sephiroth, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:44]** So the lieutenant is going to march into the room and take a shot at Chak.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:44]** Ooh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:46]** Ooh!

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:47]** Yeah!

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** Wait, no, that's not good.

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:50]** Yeah, no, why?

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:51]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:53]** Through a true warrior in a rabbit corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** I'm a traitor now, Thanos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:56]** You're right.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:59]** So you'll get plus two soft cover.

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:00]** Wait, let me move a little further.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:01]** Let me see what works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** I think you'd get more in soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:06]** You don't stack covers, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:06 - 01:21:07]** No, I'd probably get...

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:10]** Half cover from the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:11]** So you get half cover from the wall.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:11]** So it's a plus four.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:14]** I think it's plus four either way because half cover is also plus four.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:14]** So, okay.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:17]** You get a plus four to that.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:19]** That's a 16 to hit.

**[01:21:20 - 01:21:22]** I'm sure that doesn't hit then, does it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:23]** Survey says top five answers on the board.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:25]** Number one answer is no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** That's a miss.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:29]** So she steps up, takes a shot.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:30]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:31]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:35]** Thaddeus has his gun like pointed forward and like a SWAT, like he's on a SWAT team.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:40]** He's just kind of like wrapping around the corner here, expecting that he's going to find that lieutenant.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:45]** So this hallway, there's a turn in the hallway where it goes eastbound again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:47]** Eastbound and down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:48]** Towards where Terme, in fact, is.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:52]** So Thaddeus turns the corner, and he sees Terme, and he gives him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:52]** Oh, hey.

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:53]** Nice of you to join us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:53 - 01:21:54]** Oh, hey, Thaddeus.

**[01:21:54 - 01:21:55]** He also sees Shaq and Rolu.

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:57]** Well, the gang's reunited there.

**[01:21:58 - 01:22:02]** We were all waiting on you, dude.

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:03]** I'm going to get Shaq.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:09]** I can't wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:12]** There's no kill shots available yet.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:13]** I thought you were coming in early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:17]** Some leader you are, threatening.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:19]** Thaddeus is going to stay in this hallway.

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:24]** He's going to keep his gun trained south because everyone is covering the other direction.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:25]** He's covering east.

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:31]** And he's just going to see if anyone crawls up around the far south side of the map up into the hall.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:40]** And so translation in terms of like mechanics, he's keeping his ready to action ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:40]** Ready to action ready.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:41]** All right.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:43]** That was a great turn from Thaddeus.

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:45]** Rolu, what are you doing?


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:45]** Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:47 - 01:23:02]** turns back on his comms, if he hadn't already, just to make sure, and then is going to stand right near Shock and see the true warrior in that room and is going to... Can I be in the same square as you, Shock?

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:03]** Yes.

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:05]** Yeah, I can't because you've been on my shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:06]** Duh.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:09]** Yeah, you can be in the same square as somebody one size up or down, I believe.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:09]** Got it.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:12]** That was...

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:17]** Okay, so I'm going to pass by the door so I can see if there's anybody else.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:20]** I step in front of the door and I don't see anybody.

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]** And you know what?

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:22]** Brolu's going to go in.

**[01:23:22 - 01:23:23]** He's going to step in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:27]** And as he steps in the room... Sticky bomb doesn't linger, right?

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:28]** So it just explodes and that's it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:28 - 01:23:29]** Yeah.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:30]** I think it's an area of effect.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:33]** Not that I read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:38]** So, Rolo, as you step into that room, you do feel like it's a little sticky on the ground, but it doesn't affect you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:38]** Okay.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:47]** And also, I, the player, and I imagine now I, Rolo, as I'm sitting outside the door, I couldn't see this other true warrior deeper in the room.

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:49]** I didn't see it.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:52]** And as I stepped in, as I moved my token in, I saw them.

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:54]** I was like, all right, well, I've already...

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:57]** Already moved that chest piece, so Rolus steps right inside the door.

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:14]** He is 15 feet away from that first true warrior, and two of his hands are going to spread wide as the tips of his fingers, the air around it starts to shimmer as if there's all this heat, and he's going to cast overheat on that first true warrior.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:21]** They need to make a DC 14 reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:22 - 01:24:24]** That's a 15 on this attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:24 - 01:24:26]** Well, isn't that convenient?

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:32]** That is going to be half of, come on, really high five damage.

**[01:24:33 - 01:24:38]** So two points of heat damage on this true warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:52]** So you pull all the energy from that room, everything from chalks, leaves, just kind of reverse photosynthesis from the true warriors, just all this absorption, and then it blows out into a pillar of steam.

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:58]** And then as the fire fades away, you just see a burning carcass on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:00]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:02]** That true warrior is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:02]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[01:25:03 - 01:25:03]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:06]** All right.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:07]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:07 - 01:25:09]** Is there anyone else in that room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:10 - 01:25:12]** There's someone at the end of the room.

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:14]** Their lieutenant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:16]** Who hasn't taken the hint.

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:18]** There's not Tez Tronin in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** Not Tez Tronin.

**[01:25:19 - 01:25:22]** Rolo probably should have remembered her asset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** Slash Johnny.

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:24]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:25]** Torme, you're up.

**[01:25:25 - 01:25:25]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:26 - 01:25:32]** So, knowing that the steam has now begun to lift... Oh, so is the steam gone officially?

**[01:25:33 - 01:25:34]** Yes, at the start.

**[01:25:34 - 01:25:35]** I would assume at the start of my turn.

**[01:25:35 - 01:25:37]** I think it's at the end of your turn.

**[01:25:37 - 01:25:38]** Oh, the end of my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:41]** It'll take me your whole turn to highlight it and delete it, so we're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:41 - 01:25:42]** Whatever.

**[01:25:43 - 01:25:46]** I'm going to go up to the...

**[01:25:46 - 01:25:57]** you know up to 30 feet i mean i'm gonna say hey peekaboo and i'm gonna toss a grenade so it's five feet it raises the dc or it's at 10 feet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:02]** Every 20 feet, it would raise the DC by two.

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:07]** It decreases your attack bonus by two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:07 - 01:26:08]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:08]** I'm pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:09]** There it is.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:10]** Okay.

**[01:26:10 - 01:26:13]** Oh, it's just like a regular range.

**[01:26:13 - 01:26:14]** Got it.

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:22]** So if I do this, then that means my... Okay, so it would be plus one instead of plus three on my range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:22 - 01:26:23]** Because they are 40 feet out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:24]** Yeah.

**[01:26:25 - 01:26:25]** Right?

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:28]** I don't know.

**[01:26:28 - 01:26:28]** It's 30 or 20.

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:30]** I hate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:31 - 01:26:40]** I guess if you're aiming at the corner close, because you pick a corner, if you're aiming at the first corner of his square, then yeah, that would be right at 40 feet.

**[01:26:40 - 01:26:41]** So it's only minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:42]** Got it.

**[01:26:43 - 01:26:43]** All right.

**[01:26:43 - 01:26:45]** So hitting the corner.

**[01:26:46 - 01:26:49]** That is a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:49 - 01:26:50]** That strikes the corner.

**[01:26:50 - 01:26:53]** What is the grenade and what is the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:54 - 01:27:00]** I'm throwing the frag grenade mark two that I have on my person.

**[01:27:00 - 01:27:05]** I have one in the hallway that I'm going to pick up after this turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:06]** Nice.

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:06]** Perhaps.

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:07]** I rolled a 13.

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:08]** What is the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:08 - 01:27:09]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:09 - 01:27:10]** Oh, so it meets.

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:11]** So I get half.

**[01:27:11 - 01:27:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:12]** Nice.

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:14]** So you get five points.

**[01:27:14 - 01:27:15]** I rolled 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:16]** Five points of damage.

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:17]** Okay.

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:18]** Boom.

**[01:27:18 - 01:27:19]** Boom.

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:30]** This poor guy, he's been stuck on the other side of the steam wall, and that steam dissipates right as Treme steps out and throws a grenade at him, and then it explodes on him.

**[01:27:30 - 01:27:31]** And he takes five points of damage.

**[01:27:32 - 01:27:33]** It is now the top of round number five.

**[01:27:34 - 01:27:37]** It is the true warrior lieutenant's turn.

**[01:27:37 - 01:27:43]** Now that you're closer and you see her, you can tell she's not who you saw in the car yards.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:48]** She's going to take a double shot at Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:49]** Ooh.

**[01:27:49 - 01:27:50]** Double shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:52 - 01:27:55]** That's a 12 to hit the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:55 - 01:27:56]** Survey says no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:00 - 01:28:01]** Hey, how are we on time?

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:04]** Are we just going to... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:04 - 01:28:05]** That's fine.

**[01:28:05 - 01:28:07]** That's a 15 to hit this time.

**[01:28:07 - 01:28:08]** KAC.

**[01:28:08 - 01:28:09]** KAC.

**[01:28:09 - 01:28:09]** That hits.

**[01:28:10 - 01:28:11]** That's a hit.

**[01:28:11 - 01:28:12]** Dang.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:12]** Almost.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:12]** Maybe.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:15]** Let me just double check concealment.

**[01:28:15 - 01:28:16]** That's a 30 on the die.

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:16]** It's good.

**[01:28:17 - 01:28:17]** Cool.

**[01:28:17 - 01:28:18]** So you're going to take...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:28:20 - 01:28:39]** one point of damage no seven points of damage wow that's a little much can i yeah can i take two instead second can i take two points of damage instead no okay all right just asking for a friend do you want do you want an extra five for asking

**[01:28:39 - 01:28:40]** Wow.

**[01:28:40 - 01:28:40]** Okay.

**[01:28:40 - 01:28:42]** That's super unnecessary of you.

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:44]** Yeah, that's not needed.

**[01:28:44 - 01:28:44]** All right.

**[01:28:44 - 01:28:45]** Yeah.

**[01:28:45 - 01:28:46]** Come on, Kev.


## Speaker_0

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:47]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:47]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[01:28:47 - 01:28:48]** What are you doing?

**[01:28:48 - 01:28:49]** 50 episodes and he's still a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:51 - 01:28:52]** Thaddeus, I think.

**[01:28:52 - 01:28:53]** Yeah, I know, right?

**[01:28:53 - 01:28:56]** Thaddeus, I think, can hear the action going on in that room.

**[01:28:57 - 01:28:59]** So he's going to start walking towards it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:59 - 01:29:00]** So he stays out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:00 - 01:29:11]** so he starts walking towards it uh sauntering direction being like yeah his little tail whooshing around um

**[01:29:12 - 01:29:17]** Being that he's slow as F because of his heavy armor, he can just make it.

**[01:29:17 - 01:29:19]** Are these doors open?

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:21]** Can they stay open or do they have to either?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:21 - 01:29:22]** They're open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:22 - 01:29:22]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:22 - 01:29:24]** You can close it if you want, but that's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:24 - 01:29:29]** No, he's going to camp on the other side because I think he can fire through the door.

**[01:29:29 - 01:29:33]** He now sees the true warrior lieutenant and he's just...

**[01:29:33 - 01:29:37]** On the end of the door, going to get ready to shoot her next time around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:37 - 01:29:38]** Oh, is that a double move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:38 - 01:29:38]** Yeah.

**[01:29:38 - 01:29:42]** I move doubly, and then I'm just, yeah, I'm just ready to attack next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:43 - 01:29:43]** Okay.

**[01:29:43 - 01:29:53]** I think you, like, I sort of imagine Thaddeus' frustrated breath just falling on Chak, and you see the fibers on the back of his neck start to stand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:54 - 01:29:55]** Oh, that's right.

**[01:29:55 - 01:29:56]** Chak is right here.

**[01:29:56 - 01:29:58]** I didn't even realize I stood, like, right on top of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:58 - 01:29:58]** That's so good.


## Speaker_0

**[01:29:58 - 01:29:59]** You did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:01 - 01:30:01]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:01 - 01:30:02]** Rolu, what are you doing?

**[01:30:02 - 01:30:09]** Rolu just levels his gun and just takes a shot.

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:10]** That's it.

**[01:30:12 - 01:30:17]** Super strong 13 against KAC.

**[01:30:18 - 01:30:19]** Sorry, EAC.

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:23]** EAC with an azimuth serpent laser shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:23 - 01:30:26]** That matches, so it's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:26 - 01:30:27]** Nice.

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:28]** Matches, so it's a hit.

**[01:30:28 - 01:30:30]** Let's get this hit going.

**[01:30:31 - 01:30:37]** As I drop my D4 onto the ground, that is a super strong five points of fire damage.

**[01:30:38 - 01:30:38]** Wow.

**[01:30:39 - 01:30:40]** Nine points of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:40 - 01:30:41]** Oh, nine points.

**[01:30:41 - 01:30:42]** That changes everything.

**[01:30:42 - 01:30:43]** Yeah.

**[01:30:44 - 01:30:44]** So...

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:46]** She takes two shots at you.

**[01:30:46 - 01:30:47]** Thaddeus moves over.

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:49]** You take a shot at her.

**[01:30:49 - 01:30:51]** This hits her right in the shoulder.

**[01:30:51 - 01:30:55]** And as she's falling to the ground, you just hear her shout, fall back.

**[01:30:55 - 01:30:57]** And then she hits the ground.

**[01:30:57 - 01:30:58]** There are more.

**[01:30:58 - 01:31:01]** Bleeds out slowly.

**[01:31:01 - 01:31:03]** And she's now dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:06]** That was all right.

**[01:31:07 - 01:31:08]** Nice job, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:10 - 01:31:14]** Is there more people behind this door that we saw?

**[01:31:15 - 01:31:15]** Which door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:16 - 01:31:17]** I don't see anybody else in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:19 - 01:31:22]** The scanner.

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:25]** There's nobody that you can see beyond that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:25 - 01:31:26]** Okay.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:28]** So there's just this lone dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:29 - 01:31:31]** He's the only one by that door.

**[01:31:32 - 01:31:35]** You're talking about the very entrance door, where the scanner is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:37]** Yeah, the only guy I can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:37 - 01:31:39]** There's only one standing body there currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:39 - 01:31:40]** I'm just going to shoot then.

**[01:31:42 - 01:31:43]** Do you know how to catch bullets?

**[01:31:44 - 01:31:45]** You ever see that magic trick?

**[01:31:46 - 01:31:49]** And he levels this frostbite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:50 - 01:31:51]** You talk about Penn and Teller?

**[01:31:51 - 01:31:52]** Yeah, I love that show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:52 - 01:31:54]** Yeah, Penn and Teller, great show in Vegas.

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:55]** See if you can catch up with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:57 - 01:32:01]** And he's like, right before he shoots, he's like, but that's, you know, that's a trick, right?

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:03]** Yeah, 19.

**[01:32:03 - 01:32:03]** Boom.

**[01:32:05 - 01:32:05]** That definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:32:06 - 01:32:06]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:09]** Didn't that trick go wrong one time?

**[01:32:09 - 01:32:11]** And that's seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:12 - 01:32:12]** Ouch.

**[01:32:13 - 01:32:13]** Woo.

**[01:32:14 - 01:32:15]** Chak, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:16]** Was that your full turn?

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:16]** I'm going to move out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:32:17 - 01:32:18]** So you can't see me now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:19 - 01:32:21]** All right, Chak, what are you doing?

**[01:32:21 - 01:32:26]** You are standing underneath Thaddeus on the opposite side of the hallway that Torme just passed over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:26 - 01:32:27]** I am.

**[01:32:28 - 01:32:30]** So I see this room is clear.

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:34]** And I heard Thaddeus shooting at something and mumbling about catching bullets.

**[01:32:34 - 01:32:45]** So Chak is going to run over to the hallway and yell to the true warrior, Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:32:45 - 01:32:46]** Catch these bullets!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:47 - 01:32:50]** That is a 9 plus 5, 14.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:53]** Nope, nope, nope.

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:54]** That's a 10.

**[01:32:54 - 01:32:55]** That's a 10 hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:55 - 01:32:58]** That's a 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:58 - 01:32:58]** EAC?

**[01:32:58 - 01:32:58]** 10 EAC.


## Speaker_0

**[01:32:58 - 01:32:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:59 - 01:33:00]** That meets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:02 - 01:33:02]** Dope.

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:04]** Get him.

**[01:33:04 - 01:33:05]** Big bad killer.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:06]** Here we go.

**[01:33:06 - 01:33:07]** This is the big bad.

**[01:33:07 - 01:33:09]** This one, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:09 - 01:33:11]** That's three blast damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:12 - 01:33:12]** Boom.

**[01:33:13 - 01:33:14]** All right.

**[01:33:14 - 01:33:21]** You hit him hard, and you can see he's real hurt, and he just heard the lieutenant shout, fall back.

**[01:33:21 - 01:33:27]** And he looks at you, and he puts his gun down, and he just turns around and runs out the door.

**[01:33:29 - 01:33:32]** And he keeps running, and he keeps running.

**[01:33:32 - 01:33:34]** I don't know if you guys can see this on your map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:34 - 01:33:35]** No, I can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:43]** As soon as he gets out and he emerges into the harsh sunlight, he's caught around the neck by a large gray hand.

**[01:33:44 - 01:33:51]** He's picked up into the air and lifted until his eye to glowing yellow eye with, let me show you this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:52 - 01:33:56]** Somebody upset that they failed.

**[01:33:57 - 01:33:58]** That he ran away.

**[01:33:58 - 01:34:00]** This was his first day too, right?

**[01:34:00 - 01:34:03]** I mean, it's not a great first day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:03 - 01:34:05]** Dude, honestly, don't join the True Warriors.

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:05]** Dude, don't.

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:06]** Do anything else.

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:08]** Yeah, they sound like losers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:09 - 01:34:09]** They suck.

**[01:34:10 - 01:34:17]** They weren't voted, you know, CupHack Depot's best employers of, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:17 - 01:34:19]** Go ahead, describe him to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:19 - 01:34:23]** Okay, so holy shit, he kind of looks like Ghost Rider.

**[01:34:23 - 01:34:25]** This looks like him.

**[01:34:25 - 01:34:31]** Flame dash goes and a crossbow with, like, some green glowing, like, wire on it.

**[01:34:31 - 01:34:33]** And I don't know what race this is.

**[01:34:33 - 01:34:35]** It almost looks like an android, but he's not, right?

**[01:34:35 - 01:34:36]** Four arms.

**[01:34:36 - 01:34:38]** Biological, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:38 - 01:34:42]** And just to be clear, I'm pretty sure flame dash goes are two-handed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:42 - 01:34:44]** And unwieldy, yeah.

**[01:34:44 - 01:34:45]** Maybe he's that big and strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:45 - 01:34:48]** Yeah, I think he is because he has a large yellow eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:49 - 01:34:54]** He reminds me of Goron from Mortal Kombat, but with plate armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:54 - 01:35:01]** Actually, the armor looks kind of roller-esque.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:01 - 01:35:04]** He has these huge tusks coming out of his face.

**[01:35:04 - 01:35:07]** The blue hue of his tusks is what I'm... Huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:08 - 01:35:09]** Terrifying.

**[01:35:09 - 01:35:10]** Yeah, so he actually...

**[01:35:11 - 01:35:18]** I believe he almost has a bone skull over his face because he's actually like a dark gray and his tusks match the color of his skin.

**[01:35:18 - 01:35:20]** Let me just give you a couple of facts about this guy.

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:21]** He is 12 feet tall.

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:24]** He is large, monstrous.

**[01:35:24 - 01:35:26]** He weighs about 500 pounds.

**[01:35:26 - 01:35:27]** Weighed in at 500 pounds.

**[01:35:28 - 01:35:31]** And you guys would actually remember a little bit of information about this guy.

**[01:35:31 - 01:35:32]** He's a Shabbat.

**[01:35:34 - 01:35:36]** He is, in fact, Dotrulu.

**[01:35:37 - 01:35:39]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:39 - 01:35:40]** That's no true.

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:41]** That's no true.

**[01:35:43 - 01:35:43]** Oh, no.

**[01:35:43 - 01:35:44]** This is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:46]** Will we survive?

**[01:35:46 - 01:35:47]** This combat survey says.

**[01:35:48 - 01:35:48]** Find out next time.

**[01:35:48 - 01:35:50]** Find out next time.

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:51]** Find out next time.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:56]** On Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:35:56 - 01:35:59]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:35:59 - 01:36:05]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
