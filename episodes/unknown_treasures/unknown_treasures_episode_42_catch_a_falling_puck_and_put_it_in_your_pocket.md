**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:02]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** My name is Kevin Decker.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:04]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:05]** Just one more time.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** We have four more players.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:13]** We have Will, Kelly, Vinny, and John.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:13]** Round of applause.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:13]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:18]** We're applauding for ourselves individually in our own rooms across the country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Is that what just happened?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** No, I was applauding for the four of you.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:27]** You're applauding for four other people or selectively choosing which of the ones you want to applaud for.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** And hopefully our listeners are applauding with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Yeah, if you're listening, applaud.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:35]** And send a picture of you applauding or a video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:42]** I was also intentionally clapping to screw up John when he goes to try to match our audios up, but it's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Good luck with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** Oh, sorry Vinny.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** I would have done it on this one if I knew it was Vinny doing it.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Oh wow, thanks.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** That's so nice of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** What episode is this?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Is this 42?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** 42.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:57]** To life and meaning and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** Speaking of, I am still reading that book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** I started that back in March when we started recording this.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** March of 2020?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** I read as slow as I run campaigns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** What's after whatever it's called?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** What are you going to read next after this book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** I have no idea.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** I need to get through this book.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** I have some comic books sitting on my shelf that I need to read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** What's everyone reading?

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** I just restarted a series that I really enjoy by a guy named Will White.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** The series is called Cradle.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** I think it's like 13 or 14 books.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:35]** Each of them is like 300 to 400 pages, but it is the fastest 300 to 400 page novel I've ever read.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** I will check that out.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:50]** The genre is called a lit RPG where the main characters level up each book and sort of increase their powers, but it's really deep.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** There's a love story.

**[00:02:52 - 00:03:04]** He's kind of a castaway in his own society trying to earn their respect and sort of eschews all of the unnecessary baggage thrust upon him.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:08]** and goes out on his own and and you know you got to read the book to find out the rest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** I like it.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** You and Andrew have been trying to get me to read that for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Yep.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Shout out to Andrew Hansen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Just kidding, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Yeah.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** I need to read it.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** It's on my fantasy list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** I haven't read a fantasy book in forever.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** I think the last one I read was His Dark Materials.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** That was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Is that book good?

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Because I watched the first season of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:33]** It's way better than the season, as you might expect, but it's totally different in color and character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I didn't hate the show.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** It just felt...

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** It felt off.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** It's a really hard thing, I think, to make into a show.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** It's just because it's a very... I don't know.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** It's a pretty involved story.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** Right now, I'm reading a book by Bill Clinton called Back to Work.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** It's just his ideas on policy and stuff like that.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Ironic about politicians talking about work, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:07]** Although, whatever your views on Bill Clinton might be, I do know that he did work a lot.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** That mother f***er barely slept.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** Except for his interns.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Except on an island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Allegedly, yeah.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:20]** To be fair, I don't think he was sleeping with his interns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:26]** I am currently reading still the ultimate hitchhiker guide to the galaxy.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** I love the book.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** I just, I always tell myself I'm going to read and then I fall asleep instead.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** But you were asking like what I'm going to read next.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:47]** There was, this is a fun story is, and Lauren Epps, my wife actually hates it, but I taught Grayson to say soylent green is people, which is the cutest thing a child could say without realizing like what it means.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Sorry, that green is PayPal.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:53]** Yeah, but he says it like really casually, like, Grayson, what is Soylent Green?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** And he goes, Soylent Green is people.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Yes, yes.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** But it is actually based on a book that I'm going to probably pick up.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** The book is called Make Room, Make Room.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:08]** And I'm very curious, like, because I've seen the movie and I, you know, I'm curious what the book is about because I like classic sci-fi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Kevin's been trying to get us to read Philip K. Dick a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:16]** Crazy fun fact, Soylent is an actual brand.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Yes.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Meal replacement shakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Yeah, it's pretty good.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:24]** It's the start of the post-apocalyptic future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:28]** As soon as you come out with a Soylent green version, that's when you're like, ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Their mint chocolate one is green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Yeah.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** They know what they're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** I hope so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:39]** Once again, furthering the idea that mint is evergreen and horrible because it's people.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Let's have another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Thin mints are so good, though.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** So if they're made of people, I'm for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** Yeah, I like frozen people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** I mean, frozen thin mints.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I agree with that for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** The thin mints need to be frozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** They're delicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** Wait, John, what book are you reading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:01]** I usually read two things at a time, not literally at once.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Dude, that'd be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:08]** A Starfinder AP book and a Player 10 core rule book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Are we counting APs in this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** Oh, dude, I feel like that's just... Starfinder reading APs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Where's that land?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** That's a good question.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yeah, because I've been reading some Pathfinder APs.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Let me see.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Doing some deep research for threefold.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** Anyway, I have been reading two things.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:31]** One, nonfiction, because I just, I don't know, I'm trying to make myself read things that I don't naturally like.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** You know, like it's very easy to read fantasy and sci-fi.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** I'm trying to read other things.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:40]** And I'm reading Leaders Eat Last, which has been interesting.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** It's a good book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Solid.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Love Simon Sinek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Yeah, it was good.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:52]** And then fantasy-wise, I did finish Terry Pratchett's The Color of Magic, which is the first in his series.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:58]** And I have to say, everyone was always like, oh, Terry Pratchett's hilarious and he's great.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** And they had that book that he wrote with Neil Gaiman, hilarious.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** What's that called, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** American Gods?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** No, different one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** That's just... Good Omens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Good Omens, yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** That was great.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:18]** But I have to say, the color magic is both rich, funny, and, like, surprises you.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:41]** and there's just something about the like comedy aspect of like fantasy and sci-fi that you can really make some choices that you're like i was not expecting that and that was really well done like i just thought i'd be reading be like haha this is funny and then there's a story that goes along with it and it's like no there's a really good story and the writing is really really funny so i highly recommend it it's like 150 pages


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** That's how I feel about Hitchhiker's Guide.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:49]** It is funny and well-written.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:53]** The first book that ever made me laugh out loud was Catch-22.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** I recommend everybody read that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** It's great.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Don DeLillo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** The TV show's pretty good, too.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I don't know if we talked about that before.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Will, what are you reading?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** Man, I read... If it's nothing, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** I'm reading a lot.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** I read...

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** pretty often I read like history.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:25]** Uh, I read a lot of like leadership books, team building, that type of, you know, stuff to help me get ahead at work or, you know, help me to manage the stress of my daily life.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Um,

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:50]** for fun i'm reading the um it's like a compare ancient greek economy by uh siderosa i think is the author just just for the memory of it because you were there when it happened yeah i'm trying to recollect the last time that i was uh in the diachronic era um thinking jack check

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** The Iron Age of economics, you know.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Actually, it does sound really interesting, though.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** It does, actually.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** It's really interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** It's really cool.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:04]** Can I also say a fun phenomenon that I noticed the last time that I was at a Barnes & Noble?

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:10]** That if you go into the section about history that is like, you know, the one that has books like Willow's Reading.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** What's a Barnes & Noble?

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** Okay, we're going to move past it.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:20]** So if you go into a bar... If you go into the last bookstore in downtown... There's only one.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** It's the very last.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:26]** What I love about history books is that there's a history book about every...

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:56]** material good and its impact on history there's like wood and then how it impacts ships there's one for like concrete and how there's one for like gold like silver like I guarantee you just skim the titles and there's something about a material that is throughout history and its impact and I think that's so neat that we can look back and say this is how like wood affected civilizations this is how currency this is how alcohol like we can do all that super neat that is really cool I like deep dives into topics like that it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** I'm reading the full title.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:06]** I wasn't sure it was on my iPad, but it's The Cambridge Companion to the Ancient Greek Economy, edited by Sidavon Reardon.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** That'll jam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Yeah.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Well, do you guys know what I'm going to read?

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:17]** I'm going to read my synopsis for the last episode.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** You know what?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** Let's play.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Your transitions just keep getting better and better.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I'm working on them.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** I'm trying.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Better and better.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** All right.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:28]** So last time, Terme went down with a critical hit.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:37]** Then Chak and Thaddeus missed, but Rolu hit the incorporeal Lashunta with a breath of fire and a firm remark.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:43]** The Lashenta responded by tearing open the drift around Rolu before vanishing through the wall.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:52]** Not knowing where she was going to pop up next, you all went back to back to back to back in like true action movie style.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:59]** And as that Lashenta flew through the wall, Rolu blasted it, knocking it out of the air and out of existence.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** You took this time then to rest.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:09]** And during that, Chak and Termay witnessed that same Lashunta, but like a less deadly version of it.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:16]** It walked out and through the room and actually through Termay and out the door.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:20]** You finished up your rest and headed for those double doors to the north.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** As that door opened...

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** I gave you a little cutscene of Vari 13 confronting the true warriors outside the Stellar Flare.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** And I gave you a cutscene of Vari 8.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:38]** They put something in one escape pod and then jumped into another as a creature was reaching for them.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** That creature could pass through walls.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** Just a note.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** And they watched the Stellar Flare explode.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Vinny, you had a question about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** Yeah, because, like, the whole thing exploded.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** So, what ship are we on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** Interesting.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Give me... This is... Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Vinny, what's your culture modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Culture or engineering.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** I'll give you that.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** Or piloting, even.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** You guys have piloting?

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Who has piloting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** I have piloting, plus seven.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** I have piloting.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** All right.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Try that.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:13]** Just imagining Chalk Pilot of... Yeah, right.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** I did it just for the lulz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** Right.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** A tiny little ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:28]** I have the DC goes down by five if this is for knowledge of commercial organizations or businesses, by the way.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Is it?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Okay.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** I think that's enough.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:44]** It also kind of clarifies back in that fight with the Junk Golem, you were kind of drawn to the console because that was actually the console from the Stellar Flare.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** It was the main console, like the command console that you'd find in the bridge.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** And you know from exploring the area that you've explored –

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:58]** like you've only explored what would be maybe a third of the type of vessel that the stellar flare was.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** So yes, it exploded.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** It was torn to shreds and then it fell to Akiton.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** So you're actually only in a, in a section of the full stellar flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Okay.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:14]** But these little incorporeal things have been around for a while.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** I mean, 300 years, they were children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:23]** According to the IDs you picked up, one was a research technician and the other one was the science officer on board.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** So it would make sense that they were in the lab section.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** But yeah, they've been dead for 300 years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** But also Vary encountered something like that, it appears.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Or something similar, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Vary encountered... Vary ate...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Variate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** Variate encountered something that could pass through walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** And had pitch black eyes.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** From across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Gray.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Is it a gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** One may never know.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:55]** So those doors slide open in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Whoa.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:05]** You see this expansive laboratory that lies in shambles.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:12]** Counters pulled from the floor and hurled from across the room.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** There's left patches of exposed wires and shards of metal everywhere.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:21]** There's unidentified prototype equipment that lies smashed to bits.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:30]** The only exception to all this junk and rubble is the exception of the humming starship power core in the center.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:46]** of the room and the desk just to the left of it with a small thin bodied figure with a large elongated head and pitch black eyes Ray I knew it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** I hate greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Is it not revealed?

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Sorry.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** It's revealed.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** Kevin, what did you do?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** It's eerie in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Uh-huh.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** Go ahead.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Give me an engineering check, somebody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** All right.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** I'm on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** I'll assist.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** It's a 24.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Plus two.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** That's a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** What are you freaking out about, Kelly?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:21]** Kevin, remember that gray in the threefold conspiracy, our main show, where they could teleport through walls?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** It was like a gray dog with a little spike tail thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** The gray bounder?

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Is that what this is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** The gray bounder.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** The gray bounder.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** Or some gray that has similar properties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** This is more like, is it X-Tiomi, I think, was the one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Oh, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Okay, got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** It's still a gray-like thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, a gray-like thing.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** Well, the gray-bounder was like a dog version of grays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** So I guess grays themselves can teleport through shit, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** I'm just going to say whether this stays on air in the ep or not.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** I don't think Rulu...

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** Verla's seen a lot.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** I think we've all seen a lot.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** I don't think I've ever seen this.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** So that's how I'm going to play it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Yeah, I don't think any of your characters would know this.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** Right.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:07]** So you as a player can be excited all you want, but you as a player character.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** What is this place?

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:17]** So your engineering check, you know that this is the prototype drift power core that's in the center of the room, right?

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:24]** While much of the room has been destroyed, you know that the damage is not the result of the Stellar Flare's crash.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:30]** The Drift Power Core seems to have been refurbished, and it functions well enough to provide intermittent power to the rest of the ship.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** That's how some of the doors were able to open.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** That's how the security bot was able to recharge.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:43]** So the creature, the gray, at that computer screen, doesn't even look up.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:47]** But you all can hear a voice in your head.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** No, stop it, Kev.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** You brought it to me.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** That is very kind.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** I wonder, whatever came of my drift, Gollum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** Apparently, get it and come back to the ship was not clear enough directive.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** No, that was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** What are you saying to this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** Either way, I'll take my gym back now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:21]** and suddenly you are all engulfed in complete darkness.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** Even your dark vision fails, Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** I have night vision or something.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** Is that also bad?

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** You have...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:37]** Oh, I think I made another page to carry you guys over to, but I screwed it up.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** It's fine.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** No worries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Just picture you're in dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** No, it's gone.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I don't know where it's at on drill 20.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** It's fine.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** So theater of the mind.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** You're all.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Yeah.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** No, that's going to complicate things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Okay.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** Shadow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** You're in complete blackness.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** All of you.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Complete blackness.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** But.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** My eyes are closed.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** My eyes are closed, Kevin.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:13]** There is a dim circle of blue light, as if somebody is holding a flashlight through cloth.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:22]** Rolu instinctively clasps one of his hands over it, but the glow shines through his hand, revealing bones and veins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:28]** That belongs to me, and I want it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** It's that thing that Rolu took with his sneaky, sneaky susness.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** It wants it from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** I think we should just give it to him.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** What do you guys think?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** What the hell is that, Rolu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** Who is this?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Do we see this?

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** Do we know this is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** You guys are all in complete blackness, but you can hear it.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** You can hear that voice in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:01]** Hey, I think we should... Yeah, let's... Sure, you can have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** What do you want with this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Explain what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:15]** There is no outcome in which whatever this creature is can have this.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:20]** It's imperative that we don't give it to him.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Why do you want this?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Rolly just shouts into the cavernous room.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Hey guys, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** None of that concerns you.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** It belongs to me, and I want it now.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** And you feel it kind of pull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** Hey, we're all about getting property to its rightful owners and such.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** We are not.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** We can be cool about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Hey, Sir May, you know we're pirates, right?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** That's kind of the opposite of what we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Yeah, of course I know that.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** We have to bluff them.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:58]** The captain, is this sanctioned by the captain, this thing that you have, or is this your own little thing that you're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** To bluff?

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:03]** I know that we are not... I did my purview, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:09]** We have not always seen eye to eye, but I need you to trust me when I say...

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** that I need to keep a hold of this.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** And I'll tell you more about it afterward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** I don't know who I trust less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** I just need you to trust me.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** That's not convincing.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:33]** We're here on behalf of the captain's order to do certain things, and you're making us engage an enemy.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** Amen.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:37]** Based on some, what, some, like, some personal thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:44]** This is not the first time that you have not had your own stake in a mission or a situation.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** It might be personal, but it's important.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** This can save the fact worlds.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** This is important.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** Save them from what exactly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** I can't go into it now, but I just can't.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** Let's back out.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Let's leave.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Let's leave this room for what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** You're free to leave.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Let's try to get out.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** I don't know if that's really a wise course of action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** How is that not a wise course of action to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:21]** I think Rolu just started trying to use the light, the blue light, things about maybe trying to turn around or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Kind of walk back.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Let's come back with reinforcements.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Let's throw goblins at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Yes, yes.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** Hey, hey, hey, friend, gray guy, what's your name?

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** What should I call you, lord?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** That seems quite appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** Do you have another name you go by?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Can I do a mysticism or a culture?

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Sorry, sorry, Will, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** You could do a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** I don't have life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Nobody has life science?

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** I don't have life science.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** I have it.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** Most unprepared group of 16.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** I have life science.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Don't you dare.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** So you all know that she is, in fact, a Kray.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Oh, wow.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:14]** And what you recognize is that she is fairly old.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** Like at least 300 years, would you say?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** I would say approximately.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Wow, okay.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Yeah, it's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Hey, you've been around the block, I think.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** You know, tell us more about what you're going to do.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** I'm really interested in following what's going on.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** To me, it's high as f*** right now, I feel.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** To me.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** We don't know what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Yeah, of course we don't.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** I will give you my name in exchange for your gem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** Well, I don't have the gem, but I'm going to help you get it.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** So may this better be a really good plan.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** No, let's get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:59]** The darkness fades away, and the purple-pink glow of the drift drive returns, and I need you all to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** We were all going to roll for initiative anyway, right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** I mean, well, everybody involved has to roll for initiative either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:12]** But we were going to fight this thing.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:15]** Like, if we tried to run, it was not going to have it, right?

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** That's what you were holding for a minute for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** I mean, like, I can't answer that kind of stuff.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** But, like, what are you asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Forget it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** That's too much mitigating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Let's keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:36]** I was only trying, just, just metagame for, indulge me a metagame moment for 10, 15 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** This metagame moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Brought to you by Will Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Will Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:50]** Will, no relation, says, so I was just trying to lull, I wanted to get more information out of this person before we try to kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** That makes sense.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:59]** Well, metagame-wise, we dealt with greys during We'll Save on the main game.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Of course.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:07]** You know they are incredibly elusive, and nobody in existence has ever verified the fact that these things exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** That's why I'm trying to get it in conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** Your life science check was just enough.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:19]** I recognize I've heard about these things in history books or somewhere in conspiracy theories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** It's like talking to a Plato about Atlantis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** I'm not sure what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** I'm not a Greek bender right now, remember?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Classical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:34]** Yeah, I mean, this is literally like now if we were walking into a room and we saw a gray.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:38]** We'd be like, this is in lore and conspiracy theory.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** There's no way this is real.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** I'm both surprised and not surprised at the same time.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Also a little terrified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:48]** I'm trying to make first contact here before I get creamed.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:55]** And all you know is that this gray in particular wants whatever is in Rolu's pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** So clarifying question.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:03]** When we were all in magical darkness, was Rolu the only one that could see the glowing blue light or could we all see the blue glowing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** You could all see the glowing blue light.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** The glowing blue light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** The glowing blue light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** The glowing blue light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** The glowing blue light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:14]** And that's when Rollu clasps his hand over it, you saw his hand.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Like, you didn't even know it was in Rollu's pocket.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** You just saw a hand pass over, and then you saw veins and bone.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** You know how if you shine a really bright flashlight through your hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Like that.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** So, again, you don't necessarily know it's Rollu.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:35]** Until, like, the darkness fades away and your orientation towards R'lyeh is like, oh, it was R'lyeh all along.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** So, sorry, John.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** I let the cat out of the bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** No one's surprised.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** What is your initiative?

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** What is your initiatives?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** All right.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** R'lyeh, sorry.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Nine for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Nine for Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Eight for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Eight for Thaddeus.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Wow, these are really low guys.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** It's like you guys are distracted by something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** 16 for Tomei.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** 24 for Rollo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Oh!

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** I love my favorite thing about

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:27]** playing any kind of like RPG tabletop RPG is like when dice rolls just makes sense yeah tell a story the fact that like Rolu is the one that's like ready and everybody else is like what the fuck man what's going on here um cause yeah okay it makes sense too cause I'm like trying to engage in conversation and like and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:36]** This creature is just gonna... And Roller's just, like, dead set on keeping this stone away from this creature.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** And he's just, like, hypervigilant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** Yeah.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** And with that, it's Roller's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:43 - 00:27:07]** rolo wants to leave and my question is can i do a perception check to see if there's anywhere closer in this room from where i can i'm standing at the threshold of the door because rolo realizes that it's a ways back to get to the front of the ship or their entrance originally and rolo doesn't know what this creature is capable of so he's almost like i this this he was talking in his head and he wants to leave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:11]** You want to do a perception check as if there's another exit within this laboratory area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** Is there a closer exit than... Roll a perception for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** It's 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** 22.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** So you are at the threshold of the door.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** It's you and Thaddeus are kind of in the front.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** And you can see that this is just a lab.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:35]** There is no other entrances except through the clean room, airtight room that you are standing in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Okay, that's it.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** All right.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** You might hate me for this, Kev, but I think it's the only thing to do.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** Rulu's going to use a move action to close the door, and he's going to run the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** He's going to pull a Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:56]** He's going to pull a Thaddeus, and he is going to run through the clean room that's about 10 feet and make it about 20 feet down the hall if he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** For once, I feel like we're on the same page, Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Let's get the hell out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** Of course, Thaddeus would want to run away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** Yeah, but I used a move action, I think, to close the door.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** Unless Kev says it's a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** No, it's definitely a move action if you want to close that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Yeah.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** It's playing to your character.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** It makes sense.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** And, yeah.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** We don't want to engage in things we don't need to get.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** Our whole mission in coming into this ship was to do what exactly?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Just explore it, essentially, right?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** See what the big secret was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:31]** You were trying to locate whatever technology Varya 8 was working on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** It's really unclear, though, why, though, we're doing that.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** It would...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** We found it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** It should be this drift drive, though, yeah.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:41]** I mean, as far as the captain's mission, I don't know where this fits in, frankly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Well, yeah, it involves Vahri.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:51]** Remember, I think Chak had said, and slash Venny, that, you know, not the water dealer, but the true warriors were interested in...

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** Vahri, so if we follow Vahri, then maybe that will lead us to more of the overarching mission.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:06]** But I think for now, Rolu, his desire for this right now supersedes all of that, so he's going to start to walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** All right, so Termay, it's your turn.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:17]** So just for the listeners, Rolo shut the door and then walked 30 feet to the south.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** He's now between those two doors.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** We're leaving.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:27]** The hallway where the two doors were leading into the room with the computer and the room where the ghosts were.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Yeah.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Okay.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** So Treme, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:38]** Tremé is going to follow Rolu, but not really follow Rolu.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** Just going to take a minor step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** Be like, oh, I got to get these things off.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Hey, your name again.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** I'm sorry.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:58]** It's easier to call you something rather than to try and... Your lordship, Grey Lady...

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** You look fantastic, by the way.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** How old are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** Sorry, so you're trying to communicate how?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** I thought we were telepathically communicating.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Also, I have the mind circlet.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Mind link circlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** But the door is closed.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Do you have to have vision?

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** And what is your range?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** It's like not very far.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** I think it's like 30 feet or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** I think it's 30 feet.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Yeah, 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** Yeah, I don't think you're within 30 feet of her.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Okay.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:36]** I feel like... So if I were to use the circlet with Rolu, can I presume that they can't hear?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:42]** I don't know if you could presume that, but... Can I do a life science to see if I could think?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:47]** Hey, I'll try to address... I feel like it'd be a... I already tried to address this person.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Do I hear anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Nothing returned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Okay.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** Rolu, keep running.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** We'll try to stall her.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** And, uh...

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** Maybe we can, I don't know.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** I don't know how to fight this thing.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** I don't know what we're dealing with, but I agree.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** We shouldn't just hand over anything.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** You just hear a quick, like, acknowledgement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Head nod, like, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:31]** And then, yeah, so I'm going to just kind of move to the edge of this and sort of feign like I'm struggling to get, you know, like things situated as I attempt to, quote unquote, run after this person.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** And then, yeah, I'm just going to ready.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:40]** If I see the great path through or come near me.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** I might try to trip them up.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:45]** I might try to just stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** This is wild, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:51]** You're saying you're going to hold to do... Yeah, I'm going to try and stall the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** You're going to try to do a combat maneuver if they pass you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** I don't have my coral reel bug with me right now.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** You're just readying in action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** Because you have... Delaying your turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** Yeah, I'm delaying my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** You're delaying your full turn?

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** Then you need to move back to where you were because you took a step.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Okay, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:11]** So if you're delaying your full turn... I'll delay my full turn until the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** All right.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** So that's your fault.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** You're delaying your turn is your turn.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** Next is Chuck.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:19]** What are you doing?

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** I hope it involves a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** No, Chuck has seen enough bullshit.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** he's ready to get out of Dodge.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** He's with Rolu.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** Uh, technically he also thinks drawing this thing out is a good idea.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:45]** And so, um, however, he also thinks that all of us running in the same direction is not a wise choice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** It's Chuck.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** No, Shaq.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** No.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** No, Shaq.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Don't do it.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:58]** So Chuck is going to come down out of the door and hang a left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** Kevin, have mercy on Shaq.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** He does.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** He know not what he do.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** This could be the kill zone here, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** So that's his move action.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:13]** And then he's going to ready his fast fault blaster for in case the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** Oh, I see.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** You're camping to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:20]** So you took one move action and your second move action is readying your fast fault rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:23]** Yeah, my second action is going to be readying my asphalt blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** All right, I'm following.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** I'm with it.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:33]** Thaddeus was also thinking that it's good to draw him out away from a potential power source and the place that she is camping out.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** He's just going to move next to Rulu.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:43]** And ready his, uh, his formium venom caster, in case it shows up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** He's gonna go hide next to Rollu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:51]** Rollu, we're probably gonna have to make our stand here, because I think our mission ultimately is that purple thing in there.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** That source of the ship.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Very likely is that.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Now, I know you have your own personal thing going on, but we have a mission to do.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** But let's draw him out.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Take him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:15]** I like to think that Rolu started running and then slowed down as Tremei was talking to him, and then you, like, caught up, and now Rolu's thinking with what you said and with what, you know, it's like, and, yeah.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** It's just, it's a cool moment.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** Kev looks a little... He expected us probably to, like, fight it in there.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** And now he's like, ah, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** I'm also having problems with Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Welcome to GMing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:37]** Where the points sort of matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** The points kind of matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** But the games are definitely made up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** They are definitely made up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** And they're awesome.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** It's Rolo's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** The gray doesn't move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Classic.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** That was good.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** That was good.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** I mean, it's smart on the gray's part, I guess.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Yeah, we just don't know.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Oh, we don't know.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Yeah.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:09]** Rulu, I think, pauses at Thaddeus' word.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** I don't trust Kev's smile right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** Yeah, I definitely don't trust this one at all.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:21]** Oh, Kev, now you know how to hide the areas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Man, I'm having such a hard time with this.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** You guys get off my back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** You're doing a great job.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Don't worry, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:30]** It's not like Roll20 is difficult to use as a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** It's not at all.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Roloo stops.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** That is.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Are you sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Sure about what?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** About fighting it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Yes.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** Look, one way or another, we have to get that power source.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** You're sure about that?

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** Well, that's what What's-Her-Name was talking about.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** What's-Their-Name, sorry, was talking about, Bari, right?

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:01]** About there being some thing in a ship that could move it through the drift at some speed or whatever.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** I was barely paying attention.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** But we need to do, we need to get that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** I don't care how we do it.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:11]** We can go and get the people outside and bring them in now that we've cleared this out.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** And that would be smart.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:18]** But ultimately, we have to come back and fight her out of that chamber.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** You know what I mean?

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** They've already suffered enough.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** No, no, no, Rolo.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Enough.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** No, no, no.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** They were fighting us earlier.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** They're space goblins.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** That's what they do.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** They just fight things and fight over trash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** We need to have compassion here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** No, Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** We need a mission.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** We have to finish a mission.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** We do.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** We don't need to bring them in.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** I think we are on the same page.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** No, we're obviously not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:47]** As you guys are arguing about it, you're shouting back and forth, but there is a very loud echo.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Cough.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** What?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:59]** As you realize the front door that you guys came through to get into this laboratory area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Slams shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** With Treme inside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** All of you.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** The door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** The front door that we went into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** That we came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Yeah.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** To the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** Where the scanner was, where you fought the turret.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** That door slammed shut.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** You could hear an echo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** They put it in the ship in panic mode.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Of course, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** Oh, my...

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** Well, it looks like we have one option left then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** It looks like we're rats trapped in a cage, it would seem.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Better play ball, so to speak.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Roll to get ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Wink, wink.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** Ready to fire something.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Get ready with a weapon or spell.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** It's time.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** It's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** I think Rollu looks at you.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:50]** I just took a page from Chuck's book and rolled a D100 to see if I trust Thaddeus.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Love it.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Rolu shakes his head a bit.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** Would I know that that door, that the sound of that thing slamming is the way out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** I mean, you guys have explored.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** Is it a low enough frequency for us to localize it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** That's what I was going to ask.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** That's what I was going to ask.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Well, it's actually a high frequency, so you caught it right away.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** You're like, oh, it's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:15]** It's like all the doors from every direction close simultaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Dude, that would be awesome.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Rolu raises his serpent.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:31]** laser rifle and points it at the vibratory door that he shut before he is getting ready to fight whatever this thing is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:37]** All right, everyone, we honestly have no idea which direction it's coming from, so look alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Savvy.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** That's my turn.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** I'm going to be ready to fire if I see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:50]** Actually, I made a mistake because technically Treme... Oh, you said Treme, you triggered if... If I see the gray... Treme delayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Yeah, I delayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:57]** Okay, you did not see the gray, so your delay goes... What were you at?

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:01]** I see where you... You would be next, so you are now... Yeah.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** It is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:10]** Okay, so I'm actually going to use this opportunity to equip my grifter kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** It's provocative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** It's provocative.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:21]** I think I get a bonus to sleight of hand checks to pick pockets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Okay.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** I'm not sure how that's going to help you.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Don't you do that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:37]** I have a wild theory in my head that this gray is trying to join two pieces of technology on her person.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:50]** So if I can separate the gray from the piece that's perhaps either fueling her rage or perhaps empowering her in some way, then maybe.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Maybe.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** I don't know.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** It's a theory.

**[00:39:54 - 00:40:20]** i'm gonna pretend i'm gonna pretend that i am a uh look i have a very charisma based character yeah metagame totally i am going to pretend that i am playing along as long as possible before i you know magic missile and then effectively try to draw as much information as possible from this creature in order to defeat it that's my strategy

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:41]** i love it so just to clarify you are i just i equipped your grifter yeah so i i usually i have like my melee i have four arms uh so i have my melee weapon usually out and my pistol usually out and now i just have my pistol out and my grifter kit you still have two free hands

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Yeah, I still have two free hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Okay.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:51]** But I have a two-handed melee weapon, so... You still have one two-handed melee weapon, one grifter, and one pistol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:57]** Yeah, I mean, I could do that, but the way that I read it, I guess I could do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Yeah, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Forget it.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** That's what I got.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** That's what I got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** So you're equipping your grifter and then doing what?

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Are you holding an action again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Yeah, I'm holding an action, I guess.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** I don't know.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:12]** I'm going to try and pick his pocket if he passes by me, and I'm going to...

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:39]** probably do like a diplomacy to change his attitude towards me because i feel like i've been talking to him enough as as his quote-unquote willing subject um and i'm gonna help him get his her i'm sorry i'm gonna help her get her thing and you know see what okay all right i copy i follow man you're gonna make me move the thing again yeah making your job hard delaying is the most annoying anyways


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:44]** Well, since my ready action didn't actually happen.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** I'm going to hold the line.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:49]** I'm going to re-ready my two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:55]** So are you delaying your full action or are you readying one action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** I'm readying an attack action.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** And I think we might be misplaying this.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:08]** So when you delay, you are moving yourself in the initiative order to after another character's turn.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** Either way...

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** Either way, you're moving yourself initiative.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** When you're ready in action, you only move if it's triggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** If it's triggered, okay.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** When you delay, you move in the turn order.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:26]** You go back to the bottom.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** All right.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** I'll believe that.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** You guys are messing this.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Give me a headache.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:35]** So I'm just going to re-ready my two attacks for when I see the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** I didn't put another one in the fridge.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Thanks for reminding me.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Cool.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Okay.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** I'm going to screw up this initiative order all over the place.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** So you guys delaying everything.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** But Chak, that's your turn.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:52]** You're delaying an action, not delaying your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** No, Chak is readying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** Readying an action, not delaying my turn.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** Correct.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Okay.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Still having my action ready.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** He's just watching.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:06]** He's going to roll perception to see if he can maybe sense that it moved around locally somehow.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** It's 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** Do you have any kind of sense besides vision?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** Do you have blind sense of some sort or blind sight?

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I have dark vision.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Do you have dark vision?

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** I think we talked about that.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Okay.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** That doesn't help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** That doesn't help me.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** I have low light vision and dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** You see a door in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** You see a shut door in front of you because Ralu shut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** That's it.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Enter me standing in front of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:31]** Cool.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Okay.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** Okay.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Survival with that help.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:38]** I mean, you know, I can't roll anything to figure out where this thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** You know, it's behind that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Yeah.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** All right.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** We don't know that.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:53]** And I think honestly, like, even if you were like trying to perceive, like you would hear the zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom of the, of that engine, the, the drift drive over anything else.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Cool.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** So it remains readied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:02]** With that, we're all waiting with bated breath here, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:08]** I'm trying to think of the best way to do this because, all right, let's see.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** You're not going to see a difference, Will.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Oh, come on, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** I'm kind of not happy about Tremay.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** What am I not seeing?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I'll buy Tremay.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Tremay just vanished.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Yeah, Tremay vanished.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** Yeah, so Tremay can't see it because the way I have his vision set up.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** And I just moved the circles in the wrong spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** Thaddeus, I feel like as we're waiting and we're like tensely like looking, I feel like he's like, what do you think?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Shut the door.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** Do you think it was that creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:46]** So what you guys see is this growing darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** A wall.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** A wall of black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:57]** And Tremé is alone inside of it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** Tremé, you can't see anything either.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Your dark vision does not work here.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** I'll turn out the lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:12]** Lord, your name again.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:19]** I couldn't grab the gem in time, but... Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** And do you have any kind of blind sense?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** I feel like I would remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** I think it's over where you'd have your dark vision.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Yeah, I don't see blind sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Yeah, just dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:38]** I'm trying to think, because I think here's had blind sense vibration or something.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** That's the only time we ever ran into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:46]** Oh, man, this is... I just imagined it happening, and we're like... For me?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Like, we can't see you.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:52]** It's just pitch black in literally at the intersection of the hallway.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** Like, even chalk, I feel like you can't see the other end of the hallway anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** Yeah, it's not good, man.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** It's not good.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** How are we going to attack if we can't see it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:09]** I don't... From a distance, maybe, but... Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** I can't say that.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:15]** I'm not saying that because I think you should just turn it over the gem, guys.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Wink, wink.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Take care, Freeze.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Oh, he's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** I'm still here.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** It is an option.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** I wonder if we could negotiate with it if we could get rid of the gem.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:33]** And it will let us... What are your plans, Lord, for this wondrous cause of yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** Rolu asked and it said it doesn't concern you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** What was... Oh, are you guys talking to each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:42]** No, I'm talking... I'm assuming this darkness is your doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Give me the perception check.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** Yeah.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Did you ever give me the...

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** 18.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** 18.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Okay.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:52]** So you do, you, you are in complete blackness.

**[00:46:52 - 00:47:03]** You can't see anything, but you get that sense that, that the creature is now standing next to you and you're trying to communicate with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** So because you did ready, you readied, you say an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Yeah.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:13]** I readied to do a sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** So do your sleight of hand check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Okay.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:27]** And do I, well, I was readying to try, I was trying to like engage this person in conversation as well beforehand to try and distract.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** I think you readied your sleight of hand, not a diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:37]** Well, I did actually mention it prior to, I actually did mention that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** Yeah, but you readied the sleight of hand is all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:51]** Literally said in the same breath, I want to do my diplomacy check as part of my sleight of hand.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** I'll give you that option.

**[00:47:52 - 00:48:03]** It's a 10-minute thing that you have to do to do diplomacy to change somebody's attitude, which is what I mentioned before, but that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** You can pick one or the other.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:11]** You can do diplomacy or sleight of hand because if you're trying to actually change the attitude, it's going to be an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:32]** yeah then i'm doing diplomacy okay roll your diplomacy that is a let me do 17 plus 11 plus my 33 31 31 31 what so what do you say what do you say to her


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** I'm saying to her, uh, she, they, they ran off.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** I couldn't catch them, but, uh, I want to help.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** I, I just, I need to know more.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** Tell me, Lord, what, what do you want of me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** I do not fall for your tricks.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** I know you think me no more than an average creature.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** I need that gem for my own reasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Not the case at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:02]** You are far more extraordinary and exquisite than I could ever imagine.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** I need that gem.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** You either help me get it or you die defending it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:14]** I would never die defending a piece of whatever immaterial consequence.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** It's nothing to me, this gem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:21]** So return it to my possession and everything will be fine for you.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** How can I help?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Get me that gem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Rolo, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:30]** Okay, does Rolo hear any of this in the comms?

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** Or is this all happening in Termay's head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** That was all in Termay's head, and it was specifically for Termay.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** I was like, yo, what is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** All right, I mean, this is just terrifying.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:49]** I'm thinking of it like the hallway before Vader appears.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** It's like this creature that you know nothing about, and it's just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:59]** I think it's worse than Vader, though, because Vader, it was a dark hallway that lights up with a red lightsaber.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** This one is fairly lit.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** It's a dim-lit hallway that goes black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** That just gets dark.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:08]** Tomei, are you okay in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:14]** Yes, just give this creature what it wants, he says very loudly.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Like, too loudly?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:21]** Like, no, just he's talking loudly, not using telepathy.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Treme, come out.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** We can't see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** I don't know where out is.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** I'm in complete darkness.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:32]** Hey, hey, can you turn the lights back on?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** I can't really see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:38]** I'll have to wait till my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:43]** Rolu is just going to squeeze harder on the gun.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:49]** I think there's an uneasiness in his steps as he's trying to calm himself.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:56]** But this is just an overwhelmingly dark situation, for lack of a better term.

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** And he's going to ready his action again to take a shot whenever he sees the gray.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:05]** Can he do a mysticism check on this darkness or the gray at all?

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:06]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** I'll give you that mysticism.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** 17.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** Not enough.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** You recognize darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** That's it.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** That's it.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:23]** Oh, Chuck is quaking in his second skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** Thinking through everything he's seen in the last day.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Fighting Tinkerton.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** The drift demons.

**[00:51:36 - 00:52:06]** seeing the battle of the three armies like this is he's a houseplant so like this is all outside of it like it's one of those where like he thought he could handle the road and he is finding out laughing so you see a little bit of I'm gonna be a real pirate you see a bit of sap running down his leg laughing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:09]** And he's just like, I don't want to be over here by myself.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** It's getting dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:25]** And he sprints around the corner and like climbs up Rolu's robes and onto his shoulder, but like keeps his, his asphalt blaster leveled at the door waiting for the gray to come through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** So you're, you made a move action and you're readying an attack.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:28]** Yeah.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** An attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** A full round attack.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Yeah.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** A full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:47]** Like, Thaddeus, look, I don't trust whatever that is, so I don't know if we can negotiate with it or not, but can your blue gem thing help us attack it?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Will it help us do something like that?

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** I don't know.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Find out.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:58]** Otherwise, I'm going to suggest that we make a trade where it will let us access what we want, and you give it that.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I'm not here for you.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** I'm here for us, our crew, our captain.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** We have something we have to do.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** I don't want to die to this thing for no reason.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** That's not an option for me.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Jesus fucking Christ.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** Thaddeus is just going to try to wrestle with Rolu over it.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** You're going to wrestle Rolu?

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** He's going to try to take it from him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:25]** Give me a... PvP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** PvP.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** PvP.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** PvP.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** One of us.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** One of us.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Roller, you've lost your mind.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Give it up now.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:39]** I'm not saying I'm going to give it to him, but I want to have something to... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** You're going to do a melee combat maneuver, right?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** It's just a tackle.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** It's a tackle or something.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Are you going to tackle him or are you going to try to take away the gem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** I'm going to tackle him to try to take it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** It's two things.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** So you're going to tackle him or take away the gem.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** And I believe either one is still going to be a KAC plus eight.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:03]** So I need you to do a melee attack against his KC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Yeah.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:11]** The situation is quickly devolving, and it's awesome and tense, and I don't know what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** I don't make it.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** It's just a 22.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** Like, I doubt I'm going to be able to roll a 22.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** It's just a 22?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Rollie, what's your KAC plus eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** 23.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Does that pass?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** You were close.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** I think you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:25]** He wasn't expecting you to do it, but as soon as that happens, he pushes you away.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:29]** He's like, I knew I couldn't trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Who can't trust who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** This is not what we're here for.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** What is this about?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** I need to see what it is.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** You don't need to see what it is.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** You need to trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** You can hear what they're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** I don't need you attacking me right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** I love that Chuck is just on your shoulder during this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** He's up his... Yeah, yeah.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** I forgot Chak was on my shoulder.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** No, Chak is on Rolu's shoulder at this point.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** And so, like, Rolu and Thaddeus are going at it and, like, physically wrestling each other.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** And Chak's just like, oh, man, I picked the wrong...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:34]** like a hula girl strutting along it's like a bobblehead can I interject for a moment and say that hearing this bickering I'm gonna use it I'm assuming that the grey can hear it and I'm gonna say to the grey to try and like further change the grey's attitude towards me be like see there bickering sire I can't put my hat in their ring we're just like pulling on each other I'm like pulling on his robes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Yeah.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Give it up!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** I can't see my way out of this.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** Can you turn the lights back on?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** I really can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Thaddeus, I think you might be on the wrong side of this.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** You should probably tone this down.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:53]** I think it's us against this gray, not us against each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Thaddeus does not agree.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:01]** I mean... Was that your turn, Thaddeus?


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Yeah, that's my turn.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** I can't do anything else anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** All right, Ralu, we're back to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Just bolt, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** There's nowhere to go.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Right, we're locked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** Pretend like you're going to bolt.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I don't know.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Draw it out.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** We got to draw it out.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Metagame, we got to draw it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** Thaddeus, just stay away from me.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Or fight with me.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** That's it.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** I'm down to fight with you, but if we don't have to fight, I don't want to.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:28]** All right.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** Rolu is walking back, and one hand is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:53]** like saying like stop towards you and the other two are still pointing towards where that darkness is and he's like to make get out of there right now I don't know what you did why are you taking so much time get out of there I can't see anything Rose gonna move back and he's gonna ready an action to fire at the gray


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:57]** All right, so you guys are moving further and further down the hall, away from that double door.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** Chuck, are you riding with him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** I'm going to hop down.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** Actually, I would like to hop from his shoulder to Thaddeus'.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** Okay.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** And Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** If it's my turn, I'm going to be following Ruler.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Okay, so you're going to run away again.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** Got it.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** Five feet back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** So go ahead and move here.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:19]** Is there a check I can make to understand the magnitude of this threat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** I'm not sure what your question is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:26]** So what I really want to do is try to impress upon Thaddeus.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:30]** It's going to take all four of us to fill this gray.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** And if we're fighting amongst ourselves, we're all going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** You can do a sense motive, I guess.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** I'll give you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:45]** I guess what I don't know is how Chak would know that.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Because I know that because we've faced greys before.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** But I don't know that... Jack has never even heard of a grey before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Right.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:59]** And I don't... Actually, you can't do a sense motto without seeing the creature, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Cool.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** Thaddeus, we've got to stick together.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** That's what we've done this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** This one Rolu alone is endangering us.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** It is because of him that we're in this situation.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** I don't... Because he's stubborn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** I don't know if you were listening.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** He said something about the entire Pact Worlds being in danger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:24]** Rolu... Shaq, do I really need to tell you that Rolu is a liar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** Can I roll Sense Motive on Rolu to see if he was telling the truth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:31]** Yeah, I'm going to say yeah.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** I don't know what would be your counter, John.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** You roll your counter.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Tell me what it is.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Bluff, I guess.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** It's a 14.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** How does Rolu respond?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** I don't think Rolu's responding.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:45]** Chak is remembering to see if he has a sense motive, right?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** He's reviewing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:50]** Right, so is Chak's impression that you were telling the truth or that you were lying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:56]** You are certain that Rolu is convinced that he is telling the truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Okay.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** So he's not lying to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** Thaddeus, I think this is a real threat.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:05]** I've been studying people's faces every day in the captain's office.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** This has been real deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:16]** With everything you learned the other night, remember, you still think that this is legit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** With every fiber within me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Get it?

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Because he's a plant.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Yeah.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Boom.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Boom.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** And that's the trailer.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** For now, we'll find a place to fight.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** And we'll address this later.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:37]** A little bit crestfallen, Thaddeus will catch up with Rolu with Shaq on his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** So he runs away.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Got it.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** Cool.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** Just check it.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** I don't think it's ever been a case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** The murder buttons are going to be in full swing again when we start to recall the background.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** I don't know if there's ever been a situation where Thaddeus is like, don't worry, guys, I'm heading into combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:52 - 01:00:00]** I think without moving my token, I just wanted to be clear that Rolu is trying to keep Thaddeus five feet away.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:04]** So I don't know how that works, but he's trying to keep him away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** He just puts two hands up on one side.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Ah, Thaddeus, Thaddeus, Thaddeus.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Cool.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]** So I got to figure out where my mouse is at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:19]** Look, if Thaddeus was a bender, he would be an airbender, okay?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Obviously.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Look at how he operates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:34]** Avoid strike when... You said if Thaddeus was a bender, and I was like, if Thaddeus was the robot from Futurama?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Yeah, right?

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** I don't know.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** I feel like Thaddeus has, like, Fire Nation energy.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Big Fire Nation energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:45]** The three of you step back another, what, 30 feet?

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:46]** Oh, God.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Down to that hallway.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:56]** And that thick wall of darkness followed and engrossed you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** And that's in front of us as we're running up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** All of you are now inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:23]** of this thick blackness and the only thing you can see is the glowing blue from rolu's pocket that's our game i knew you were gonna end it there oh my god the combat that wasn't combat


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:38]** Until next week, drift begones and distance starves.
