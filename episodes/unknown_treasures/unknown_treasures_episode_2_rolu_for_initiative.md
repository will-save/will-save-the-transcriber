**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan...

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Wind Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:06]** More specifically, Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:10]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:12]** I'm your GM, Kevin.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:18]** And I just need to point out now, I'm sure this is going to wear off sooner or later, but this is my first time ever GMing.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:22]** So if anything goes wrong, if you're not enjoying yourselves, it's my fault.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Please message me directly.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Don't bother the rest of the crew.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** And it's definitely on my shoulders.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:31]** And John, I feel for you every second of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** No.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** I appreciate what you do for us.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** Can I get the tape right now and go back and listen to that again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** So real quick, I just want to go around the room.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:47]** Give me your name and give me your favorite ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Okay.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** This is such a Navy question already.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** This is such a Navy question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** Why is that a Navy question?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** What's your favorite ocean, Kev?

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** I guess there's seven of them and there's five of us.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Yeah, but we can overlap.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** The glee on Vinny's face tells me that he wants to go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** I'm Vinny.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** I'm playing a monkey flower named Jack.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** He's so much fun to play.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:19]** And my favorite ocean is the Atlantic Ocean.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** It's right down the street.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** I get to dip my toes in it every so often.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** The surf is nice to play in.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** My family enjoys it.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** So...

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** Yeah, Atlantic, the hanging fruit.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:34]** Also, Caribbean cruises are my preferred vacation method.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** All things Atlantic, really.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Truly.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, shrimp, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** What about you, Allie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Sorry, did you have more of any?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Tell us more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** I was going to pass it to Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Oh, wow.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Of the same mind we are.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** Yeah.

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:01]** I mean, the ocean I'm most familiar with is the Pacific one where I live and also have been over quite a bit.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** I have been on the Atlantic.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** I mean, you've seen both sides of it.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I mean, I have.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** I've also liked the Caribbean.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** That's a nice area.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** But the place that I really want to go to is the Arctic Ocean, if that's still a thing these days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** Someone had to claim it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** When this airs.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:22]** Because it would be really cool to be on those icebreaker ships that cruise through the ice and crack them as they go to the North Pole.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** That'd be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** But then what if they get stuck?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Because they do get stuck, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Do they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Yeah.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** The Coast Guard has icebreakers that would go save them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:53]** so there's an ice breaking ship to save the ice breaking ship they just show up with a pack of candy we brought you ice breakers I kind of like the polar bear explanation more also most overrated animal in the world still in my opinion but whatever pass it on Kelly pass it on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** All right, let's do John next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** Hello.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:06]** Spoiler, my name is John, and my favorite ocean, you know, being from Jacksonville, Florida, too, I think I got to say it's the Atlantic.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Because it's warm.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** It's warm.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** It's nice.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:09]** It is warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Ron John Surf Shop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Dude, Ron John Surf Shop.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Yeah, Salt Life, dude.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Yeah, it's all good.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** It's all there.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** It's all gravy.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** Beautiful.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** And that leaves us with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** My name is Will.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** I am playing a Witch Warp in Witchward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** It wasn't the question, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I don't know what the question was.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** What's your favorite ocean?

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** My favorite ocean is the Pacific Ocean.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:44]** I'm going to be biased and say because, you know, it's where all my fresh bluefin comes from when I go sushi time.

**[00:04:45 - 00:05:01]** And I just wanted to bring up before we started that the original title of this series was going to be The Interstellar Tales featuring unknown creatures, knickknacks, and trials that have eternally grave and nearly gargantuan breadth across new galaxies.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** But it had to be shortened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Yeah.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** It doesn't all fit onto... It didn't fit on the placard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** It's fine.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** But that's what it was going to be called.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** I fought for it, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** I fought for it.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:12]** Yeah.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Yeah.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** But you guys won.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Yeah, it sucked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:25]** Yeah, so I guess that was a Navy thing, because I spent a lot of my time under the Pacific Ocean, so... Hey-oh.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Pacific's my favorite.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:33]** Okay, but I do want to carry on something that we left off with back at the end of We'll Save.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Two truths and one lie.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** No way!

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** No way!

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Two truths and one lie.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:46]** Okay, so I think I did it, Will did it, so that leaves either Kelly, Vinny, or John.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** Let's go with... I vote not me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Vinny!

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** It's Vinny.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:53]** Vinny was supposed to touch his nose.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** It's classic, man.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Oh, man.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** I'm so glad I volunteered first for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:06]** I feel like I need the, like, who wants to be a millionaire sound, like, you know, the spotlight on Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:15]** I wish you hadn't gone first, Will, because yours was just chef's kiss spectacular.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** All right.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** Two truths and a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** In that specific order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** I've never been in the Pacific Ocean.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:33]** I have never seen a Bond film.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:43]** And I have the cilantro tastes like soap gene.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** I vote number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** That would be really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I didn't know this was a real gene.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** I think that's a straight up lie.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** But man.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** That's totally a gene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Yeah, it is a gene, but I don't think you have it.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** And that's my guess at your lie.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** I love cilantro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** I think it's the Pacific Ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** Yeah, I actually think it's that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Penny, please, please watch a Bond film.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** This can't be real.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** We talked about it.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** I got a trailer for one recently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** You never mentioned in that conversation that you hadn't seen it.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** If I get this wrong, I'm just going to close out of the Zoom.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** This will be the third time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** You've known him the longest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** When was the last time he was like, hey, John, I'm in California?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:26]** I mean, I think I know what that was because I was there.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:26]** You were.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** It was a wild 48 hours.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** That is actually another great story to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** And did you go anywhere near the ocean during that 48 hours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** We were ocean adjacent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:38]** We were ocean adjacent, but technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Dang it.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** That's it.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** That's it.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** You're wrong, John.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** He's so hardcore about the Atlantic Ocean that he refuses.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** I've never been in the Pacific Ocean.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Dang.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** That's the truth.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** That's the truth.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** That's a truth.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** I meant that was a truth.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** I have never seen a Bond film.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** That's a truth.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:59]** So you don't have the gene, I was right.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** I don't have the gene.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** Will's right.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** Dang, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** I didn't know that was a real thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** No, that's totally a gene.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** I don't have it.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I love cilantro.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Cilantro's like life.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** It's like the best spice ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** Even if it tasted like soap, I think I'd still eat it.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** What if somebody made cilantro-flavored soap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** I'd try it.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** I would use that.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** Did I curse too much in class and that's why I taste soap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** If you are listening, please send us a link.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** You mean I could taste cilantro and smell like cilantro?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** No.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I'm not seeing it down to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** I don't get it.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Well, that was fun.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Now on to the real work.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** But let's actually play some Starfinder, huh?

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yes!

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:49]** One more thing before we play Starfinder.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** It's both like Navy and Starfinder related, but also beer type.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:57]** I really got to do a shout out to Heavy Seas, which is a brewery here in Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Of course, that's a Navy term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Are they in Annapolis?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** It's also pirate themed, so I think it's appropriate.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:07]** But this beer is a tropical sour called Cosmic Blur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** Cosmic blur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** Cosmic blur, and you can't really see it on the screen.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** There's a skull with blue and purple rays coming out of it.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** That's a sour?

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** It's a sour.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** What kind of sour?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** It's a tropical fruit sour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** What does tropical fruit mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Man, this is a lot more than I expected.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** Kev, don't open this can of worms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** You came to the wrong place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:35]** Brewed with pineapple, mango,

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Mango.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Passion fruit.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Passion fruit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** It's made with passion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:49]** This interstellar sour is packed with sweet and tart tropical fruit flavors.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:52]** It's also got 9% alcohol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** It's respectable.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** I'm sure it's delicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:58]** It's just a bunch of fruit talking into an intercom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** They're so passionate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Have we established that we're pirates?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** We're pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I don't think we've engaged in any piracy yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** I don't think we've yet.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** That might happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** We're alleged pirates.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Kev, I need to know what music to play right now.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** There's been no music for like a minute and it's killing me.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** Pirate music.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Play pirate music.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Yo, ho, yo, ho.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Like a shanty?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Whatever you got.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Give me some penny whistle.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Give me some strings.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** What the hell is penny whistle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** I do want to go around the room real quick.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:36]** I just want you to give a quick rundown of your character.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** I want to start with Rolu.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Actually, what I want to do, and this is anybody.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** I'll throw this up in the air and maybe we can grab the ball if they want.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** I want kind of a recap of

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:55]** what happened to Rolu, and we'll save the podcast.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Okay.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Who knows goes in it?

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** I think that league.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** I'm surprised.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** I just assumed that John would do that.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** I was asleep under a bush.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** I'm sorry.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Yeah.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** I technically didn't exist.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:15]** Different facets of me existed in NPCs, so I don't know what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** That's true.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** We don't want to break the fourth wall with John too much.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Um, I, uh, okay.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** So Rolu was, uh, here's his, uh, friend.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:30]** And as you have just now learned in unknown treasures, he served under him when here's had his career.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Um,

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:47]** rolu and it's not stated exactly how yet in our campaign but he helped here is uh find the schematics for that ship that he was going on to rescue those people um and uh you're giving us a lot of information

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:56]** I feel like you could surmise it from the flashback that we had before that audio message that was left before Rolu joined this current crew.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:01]** So when he was playing that, he was kind of playing it back to himself, you know, after he'd heard it previously.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** But he...

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:16]** Somehow in the future, I'm not trying to say whether they found out or whatever, but they know that Rulu did something and was trying to help Hears or already did help Hears.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** They knew that he helped them somehow before or after.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:23]** And in the threefold conspiracy in our main campaign, we'll say he was killed.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:29]** Trying to help Hears one more time get back into the Free Captains after he was kicked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** And so that was actually episode one?

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Episode one, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** So, John, your character can't die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Well, he does die.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** We know he dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** No, but not in this campaign.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** John has incredible plot armor.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** Yeah.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** Oh, well.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Do you know that?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** I don't.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Maybe Rolu has like a twin or something.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Have we established a timeline on this?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** It could be that these events happen concurrently.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Simultaneously.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** Or in a different parallel existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** So, I guess I'll shed some light on that.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:13]** The timeline is actually... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Your audio cut out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** So, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:23]** Just one more thing from that was... So Rolu handed off something to Hears.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** He did.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Describe that a little bit and what we've seen from that in Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:30]** Okay.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:33]** So yeah, Rolu hands to Hears.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** He's like...

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:55]** uh he's like this will help you get back in uh and here's doesn't really yet know what it is but it's he and nor nor does the listener here's knows a little bit more but we can't we haven't described to the listener exactly what it looks like but here's opens up this uh sort of puck-like thing that he's given and it glows blue when he like takes off uh some layers of cloth inside the package and

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:04]** And in Will Save, the main campaign, there have been moments where we've encountered pieces of, I forget what the material name is.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Does anyone remember?

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** There's some kind of material, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** I don't know that we ever got a material name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** I don't know if we have a name.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** We just called it the Artifact.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:22]** Yeah, there's some artifacts and things like artifacts that have popped up, and when what Rolu gave to here is near them, it starts to glow blue, so it has a reaction.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:30]** We've encountered that twice, I think, once on the Chimera, and then again, I believe, where we are now in the campaign.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** In the lab.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Yeah, in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Just very curious about that.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** But rest in peace, Rolu, at least once in your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:39 - 00:15:07]** or one reality um yeah what if there's like multiple rolus from like different dimensions i like um i shouldn't over complicate the timeline when we don't need to yet but when we when we run into weird issues like marvel does we'll start doing that yeah bleep that out john uh or vinny yeah um cool so let's go around real quick so that was rolu john you're rolu moving on um kelly who do you play

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** I play Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** No, not in Will Save.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** We're not playing Will Save anymore.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** This is my game now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** I'm sorry.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** This is Will Save, but you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** All right, who do I play?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** I play Thaddeus.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** He's that cat boy that you've been listening to.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** And he's...

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** He is the ship's weapons officer.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:31]** He's high-ranking, like Rollu, who's a Cobb.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** Although, I forget who outranks who.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** It depends on the circumstances.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** It depends on the circumstances, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** Yeah, but technically, you outrank me.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:45]** Technically, the officer always outranks the Cobb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** The weapons officer, Cobb.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** Yeah, he's...

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** He has a bit of a short fuse, and you'll learn more about him.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:55]** But yeah, he's a weapons officer.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** He's a big cat and quite a killer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** Vinny, you already mentioned that you are a plant monkey.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Plant monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Yeah.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** I play Check.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** He's a plant monkey.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** He's a Raxalite, but I'm sort of...

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:38]** sort of like how they do the upright bears I'm playing him sort of like that monkey thank you uplifted bears I'm playing him like the monkey from a certain very popular pirates franchise and he is a sort of really positive but ultimately a lackey for chief


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** I wonder, is that just common to Raxalites?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** I felt like Blicko was kind of the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** Yeah, I think as a race, they're just naturally positive and curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** They love sunlight, so they're just naturally bright.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** They're naturally bright.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** I like this headcanon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:53 - 00:17:01]** They've got a lot of... There's some canon canon that relates them to how bonobos are socially.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** That's cool.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:06]** They mean that they're, what's the word?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** I think bonobos are, they just choose one partner.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** What's the word for that?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** No, it's monogamous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** Monogamous is the term, but it's whatever the opposite of that is.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** I thought the bonobos weren't that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** I don't know anything about nature.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Also, my animal skills are quite low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** Well, there's actually a really good MapleTable video.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Shout out MapleTable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** Hey!

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Oh, nice.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Yeah.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** You'll have to throw that up in the link or put it on Twitter for us.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** I'll drop a link in the Discord.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:32]** Come see us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Sweet.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** And Will, last but not least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Yeah.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** I'm playing Termite in Hermidax.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:50]** And I am a witch word, which is a very weird warped race.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Pretty cool.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Yeah, they're pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:57]** They're actually on the cover of Drift Crisis, I believe.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Yeah, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** Has Drift Crisis come out at the time of this episode coming out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Because if it hasn't, we probably shouldn't say that.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** I'm pretty sure it has.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** I've only seen pictures of it on social media.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Yeah, we'll beep it up.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:15]** That's – yeah, we'll just bleep over some of it.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Which words are really cool?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:22]** Which words are cool and I'm – my class is a – oh, I shouldn't say my class.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** Yeah, I feel like we're keeping the classes.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Although I already revealed it earlier today.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Of course you didn't.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** I bleeped it.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** You bleeped it.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** And so, yeah, just put that back in post.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Cool.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:46]** My role on the ship in this crew is the yeoman.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** Yeoman?

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Is that correct, Kev?

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Yes.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Am I getting that correctly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** You're actually the yeoman chief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Yeoman chief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Yep.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** Which is one of the higher ranking in the enlisted branches.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Yes.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Enlisted side of the branch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** And I handle...

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:27]** I handle the paperwork, the finances, the transfers, the disbursements, and probably, you know, maybe I get sent in to negotiate a little bit or, you know, haggle with suppliers, you know, that sort of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Grunt work.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Air quotes, document.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:31]** Document.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** I need you to go document this scene for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** I'm a little bit of a grifter.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Yeah, cool.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** All right, so let me go ahead.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** One last thing.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** No, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:49]** I wanted to say, I don't think I mentioned, it's important, Rolu is Kasathan.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** So forearms, also like the witch word, also forearms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:02]** And if you study your alien archives, Kasathans are the...

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:08]** Genetic descendant of which words?

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:14]** Yeah, which words are progenitors of Shabbat and Kasathans.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Yeah.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:20]** And to your question, Kevin, about from Adari, I will just say that –

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:25]** The Adari was not the only way that some Kasathans got to the Pact Worlds.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** Okay, so let's roll into this.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** I'll do a quick rundown of... Last time.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Yeah, last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** Unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** All right, so let me just recap.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:48]** Your captain, Almanzo Goldhorn, which is, he's a gold-horned... Noir.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** Steaming noir.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** He was steaming because the room was cold.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** He's bovine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:53 - 00:21:06]** He sent the four of you down to Akiton, specifically to Kafak Depot, with the only instructions being, eliminate Dotrulu, find the riddle, draw him out.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:16]** Um, you make it to Akitan, uh, landing in Maro after your shuttle pilot tells you, uh, Hey, just let you know, like nothing can fly in Kafak Depot.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** Like we don't, is that a myth of some sort?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** Is that a rumor or is that like reality?

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** That's we'll get to that.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:34]** Uh, and then you get onto a, a treaded bus with armaments on it and you, you go to and through the city of Kafak Depot, um, dodging the 11 foot, uh,

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:58]** eight inch bridge and you end up right up next to the arena with this giant projection of that weekend's matchup between Frog and Cookie Cutter after snooping around a little bit you are pointed to Junkers Delight and on the way down an alleyway you find two red skinned humans and a Yosuke kicking another Yosuke while she's down

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:08]** I'm just going to read exactly what I read to you last time about what you guys see, and then we'll get into it.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Here we go.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:14]** At the far end of the short digi alley.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Sorry, that was a stupid voice.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:20]** At the far end of the short digi alley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** That was a cool voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Do it.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:32]** A pair of humans with bright red skin clad in leather jackets stand over a prone Yosuke woman to whom they deliver a series of kicks and punches.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:39]** She cries out in pain with every blow, while Yusuke, wearing the similar garb to the human, sneers.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:49]** You know the consequences for refusing Mr. Jatrulu's generous offer, Riddle, the standing Yusuke says.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Really, you brought this on yourself?

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:58]** The Hilki, nearest you, looks up and says, Hey!

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** You there.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** This is none of your business.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** Why don't you skedaddle before you find yourself missing some teeth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:10]** Do you always spend your free time beating up on innocents?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** This is none of your business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Keep on walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:21]** Rolo's going to turn and look at the three of you and just nod.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** And his hand's going to go down to his weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:36]** I think what my friend's trying to say is there's a way to peacefully resolve this where, well, we can all just go about our day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:43]** Yeah, the best peaceful way to do this is for you to walk away now before we beat the crap out of you.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:50]** And the Yosuke kicks the other Yosuke one last time and says, we'll be back to you in a minute.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** And they all turn and look at you.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** I just shared something with you on Roll20.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Roll20!

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:02]** It's actually beautiful artwork straight from Joker's Delight handbook.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:02]** It's beautiful work.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** That's awesome.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** All the artwork in Starfinder is amazing.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:10]** But while we're at that, I'm going to move you guys over to the map.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** To the map?

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** What's happening on the map, Kev?

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** I had a feeling about this.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** This is a big deal for me.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** This is the first time.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** This is huge.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Okay, so...

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** What do we do, Kev?

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Does anybody want to describe the scene a little bit?

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** No?

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** You guys are good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:32]** Yeah, but I'm so... There is a narrow alleyway that is... We are at one end of it at a sort of T-junction.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:44]** And behind... Well, I should say in front of us is a group of what appears to be three individuals and a...

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** battered, I guess, on the ground, Yasoki.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Oh, and one of them just moved towards us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** Yeah, that's the Hilki.

**[00:24:54 - 00:25:01]** And so just for you guys to know, Hilkis are what they call the native humans to Akitan.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** Okay.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:09]** They have the same attributes as humans, like mechanically, but they've lived on Akitan their entire existence, and so their skin has a reddish hue to them.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** That's cool.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** It gets deeper into it.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** There's actually...

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** Like five subclasses of Hilkies.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** But let's just leave it at that.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** They're Akatonian natives.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:29]** And that one is going to step up closer to you guys as his conversation is happening.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:37]** And as he steps up, you can see that he has a T under his eye that kind of drags down into the middle of a W.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Is that his kill count or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:44]** It's just tattooed on his left cheek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** I didn't know you were part of Time Warner Cable.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** You're late for your appointment.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** Don't you have some cable to install somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** Any time between June and January.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** I've sat off.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** Can we do a culture check on the TW?

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Yeah.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:14]** Could I know through my mercantile or business contacts or the underworld?

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Same.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Roll is going to do the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** I'll let you guys roll it, and I'm going to tell you the DC is a little high on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** I do get minus five if it's underworld because of my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** If it's under rolled because of what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** No, underworld.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** Yeah, and I get a minus five too from my theme as well.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** Hold on, I got to double check.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** I don't want to speak at a school.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** If it's related to business or commercial organizations.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Okay.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** John, tell me you rolled a natural 20.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** I rolled a 17.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** I rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** Thank you, Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Beautiful.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** So I actually – I'll let you in on a secret.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:57]** I had that TC made up a minute ago for – I said 18 in my head.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** I was like, yeah, they'll never get that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** So we both passed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:06]** So you know that T is – it is a T and a W, and the T stands for true.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** True.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** And the W stands for warrior.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Warrior.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:16]** What you do know is that there is a criminal element to these guys.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** They are a part of a gang called the True Warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Okay.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** I would never have guessed.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** And that's kind of the most I'm going to give you for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:29]** Do we know what the True Warriors are like?

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Are they interplanetary?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** Do they live in Queens, New York?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** They are a gang.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Okay.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** You do know that they are mostly located on Akitan.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:53]** I think the largest population of True Warriors, at least in modern time, was in Maro, which is the city you guys came from when you landed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Gotcha.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** So we're talking like organized crime, not a bunch of hardscrabble kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Yeah.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** Okay, so they are like, they're mobsters, not...

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** Warriors from Coney Island?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** I was hoping one of you guys would be like, Warriors!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Warriors!

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Come out and play!

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** No, these are the real warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** The true, the true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** Sorry, true warriors.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Come out and play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** Does your boss like that terrible attempt at a tattoo?

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** I think the last thing that happened was you put your hand on your gun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yes.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:42]** One of his upper left arm goes back to the hilt of a long arm that you can see that's hanging over his back.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:49]** And as that happens, he says, You know, I've seen your kind before, and there's only two ways that this ends.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** You're walking out of this alley,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:00]** You don't want to tangle with something your bosses might object to, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:07]** I think my bosses are going to object to letting you guys see the latter day.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:14]** And as he says that, he draws out his baton and swings it at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** He throws it from across ten feet away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** I'm so excited to say this for real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:34]** Real quick, just Thaddeus shout.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:38]** I mean, just as a weapons officer, Thaddeus shouts, my turn, Cobb.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Weapons out.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Spelts ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** Amazing.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Shouts to the group.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Amazing.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** First time rolling the Anish.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** I'll take the boy up front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** All right.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Go ahead.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Tell me what you guys got.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Who's going first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** Check with a six.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** With a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** That was a visual six.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** I saw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** It was a visual six.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Seven from Will.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** Yes.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Kelly got an I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** He looks confused.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Got a 13.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** 13?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Okay.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Okay.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** And Rolly got a 21.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** 21?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** I mean, it fits, too, because you had your hand on your weapon already.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** But I do want to say it wasn't drawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** It wasn't drawn because Rolo's not going to go there unless they do it first.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** But he knows these type of people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Okay, let me sort this range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** Well, he took out a baton.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** He did.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** He brought a baton to a gunfight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** He brought a baton to a gunfight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Oh, he sorted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:52 - 00:31:15]** that the wrong way can i also say real quick that uh that the artwork here is really cool like the the map itself is kind of like uh penciled in and it's a neat effect that i think jives and aligns really well yeah i'm telling you man starfinder has some of the best artists yeah you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** This is a cool map.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** Thank you to everyone who puts your pen to paper or digital marker to screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** It fits really well with just Akiton as a whole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** I love it.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Anyways.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** All right.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** So getting into it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Rolu, you go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Rolu goes first.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:49]** So I think the first thing is that Rolu is going to look over at Tormeid and just kind of just look and like meet eye contact and just say, I knew it was going to turn out this way as he draws the long arm.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** And I am in the back.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Can I occupy the same square as check?

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** I can.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** Wait, I just want to check.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** Are you small or tiny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** I was actually just, I'm tiny.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** I'm a tiny plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:11]** Because a small character takes up five feet of space, but a tiny character takes up two and a half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Two and a half feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:24]** And so I actually, for the listeners, if you're on a traditional map and your puck takes or your token takes up one square, Jack actually takes up a quarter of the square.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** And so you can stand and occupy the same space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Nice.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Nice.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Okay.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Well, here's the thing, though.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:42]** If I was pulling out my weapon, and what's my base attack bonus right now at level one?

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** I don't think I can move and pull my weapon at the same time.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** What is your base attack?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I was just about to look at that.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** I don't actually have that up.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Failing.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Failure.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:08]** But what I want to do is pull out the weapon and then shoot at the one that the Hilkey that pulled out their baton.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:12]** like they were thinking they were going to do actual damage here.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** So I actually might just do that since Chak is tiny.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** I might just do that from the square that I'm in.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:35]** I'm going to pull out this weapon that is honestly almost oversized for this alley, but just immediately, I think, gives the sense to this Hilki, hopefully, that he is in the sights and is definitely outgunned and outmatched where he's at.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:40]** And Rulu's going to just immediately take a shot at the Hilki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:45]** So that's a move and a standard action to draw your weapon and shoot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** I'm not going to move.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** I'm just going to stay in the same spot.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** But yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:54]** And you're shooting at the Hilki closest to you, so you do have a line of sight on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Yep, yep.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:02]** Right in front of this car, there's this cool artwork of this car and some trash and small debris in the alleyway, which is awesome.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:16]** So I think as you see Rolu's arm go up, the sleeve kind of comes down, and you see more of the tattoos of the Idari, and you see the, like, very...

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:25]** thin, muscular arm pull out and then just level immediately with no hesitation at this point.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Fool.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:35]** And that's going to be, as I pull off a round from this awesome rifle, that is going to be a 13 to hit.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** A 13 to hit?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:46]** Yeah, and it's cool because you see the front of the gun, and it looks a little bit like a serpent right at the muzzle.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** And so it's like the serpent is firing this bright green laser shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Does it hit?

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** K-A-C or E-A-C?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** That's probably going to be E-A-C because it's a laser.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** That's a hit.

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** That's a hit.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Sweet.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Sweet.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Okay.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Now I got to go dig in.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** I'm taking forever with my turn.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** I apologize.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:20]** It's going to be four points of damage to the Hilkie as the sound of this green laser shot hits their skin, crackling, burning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** I feel like the sound is pew, pew.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Cool.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** All right.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Well, that's your turn, right?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** That's the end of it?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Are you done, John?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Can I move on?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** Yes, you can.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** All right.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:44]** So as you do that, the Yosuke gives one last kick to the other Yosuke on the ground, and then he is going to move up and behind this.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** It's actually like one of those electric boxes.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** that you see kind of on a street corner.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Okay, yep.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:58]** And he's going to kind of crouch down a little bit behind that, and he's going to take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** Sorry, this yellow thing or this gray thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** This yellow thing.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** That gray thing is an awning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** Okay, yeah, so just for the listeners, you know, we are all— There's a gray box.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:17]** Yeah, like the alley is like 10 feet, and they are probably 20 to 30 feet away, but there's this yellow electrical box and then this awning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** So as he does that, he is going to take out his pulse caster pistol.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Nope, sorry.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** That was the wrong one.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Nice.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** And he is going to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** What happens when he shoots?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:42]** I can just picture him, like, kicking and scurrying and then, like, aiming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Oh, so close.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** So close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** It's a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Who are you shooting at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:47 - 00:37:07]** i am shooting at uh rolu oh man good luck behind uh thaddeus because i'm all the way back there i got some no i got a lot of fun on you because you take corner to corner as long as it doesn't pass through anybody else's square right uh which corner are we looking at here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:13]** You take one corner of yours and you go to all four corners of the other or something like that.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** As long as you don't, I forget what it is now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:17]** I definitely think you're passing through some people to get to my corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:21]** I got a 19 on the dice and a plus four on top of that.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** So I definitely hit you, John.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Oh, did you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** I was so close to that natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Did you hit me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:33]** If you say your AC is up there, I'm going to be furious and I'm going to audit every last one of you.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** That would be KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** My KAC is 15.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** So the max, I don't think I have full cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** So does a 23 with whatever your covers are hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** You probably have like soft cover.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Yeah, which is fine.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Yes, you hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:54]** We should screenshot this and figure out which one John has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** I know.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** No, I'll go look up it.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Anyways.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:04]** Okay, so that hits, and that is going to be a 1d6 of piercing damage.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Dang, dude.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Chill out, man.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Bro.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Dude, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** A 5 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** A 5 on the die.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Wow.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Wow.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:19]** Let me just go for the first time and deduct some of my stamina from my character.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** This is wild.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Take all of your stamina.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Dude, get out of here.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Hey, don't look at my hero lab.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** You're not allowed to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** All right.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** Moving on to the next person is Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Thaddeus.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** We can fire from cover without penalty, right?

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** As long as it's our cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** We can fire from cover without penalty.

**[00:38:41 - 00:39:02]** yeah cool am i gonna squish like uh are you undercover i don't where are you no i'm not i'm not gonna squish um uh jack no you can occupy the same squares as sweet because he's a small are you gonna squish jack please i don't know it looks like i purposely step on sorry shack um

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:13]** All right, so Thaddeus licks his lips in joy and then just takes this poison sort of charge and shoves it into his rifle.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:20]** This is a formian venom caster, and it injects a poison as well as damage.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** And so he's going to fire at the really particularly annoying vocal one who came up and talked with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** And then that's a...

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:39]** 3d8 poison uh nose strategy yeah he's a weapons officer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** That's 3d8 of poisons?

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Yeah.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Dude.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** 3d8 plus poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Huh?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** There's 3d8?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** I can do advanced weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** I'm a soldier.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** I'm a soldier, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Is there, like, a wolf save?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** Dude, what?

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** You're just saying your class all willy-nilly?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Like, it doesn't matter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Well, you have to know now.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** I mean, I'll at least understand these advanced weapons out of the gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Man, I really should have checked your guys' characters beforehand.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** So, wait.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** First, you have to roll to hit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Huh?

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Too late.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Yeah, I got to roll to hit.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Alright, so.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** It's just a 20, isn't it?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Good lord.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** It's only been a little bit already.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** I'm kind of forgetting.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Okay.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Wait.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** One second, please.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Okay.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Huh?

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Waiting.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** Waiting.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Pardon.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Waiting.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Okay, here we go.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Got it.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Rolling.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Alright, sweet.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Ah, f***.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** 10 to hit.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Is that KAC or EAC?

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** It should be KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** And then it's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Oh, rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:46]** So explain to me what your weapon is so I can look this up and make sure it's... All right, it's a Formian Venom Caster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** Like, Formian from, like, Ender's Game?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** That's cool.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** I don't know.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** Advanced, and it's a...

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Yeah, that's what it is.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** F-O-R-M-I-A-N.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** Did I give you guys a limit on money for this?

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Yeah, standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** It just makes sense that he would have fucking badass weapons.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Come on.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** What are you going to do with Thaddeus, Kevin?

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** This is 1d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** No, he has the advanced one.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** It's 3d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** I don't know if I...

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** Okay, moving on, since you missed anyways.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** It's now his turn.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Wait, it's whose turn?

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** It's the Hilki that you just shot at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Oh, the one in front.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** The one that's going down first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Yeah, so he's already got his baton out, so he's going to take a step forward.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Good luck.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** That's my step forward.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Stupid baton.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** And he is going to swing and hit at Thaddeus.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:46]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** John, do you got your card deck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** That was for critical failures, is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Yeah, there's a critical fumble deck.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** Oh, did he fumble?

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Did that happen?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** First combat fumble?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Yeah.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** The old FCF classic.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Wow, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:15]** Since it's the first, we'll do the card deck for this one, right?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** Because we only do it for named characters or we do it for everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Ready?

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** Three, two, one.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** Okay.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** It's a baton, right?

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** So it's a physical attack.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Uh-huh.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Ooh.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** It's called That Has a Kick.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** You take 1d4 bludgeoning damage per your weapon's item level.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** How does that happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Okay.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** I think it's a level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Yeah, so you probably take a d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** But wait, do you also take that?

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** No, no.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** You take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Okay.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:53]** So he's going to step up and swing real hard and just completely miss you and kind of lose control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** He just like hits on the car that he's hiding behind and hits him back in the face.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** Yeah.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** He's right off.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:05]** He hits the hood and the hood comes up and hits him in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** Now he's embarrassed and pissed off and he takes three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** That was hilarious.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:15]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Thaddeus says that.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** That was hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** That's now the other Hilkey's turn.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** Okay.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:27]** And he is going to step up and pass through that Hilkey, and now he's kind of in the middle of all of you.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:33]** And he's going to step in there and swing his baton backwards at Thaddeus, kind of backhanded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** Dude, Thaddeus taking all the blows here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:43]** It's a 7 plus 6 for 13 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** It does not hit.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Thaddeus laughs again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:54]** Tell me what your K8... It's 27, Kevin.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** 27, of course.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** John made these characters for you.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** Hey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** These are actually just creatures we pulled from John's adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** Yeah.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Level six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Yeah, so we start at level 20, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Yeah, no, you're supposed to be level one.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Go back and fix yourselves.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** I thought this was supposed to be a cakewalk.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** It's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Yes.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:25]** I'm seeing these foes right up in our face.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:35]** I am a little alarmed, and I am going to cast a cantrip known as Psychokinetic Shove.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** That is cool.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:46]** A targeted creature takes one damage with a force description unless it succeeds at a reflex saving throw.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** Creature takes that damage is also subjected to a bull rush.

**[00:44:51 - 00:45:00]** Tempt the bull rush combat maneuver using your caster level plus key ability score modifier as your attack bonus.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:04]** Push your target no more than five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** You are adjacent, so Bull Rush, you don't have any kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Yeah.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** You said a reflex save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** Yes.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** DC 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** He has... I'm going to Lemon Law this, maybe.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** I don't know if I like this or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Yeah, so... Well, he rolled a 10 on his reflex.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Okay, so he failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** We'll talk about Lemon Law later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Dude, he failed?

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** !


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** So you move back five feet and you take one damage, I think.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** What happens if there's two people in line?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** I don't know.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** Kev, you're the GM.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** I'm sure like you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** You're the GM.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** What would happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** What they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** I have too much on my plate.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I don't know what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Well done, Yeoman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** I bet they also take attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Not as a first round action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** For moving out of the squid when they get pushed back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** It's not first round.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** It's if you've taken an action in the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Well, I haven't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** They haven't, but we have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You two have.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** But it would only be an AOO if you have a melee weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Alright, there's no such thing as a ranged AOO.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** I have a melee weapon as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** If an obstacle is in the way...

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** Sorry.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** The target stops at the obstacle.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** So the obstacle being the other... Okay, I'm lemon-lawing this then.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** Forget that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** No, I think you had a great opportunity.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** You still get to do the attack, so... Okay, what happened?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** You take one point of damage.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** You take one point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** Oh, is it in addition to Bull Rush?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** I'm trying to read this again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Yeah.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** So Bull Rush...

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:55]** A bull rush says you knock the target back five feet plus five feet for every five by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the KAC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Oh, that's a lot.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Yeah.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** I got a roll like basically perfect.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Okay.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** For now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** No, I think it's still good.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:09]** So he takes one point of damage, and... I also think... I don't like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:16]** I think flavor-wise, it's cool that, like, it's not technically a pull rush, but maybe they, like, kind of stumble back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** So mechanically... Yeah, he definitely gets knocked into the other Hilki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Yeah, which is awesome.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Who's, like, pushes him back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** Yeah, but they're both, like, a little overwhelmed at this point.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Yeah.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:28]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Jack, it's now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:34]** I wish I had the... It did roll at 19.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Wow.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** That's good, yeah.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** I don't know if that... What's the KAC plus 8?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Oh, man, make me look stuff up.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** I just put it away.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Oh, KAC plus 8 would be 20.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** But isn't it with my attack bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** It said with your... You're the one with it.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** It says spell bonus and something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:53 - 00:48:04]** Uh, so what is your attack bonus to that spell or your spells, like spell bonus, whatever that says.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** Uh, I feel like Rolu is like talking to you in the corner.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** It says like caster level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** I don't know if that means anything or doesn't, doesn't level be one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** It would be the spell level.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** I think of what it says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Okay.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:20]** So it says your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Using your caster level.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:26]** So my key ability score is my, I believe it's my charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** Which is plus three.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** So 19 plus three?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** So I think I would get the full effect of the bulrush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Yeah, but it'd still stop at the hilkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Right.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Doesn't move back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** I think it's still a great move.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** It would have definitely been useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** I hate this spell.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** That's why the Lemon Law is there.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** I actually think it's really cool right now.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:56]** Because you hit a combat maneuver KAC plus 8 the first time that you use it.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:01]** And combat maneuvers in Starfinder are... And they failed to reflex save.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Yeah.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:06]** So, yes, does a lot depend on it, but you pulled it off on the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:11]** I think in all the 69 episodes of We'll Save, I have never... We've never hit a KAC plus 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** One of the NPCs did on the Chimera.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** I think to push somebody back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Do they weigh a lot?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** I'm getting rid of this spell.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Stay tuned.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:32]** To that point, to anybody who is new to Will Save, we do have a rule by which...

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:56]** essentially you can lemon law when you are you've just leveled up you can lemon law either some sort of spell or some feat that you've taken i think it's what it's within one episode we did one combat yes one combat or two episodes if there's like hasn't been a combat right so just something to help you you know if you're like this wasn't as cool then that's fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** I mean, yeah, that's up to you.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** I'm not going to, I'll let you do it, but like, I think it's a cool move.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Let's move on to Chuck.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:06]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** Tell us what's next.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:14]** To wrap up discussion on that, a bull rush moved out of one of our threat scores.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** Would it provoke an attack of opportunity?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Oh.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:22]** Since you are moving out via anything other than a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:27]** Oh, you're saying you guys would get an attack of opportunity on... Well, Thaddeus would, if he has a melee weapon out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yes.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** He does, but not equipped, yeah.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Right.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Yep.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:36]** So, I'm having a really hard time with this, because check.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Oh, you know what?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** He does...

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:53]** Sorry, I had to redo his build quite a few times because he's a tiny creature and miniature weapons and stuff costs twice as much as anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Yeah, so that was fun.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:07]** He's got a... What are we going to do?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** You know what?

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Fine.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** I'm going to make an unarmed strike.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** I'm going to make an unarmed strike against the guy right next to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:25]** He's going to... He looks way up at him because he's only like 18 inches tall.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** You made a mistake, Mr...

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** He lashes out with...

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Sorry, I thought it was a one.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** It's a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** Nice.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** I thought that you were going to critically fail on your first roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** I did too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Your first attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** So that's a five to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Oh, because you have a seven minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** That's definitely a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:59]** So your little vine whips just go and smack off his leather armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Cleans off some dust.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** It's actually better polished now than it was before.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** You, like, see yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** And then I'm going to take a guarded step over yonder.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Over thither.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** I've got to remember the keyboard shortcut.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Cool.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Hold alt to drag your thing.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Not locked to a square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Yep.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** And that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** All right.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** And that brings us to the end of round one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Dang.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** What a first round.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Moving on.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Round number two.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Rolu, you're at the top.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** Round two.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Rolu's at the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Feel free to do any spells right now.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** That'd be great.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Which of these...

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:53]** Which of these Hilkies look more... The one that I was shooting is the one that is 10 feet away from me, right?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** Is behind another... Is behind the one in front of me?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:01]** I think that same... Just for the listener, they're now clustered at the end of the street.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:02]** Yeah.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:10]** The four players, three of them are kind of in an L shape, and then Chuck can occupy a square, is in with...

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:18]** Rolu currently, and then the two Hilkis have kind of filled in the rest of that L up next to between the buildings and a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:33]** So I think Rolu was taken a little off guard by this Yasuki who just aimed and shot because Rolu was so focused on that Hilki.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** And so I think you see...

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:45]** Rolu's, his, his, his like trigger finger loosen a little bit.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:53]** And then his lower two arms just come together and his fingers interclasp and he closes his eyes.

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:02]** And the Hilki that he was the first talking to, the one that talked back, that Hilki, Rolu just dies.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:09]** And tries to summon the sense of the fact that he isn't where he is right now.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** He isn't in this time.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** He isn't in this place.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:21]** And he just pictures and just sees this Hilkey's head hitting the sand of the street.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:30]** in Akiton here and his eyes closing for the final time and then he projects that into the Hilkey's mind and cast Injury Echo.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** What?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** And that Hilkey needs to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Will save!

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Will save!

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** DC 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Making me open the book again.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:44]** Okay.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:51]** First off, since that is a spell, does it say anything about not taking attack of opportunities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** No.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** So the one in front of me will get an AOL.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** And that happens first.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** So let's roll my attack of opportunity.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Good luck.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** He just sees you doing this and is like, what the hell?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** And swings the baton at your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** Yeah, sees me closing my eyes and is like, dude, perfect opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** That's a 15 on the die for a total of 21 to hit KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Dude, that hits.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Dang.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:23]** And that is going to be 1d4 plus 3.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Oh, you're lucky.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** I rolled a one.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** So four points of damage.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Four points of damage, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Bops you right in the forehead.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** You need to calm down.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Also, technically, does that mean that I don't cast the spell?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** Or do I need to make a caster level check?

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** Maybe.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** I don't know.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** I think I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Attack of opportunity.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:52]** When the opponent in a space you threaten casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, you can use your attack of opportunity.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** However, some spells or spell-like abilities can confirm

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** that the enemy has provoked your reaction, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Oh, here it is.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Found it.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Very simple.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:11]** If you're casting a spell and you take damage from either a successful attack that targeted your AC or from an effect that you fail the saving throw against, the spell fails.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** That's it.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Okay.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** Page 331 of the CRB.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** So that's it.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:30]** So as Rulu's concentrating and seeing this, and as he's summoning this time and place that is not his own, and he tries to project that forward, he just gets this hit on his temple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** No, I wasn't thinking temple.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I was thinking right in the middle of the eyes.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** Right in the... And that was enough to shake you.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Yeah, I'm like...

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** All right.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:41]** So then that is now the end of your turn.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Yes.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:48]** The Yosuke warrior is a true warrior behind this electric box is going to take a shot.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** He's actually going to move over one.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:56]** And since you casted a spell, he's going to take aim at you.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** Ralu.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Ralu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:10]** 14 plus 4 for 20, but then he gets a minus 4 because it's soft cover.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** I don't think it's soft cover at this point.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:16]** There are two people in front of me, and there's a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** So it's full cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** I feel like it's full cover.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** What does everyone else think?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** I could see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Yeah, I feel like there's a full cover.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** There's tons of people in front of him from every angle plus a car.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** Yeah, I feel like it's a solid cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Are Yosuke's medium creatures or small creatures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** They are small creatures.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** Ooh, I would argue it's improved cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Yeah.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I could see that.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** It's a small rat behind a car behind two medium humans.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:48]** I don't know if he has a giant cat and a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** And a car.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** I would say it's improved cover.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** I feel like you guys are just throwing stuff down my throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** I think Thaddeus, being a combat-oriented person, agrees.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** Therefore, you should listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:07]** And Thaddeus, as we've identified, is technically the highest ranking here in the alley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** That's right.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** I'm just saying we have the high ground.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:21]** So that would just increase my... And it was against EAC, right?

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Or no, it was against KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** It was against KAC, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** I don't know if I'm going to give that to you.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Really?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** I feel like he's shooting from around this box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** Dude, but he's a small creature.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Okay, Kevin, let's review.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:45]** He's behind a giant box, which he has to reach over, and then there are two of his comrades, and then there's a car, and then me, and then way back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** And then Rolo.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** And the Yosuke is small.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** So it's like three feet off the ground.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** It's crazy.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** I'm a damn GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** I say what I want.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** You get soft cover and that's it.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** That's fair.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** Soft cover?

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** Until I get to read this entire page of cover.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** What is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:00]** And understand it.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:01]** It's Kev.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** It's Kev's world and we're just living in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Be reasonable.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** Okay, wait.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** I rolled 18 on the die.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** All right.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** You're saying you get a plus eight to fucking cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:38]** why am I getting bad you are 20 feet away and 10 of that feet is people you're ranting already 10 of that feet is people dude 10 of that feet is people and you're 20 feet away but hey you're the GM so if you want to say soft cover I'll just resent you for it no f*** it he shoots at nothing move on next turn oh my god I'm done with the show I'm not coming back ever again

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** That was his last episode.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** That was it.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** Dude, if you want to do soft cover, dude, soft cover.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** It's truly your decision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:51]** We're going to put a screenshot up, though, and discuss it with the lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** No, definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:57]** Yeah, we should have a mechanism whereby they can vote to overrule or something like that, I feel.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:57]** That's true.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Okay.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** All right, I guess it's Thad's turn.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:08]** So Thaddeus just says to Rolo, he's like, are you nice and comfy in your cute little corner, Cobb?

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:15]** And then he just takes out his gun and, as before, shoots at this villain right in front of him.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** The first guy, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** You're talking about the one closest to you to the left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** As you do so, the other one takes an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** Even though... Wait, why?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** Just because I'm shooting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** Yeah.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:36]** And the other one didn't take an attack of opportunity because he's already taken it on Rolu.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** Right.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** 14 on the die, plus 6.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** So that's 20 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Dude, they are rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Oh, that hits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** Okay, and that is going to be 1d6.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Nope, sorry.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]** 1d4 plus 3.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]** So that's 6 points of damage.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** So as soon as you raise your gun, this guy just swings his baton up.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Got it.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:11]** So now, I don't think that stops you from taking the range attack, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Right.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** It's not like a spell.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** You can still fire.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** You just take the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** Well... Okay.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Hold on.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** It's a ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** It's improved, improvised cover.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** 13.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:29]** Plus 8.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** Kevin, I'm just playing by the rules, dude.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** That's it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:37]** I know, and I don't have enough time to read everything there and understand what's going on.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:40]** Sorry, 13 to hit against who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** The one right in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** The one right in front of you?

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** Sorry, say it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** The one right in front of me.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** He's 13 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** No, you're 13.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Okay, so 13 to hit right in front.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Thank goodness.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** All right.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Did you sink his battleship?

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Sounds kind of... Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** Wait, this is the 3d8 thing.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** I don't know if I'm going to let you do that.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Yeah, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:09]** Can we talk about this?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** What is this called again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** It's an advanced what?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** It's a formian venom caster, which my class can wield.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** So I will be.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Formian?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** I tried not to go too generous on these weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** So here is the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** And I'm wondering about it with my weapon.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** Oh, it's a level nine weapon.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Yeah.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:31]** The level of the weapon means that you can't use it.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:39]** So I'll let you use the tactical Venom Caster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** Make sure you get your refund in UPB.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:45]** Wait, you can use a level three if you're level one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** I think you can go up to two levels above you or some rule like that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:52]** I truly want to look at what this is right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:59]** But just for time's sake, I'll let you get one D8 of damage, not three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Okay, fine.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** It's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Five points of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Yeah.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** I'll give that to you.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** This thing is like... And he's poisoned.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** 12,000 credits.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Dude, yeah.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** How did you afford a 12,000 credit thing?

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** We don't have a credit cap.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** We didn't discuss this.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:22]** I just figured that the guy who was the weapons officer would have a good weapon.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Just one good weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** I should have checked you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Kelly, dude.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** Dude, it's always 1,000, dude.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** I didn't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** Is your KZ actually 27?

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Because we really got to talk then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]** No, you wouldn't have hit me.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** No, no, no.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:38]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** I'm joking about that.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:44]** Webs pulled up to the shop with a blank check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:44]** Yeah, truly.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** I'm the Webs.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** It makes sense.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Anyway, all right.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** He's poisoned as well.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** It's role play, guys.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** It's role play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:54]** That guy takes a shot straight to the chest from point-blank range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** These guys are pissed.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** And is poisoned.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** Please add the poison track to him.

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Oh, and he's poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** Which poison track?

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** I don't know.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Apparently I don't know some things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:11]** I think it's like a roll of 1d4 on his next turn.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** I will read into that in a little bit.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:16]** But until then, he is going to roll to hit Thaddeus.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:18]** Of course.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Of course he is.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:27]** And that is 18 on the die with a plus 6 to hit for 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:30]** Yeah, that hits, so what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** Of course that hits.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** Yeah, it does.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:43]** And so this Hilkie, right after he hits you once while you're swinging, and then that other Hilkie gets shot in the chest, and then this guy just rears back, and he swings, and he's going to hit you right in the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:46]** So why are the NPCs so powerful?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]** Dude, these level one is pretty crazy.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Those look ridiculous.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** All right, so what's going on, Kevin?

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** Just do it.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** He hits you in the head?

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:59]** And that's our game.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** No!

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:00]** Yes!

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Dude, wow.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** Come on.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** Wow.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** Solid ending.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** Well played, kid.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Solid ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:14]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:19]** Until next week, drift beacons are distant stars.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** Oh!
