**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** I'm Kevin, your GM.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:02]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** We're getting deep into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:04]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:06]** Real deep.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:06]** So deep.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** Here we go.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:09]** Our eggplant has gone real deep.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Plum deep.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** What?

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:12]** No.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:14]** Never mind.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Inside joke, not good for a podcast.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Actually, really great.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** Great for a podcast.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** Everyone says it.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** We're plums deep.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** We're plums deep in this situation.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Plums deep.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** We're going to pull out real quick, though.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:29]** I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:36]** What the hell was that huge eruption from the engine, Kev?

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Can you just tell?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Kev, I didn't get to that part in the book yet.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** So just tell us what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** I'll recap all that a little bit.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Yeah.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** We can talk about that once we're in the game.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:52]** But I was trying to steer us this last time, and you guys made sure to make sure that didn't happen.

**[00:01:53 - 00:02:17]** made sure to make sure i think i think we've we've made it our mission to thwart whoever is the gm yeah in whatever their endeavors are yeah not limited to the game but i really want you to put on your role play cap role play caps today because we're going to go back to the war room of the caduceus what wait really we didn't i had no warning about this at all


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** Wait, impromptu?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Well, we do that all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Impromptu, improvisations.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** That's right.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Let's do it.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:27]** There are cameras, lights, and sound equipment all set up inside that wardroom.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:37]** It's a very familiar scene because you guys have each been in that room several times, except this time the bowl on the table only has saltine crackers in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:40]** Why do the snacks get worse and worse and worse, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** There is a stack of luggage in the corner.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** Like a pile of different suitcases and bags and stuff.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:55]** This film crew has been on board for over two weeks, which is why the snacks get worse and worse.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** From experience...

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** the good stuff goes first and you get stuck with the bad stuff over time.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:08]** Um, but two weeks is a long time underway and now they're going to be getting off at Absalon station during your resupply.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Um,

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:15]** But by this time, I think the film crew is actually very familiar with the ship's crew.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** They've been there for two weeks.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** They're starting to mingle.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:25]** So the film team is actually out there on the mess decks laughing it up and playing cards with a Dramada and a couple of human pirates.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** I thought this was cool.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** Let me just show you what a Dramada is.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:35]** I was just looking at random creatures from Starfinder, and this one was hilarious.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Show to the players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** It's like Scooby-Doo in a spacesuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** It looks like a weird snail camel.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** It looks so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** It actually kind of looks like Jar Jar Binks a little bit.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** It has the eyes of a gunman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Yeah, the eyes are like up on a tin egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** It's a... Mesa be in your documentary, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Me say here too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** Dude, if he's the big bad, if he's the big bad, I would be very impressed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** All right, Kevin, I'm just saying.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Oh, this is the big bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Sith Jar Jar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:11]** Turns out he's the big bad for all of Threefold Conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Yeah.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** Wait, his name, this one's name is Opacok Azifruth.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Opacok Azifruth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Yeah, and I'll be honest, I pulled the picture from somewhere on the internet.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:29]** Again, I didn't look up the artist or anything from that, but I think this one was actually from... So that name might be associated with some game somewhere.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I tried to search it, but I didn't find it.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** But, yeah.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Anyways...

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Okay.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** So these guys are just playing cards out on the, on the best deck.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:48]** Um, and, uh, the, the director, he kind of steps out of the ward room and says, Hey, Hey, we, we only got, we got to get a few more shots before we get off this thing.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** Like, let's go.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Come on.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** And such roundup his fellow crew.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** Um, then he's going to turn to Cobb.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Who's also sitting on the mess deck.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** We're on break drinking coffee.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** And he said, you want to, you want to be the first this time?


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** Sorry, I must have not read it.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** I'm just trying to keep my energy up here with this coffee.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** Sorry.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** The first four, what?

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Which questions again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** We're doing the last round of questions.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** I swear this is going to be the last time.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** So you guys will just come in one at a time and we'll try to get what we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Sure.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** If you want me first, then sure.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Let me just hold on.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:31]** And so the cameraman and the sound guy get up and make their way towards the wardroom.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:35]** Ralu, you kind of come into the water room, shut the door behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** Sorry, is there a table that I can put the coffee on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** A big green table in the middle.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** That's kind of tasteful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** Sorry, I said table.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** I meant coaster.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Is there a coaster?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Thank you.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** It's actually a hover coaster.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** It kind of floats there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Is it heated?

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Does it keep his coffee warm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** It's got a temperature gauge on it.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** You can adjust it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:05]** Yeah, there's a company called Ember Burn that makes these with the heated element.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** Goldhorn sprung for it because it's Goldhorn.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Anyway, if you want some coffee, let me know.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** I can get some for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** Caduceus is actually sponsored by them.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:16]** It's got Ember Burn sprayed along the outside of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:26]** It sits on the top like the signs of cars that are... Goldhorn's doing like ad spots for him on the road.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, he's doing ad spots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That's why you never see him.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** He's busy as fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** When I drink my coffee, I always keep it nice and warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** His contract actually dictates that they leave five to 10 at each heist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** Yeah.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** Our calling card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** It's like one of those small planes that, uh, toes assigned behind it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** Yes.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Anyways.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** So you sit down in that chair and the director's guy sits opposite of you.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** The camera's on you.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** The lights are bright.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Um, all right.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** So last question before we leave, um,

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** what's in your future?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** Uh, are you going to retire?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Do you think you're gonna retire as like a pirate captain?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Like what are your ambitions?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** Where are you going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** When you say what's in your future?

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** Roll his eyes.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** We're just looking unfocused in the coffee cup.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:30]** But when you say that his eyes look at you and there's this, there's a brief hesitation and it looks back.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** It's a great question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:38]** I think in my short term, you know, I've been with the ship now for

**[00:07:40 - 00:08:09]** gosh the better part of a close to a year a good amount of time so absolutely here with the caduceus and that's very important to support the crew you know longevity and commitment is i think what helps make a cob successful and appearing like a steady rock to their crew being there supporting them no matter what that's important to the job

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** long-term.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:13]** I don't know.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** And then the camera guy actually kind of speaks up from the back.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** I heard the next spot you guys are going to, like, something on Akitan?

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Is that true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** I don't know where you heard that, but likely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** Special waves hand to that guy.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** He's like, hey, shut up, dude.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** Like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Yeah.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Thanks.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Verola says kind of quietly to the director.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Do you have anything else for us?

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** This is the last recording, I swear.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:44]** So if you have anything else you want to add for our listeners, the show is It's a Pirate's Life.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** It's going to be coming on Absalom public television soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** Is this like a series?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Down Under.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** John, so, okay, roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:38]** Sorry, you asked if I... Sorry, I was thinking for a second there.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** You asked if there was anything else that I wanted to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:49]** Is there anything else you want to talk or tell about your life, about pirate life, about just the world to our listeners and our viewers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** About the world.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:00]** You know, it's probably better that I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** I understand.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Thank you again for your time.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:10]** And sorry, can I ask you, what have you learned personally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** I mean, this is our first ship that we've been on, but you guys live a very exciting life.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** I don't know if I could do it myself.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** Two weeks has been a little much.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I kind of like it.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** I think I might... Shut...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** No one asks you.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** I'm sorry, but no one.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** It's nice to meet you, and you've been great, Timothy.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** You've done probably the best that you could at this job.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Thank you, but no one asked you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** Sign me up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Sign me up.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** If you want to come on board, make sure it's not the Caduceus.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Thank you, Rolo.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:49]** You've honestly been the most courteous and helpful person on board, and I really appreciate it.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** And you're the one that gave us the first place.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Do you mind sending in one of the others?

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Possibly, like, I don't know, Treme or Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Sure, of course.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** And as Rolo walks past, Timothy, I was only joking.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** You've been great.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:09]** I mean, that night when we were sharing a bit of that brandy and just chatting, it's, you know.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** No, I get it.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** We're cool, right?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** All right, great.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Hey, Torme.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** Yes?

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Come on in.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** Last interview before they leave the ship.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Oh, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:27]** These parasites on board making a mess of everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** You say that, but it's actually really funny.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:35]** That's how submarine nerds treat visitors on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** Yeah, they're parasites.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** They are literal parasites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** They do nothing else to add to it.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** Hey, Termay, thanks for... Yes, very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** What is it now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Have a seat.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** I swear this is the last time we're going to ask you anything.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** We're getting off on the next stop, so if you have a seat, we'll get through the questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Right-o.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** So you sit down.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** The director sits back down.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Do I need a mic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** You got a lapel mic or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Oh, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Timothy, here you go.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Yeah, that's better.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** But, you know...

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** Try to be professional, I suppose.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** Don't want to have to reshoot this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:15]** Oh, I totally agree.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:15]** Thanks.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** I appreciate that.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:21]** Okay, so last question before we leave your ship.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** What is in your future?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** Are you going to retire as the pirate captain or something?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** What are your ambitions as a pirate or just in general?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:48]** Well, my ambition is to further the enterprise of this ship that I am in charge of as far as keeping the books and making sure we are profitable and harmonious endeavor.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:57]** But, you know, the vast possibilities of our future, really, it's our responsibility to ensure.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:04]** So I think what you're trying to say is, you know, what my aspirations are.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:09]** And I've told you to just make our ship more profitable.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:14]** We've got this new sponsorship you may have seen from these coasters recently.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:21]** We're trying to branch out into other things, diversify our portfolio, so to speak.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Oh, yeah, that's great.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:28]** Do you have anything specific you want to tell our viewers before you go?

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Any thoughts on your mind?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** Anything you want to just relay to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:44]** To the other viewers out there in the cosmos at Absalom... Whoever watches this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:54]** Whoever may be watching this, pirates are misunderstood and, well, it's...

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** I don't have anything to say other than I think we're largely misunderstood.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** We're just privateers.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:09]** We don't like government because we don't like to fund foreign wars on debt.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** And...

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** meddle in the affairs of foreign governments.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** It's just terrible, terrible business.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:21]** We'd rather just be private and be on our own and, you know, live and let live, so to speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Thank you, Tomei.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** We really do appreciate having us on board.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** If you wouldn't mind sitting in the webs, and then we'll be out of your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Sure thing.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:34]** Hey, Thaddeus, you...

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** You want to talk to these jokers?

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Get them off our ship, eh?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** Ah, the last interview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Yes, on my way.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** He kind of walks up the hall.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Oh, hey, Timothy.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Hey, how's it going?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Hey, how's it going, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** You guys have a secret handshake and everything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** We like this bump and stuff.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** I bring him in for the bro hug, and then I'm like, did you get that information on Roller that I asked you about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** I'm working on it.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** I'm trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** All right, good.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** And he hands him some M&Ms.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** These are a little bit better than the saltines you got going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:09]** And that's f***ing gold at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Good.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** He walks into the room.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** He's liked it to make it political again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Yeah, he started to.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** I mean, you know how he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Yeah.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** All right.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** So what do you want from me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** I swear, this is the last time.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** We're getting just our last shots.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** We're getting off to the next stop.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** We have one final question.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** What is in your future?

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** As a pirate, as a person, what are your ambitions?

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** Where do you see yourself in 15, 20 years?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:44]** Thaddeus leans back in his chair and kind of looks at the ceiling for a second, and then the chair comes forward.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** Sigh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** Well, this is my life.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** This is what I do.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** I get to do exactly what I'm good at.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** So I'm going to keep doing it.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:04]** And for the time being, and for the foreseeable future, I'm very happy to be a part of this crew in the capacity that I am.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:10]** However, I do, on the side, want to publish a cookbook I've been working on.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:17]** And then he passes you this thing bound just by clips.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** You know what I mean?

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** It kind of gives you a bit of a wink.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I understand that you have friends in the publishing business, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** I can see what I can do, but I want a signed copy.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Oh, yes.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Naturally.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** That's beautiful.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:36]** So do you see yourself... I'm learning how your guys' ranking works, but the Wepps is a middle-level officer.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** Do you see yourself advancing to possibly being the captain of your own ship someday?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:48]** Perhaps someday, but no matter what, I always like to be on the ground doing the actual work.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** So if I run a crew, Goldhorn is a great captain.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** But if I run a crew, just me being me, I'll do it a little bit differently.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** I'll just be involved more.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** But perhaps one day, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:09]** I've heard plenty of stories from the crew that Goldhorn in his old days used to be pretty rough and tough on the ground.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** That's a story for another time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** No, no, I've heard the stories and I believe them.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** And I've met other people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** He's pretty intimidating.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** We still can't get him on camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:22]** I say, when you just enter the room and the smoke just... I'm not even allowed near the room.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** We're not even allowed in that corridor.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** That's so funny.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** I wish that you got to interview him.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** I'll put it that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Maybe someday.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** Maybe you can work that for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** His schedule's very tight from what I hear.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** Oh, and if this helps sweeten the pot, he puts some Skittles in your direction.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** All right.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I'll talk to you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:52]** He takes the copy or the bounded copy of paper and he covers the Skittles with his hand as he slides the... Roll a sleight of hand check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** All right.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** What is this, prison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Yes, it's from my understanding.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Yeah.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:04]** Anyways, do you have anything else you want to say to our watchers, our viewers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Yes.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Yes, yes.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** Pirates can be many things, and it really is a motley crew.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:23]** We run into all sorts, but one thing that it always is for everyone, it is a place where you can fall into it and become part of a family.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:30]** And so if you are in a bad place, or if you come from an unprivileged background,

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** This could be a place where you could land and find purpose.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** And so I recommend that you give it some thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** I appreciate that.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** That was to everyone?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** Or was that to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** Timothy and I have gotten close.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** Yes, Timothy and anyone watching.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** And you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Interesting.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Thank you for that.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** It has been a pleasure being on board and we really thank you for your time.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:00]** If you don't mind sending in Chuck, you know, he's kind of elusive, but I think I saw him out there on cruise bus.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** I'll get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Chuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** Hello?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Hey, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** So you step outside and you don't actually see Chuck.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** That's because Chuck was in the room the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Thaddeus goes off to look for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:24]** Out of the table, you just see, like, leaves kind of, like, come up and around and then, like, pulls him out.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** Just under the table the entire time.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:27]** Hi, guys.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Hey, Chuck.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** You are, man, you always surprise me.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** You've heard all the conversation, right?

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:38]** You know we're doing one last... Yeah, heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Paid attention to some of it, you know.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** the mind wanders.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** All right.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** All right.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** If you wouldn't mind having a seat.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** And he like wiggles into a seat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** And then, uh, the saltine crackers are sitting there in front of you.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:54]** Nice and dry cameras on you.

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:00]** The director's looking at you and he says, Hey, last question before we get off, what's in your future?

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** Like, I'm not even sure your position is on the ship.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** I am assuming like personal assistant or something to the captain.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** But I was just curious.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** We want to know.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** We've talked about we've learned about your past.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** We've learned about what you do on board a little bit.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Where do you see yourself?

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:46]** in the future are you going to make yourself are you going to grow into be grow uh into a captain of a ship of your own or like what are your ambitions i love it oh man you're so funny uh i i don't know if it's funnier that or the idea of me captaining a ship i don't want that responsibility


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** I don't want troops or people.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:55]** You know, I've been feeling a bit cooped up in here, this big tin can that you guys have been living in.

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:01]** I think I might like to, you know, get to the ground, get some sand between my leaves.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** You know, just get out and explore a bit.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:09]** You know, you've asked what my task was.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** I'm basically a houseplant with legs.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:39]** i listen i come back i report i walk around i listen i come back i report it's it's the same thing you know i want some danger i want to feel like my life is threatened that's what everybody else likes his title on the cruise roster is just like ceo stateroom plant amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:39 - 00:22:08]** well thanks Chuck you're such an interesting person we really appreciate everything you've done for us and just having you tell us a little bit about yourself do you have anything else you want to just tell open time whatever you want to say to our listeners our viewers before you leave before we get off this show that's a big question I would say two things one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:18]** If you have a dream and it doesn't fit your given idea, go for it.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:25]** The other would be to tune into my Comedy Central special Friday night at 2 p.m.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** 2 p.m.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Absalom time.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** It's going to be great.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** If I get enough views, maybe I'll do another one.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** Who knows?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:10]** Uh, before you guys wrap up, I just wanted to add one more thing, you know, to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** You asked... You want to do it on camera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Why not?

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:18]** I just... I wanted to pose the question to your viewers.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:23]** You know, why did the space pirate steal the cargo of gold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** I'm not sure where this is going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:33]** To challenge the notion of value and the illusion of money and to reveal the underlying reality of power and exploitation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:50]** more pretentious roller or to me at this point i i don't know it's funny because like this he doesn't even like sit down to do this he kind of just puts his hands on the table and talks directly into the camera and that's what the show opens with

**[00:23:51 - 00:24:19]** finally airs like that's the first scene they start packing up everything you put the camera and lights away and and he's gonna go out to cruise mess and he goes over and he he grabs a coffee cup from the pile of coffee cups and he puts it underneath the coffee pot hey you getting some coffee too i i thought i might uh get a refill here let me let me pour some in for you you pour your coffee into his cup


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** Gross.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** It's a Kasothan tradition.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:30]** It allows you to breed familiarity and friendship.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** So don't worry.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** You'll enjoy it.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:36]** And then he tops it up with regular coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** Yeah.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:47]** Hey, I, you know, I, sorry, I was just so out of it just a few minutes ago, but I really had a minute to come to my senses.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:52]** Just, you know, I just want to say thanks again for coming on board.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** You know, you've been, you've been so great.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** I was very happy to bring you on board.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:01]** Again, I really wish you and your, your crew the best.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** You, I think, understand, like me, the importance of leading a crew and being responsible, right?

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Of course, yeah.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** Definitely not to the same degree that you have.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** I mean, we don't deal with life or death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** But yours is just as important.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:21]** You're affecting the minds of thousands, hundreds, millions, right?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:33]** That's actually where I – if you have just a minute, I wanted to ask, you know, remember how we were talking the other night about just different places that we've been and we talked about Berthita, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:47]** Well, I don't know if you know this, but on Berthita, there's a lot of Berthitan culture that Kasathans are interested in and vice versa.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** There tends to be a good share of information among academics and politicians and whatnot.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** And

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:07]** I just have to say that given the reach of your program, what I anticipate, and given the interest in Kasothans even now, I would like to avoid some of that spotlight.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** So perhaps you could just...

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:22]** I don't know what you do next with your audio and video in terms of editing, but maybe just shorten my screen time.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** That was a term that you used.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:26]** I'm trying to speak your parlance, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:29]** You want us to, like, minimize use of you at all?

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:34]** Or do you want... I could just send you the clips that we were going to use and get your approval if that's what you need.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** Just give me your email address.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** Nobody on the documentary crew would do that.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:46]** Nobody on the documentary crew that you worked with, but maybe this guy has a personal relationship with Rollo at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Sure, that would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** They shared a notion at one point.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** It was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:57]** Yeah, I think then I would really appreciate that, if there's anything.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:04]** And just in general, you know, maybe paint me as the nice, smiley, you know.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** I wouldn't expect anything else, Rollo.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Sure, of course.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Of course you wouldn't.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:09]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Well, again, thank you.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** And he pours the rest of his coffee in your cup.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** All right.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** I better be on my way.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** I have things to do.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** I'm sure that you do, too.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** You must be late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Yeah, we're packing up good enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:29]** This very sus moment about ROLU brought to you by... Who was our sponsor again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Ember Flame or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Ember Flame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Ember Burn.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** Ember Burn.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Ember Frost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** It's fake.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** It's fake.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** We don't have a real sponsor.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Come sponsor us.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Yeah.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** If you want us to talk about your product for 90 seconds in somebody's voice, we'll do it.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Keep it real.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** Kevin, I mean, sorry, Rollu trying to be relatable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:58]** The camera is going to kind of zoom in on the coffee and tilt upwards to look at the blackness inside of it.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:05]** And then we're going to pan back out of that blackness and see the three of you standing there.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** Jermaine, Thaddeus, and Rollu.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:12]** And as it zooms out even further, there's chalk on the floor.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** And it's going to pan around.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** and look at the drift drive that had just shattered.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** Last time, you struggled to understand your situation.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:28]** Drowning in darkness, you all convinced yourselves that moving forward was better than stepping away.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:39]** You each struggled to make your way back up and into the lab, while Tremé continued to play both sides by pummeling everyone with some Whizdwarper skill.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:45]** First, a sonic blast, and then knocking the gray and Thaddeus to the ground with some reversing gravity.

**[00:28:45 - 00:29:01]** You each made it into the room, and out of the magical darkness, after taking some of those hits from you, the gray makes it back to the computer, stands up, and hits a button, causing the drift drive to open up a doorway to the drift.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** It then shatters, leaving a cloud of drift particles.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** All right, I'm going to take you back to the map.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** Let me do this one thing real quick.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** I got to first take the throne off of her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** I have to close out of the... What was the name of the creature again?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** The Scooby-Doo camel that we saw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Oh, Dramada?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** Dramada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** The Scooby-Doo camel.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** Hashtag brand new sentence at once, and they're all good.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** I love him.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** I really want to play Dramada.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** They're so good.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Yeah, they look amazing.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Yeah.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:42]** All right, now to the more ominous picture behind that of this drift engine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:46]** That beam of purple shatters, leaving just a cloud of drift particles.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:58]** This sputtering cloud of plasma then morphs into a small, thin-bodied figure with a large, elongated head before turning to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Wait, what?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** There was a creature in the drift drive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:15]** The cloud that came from the drift merged and blended together and molded together to create almost a copy of the gray.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:25]** So now there's the gray setting off to the side and there's this glowing purple sparking version of her standing in the middle of where the drift drive was.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Not nice.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** I forget whose turn.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Who took the last shot?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** She did.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** It was her turn.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Termay, you're up.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** Can I roll?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** It was Rolly's turn.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Oh, no.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Did he move position or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:45]** I also forgot that while we're in here, every new round, I'm going to roll a D6.

**[00:30:45 - 00:31:00]** That's gonna determine the darkness level So a 1 to 2 will be dim light a 3 to 4 will be normal light and a 5 to 6 would be dark absolutely, but magical darkness or No actual darkness.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** So everybody best remain and I think that is you said you also have night vision.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** I have dark boots.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yes, I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:11]** Okay, so Tremay and Thaddeus will be able to see, but everybody else will have the blinded condition.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:16]** So after Tremay's turn, we're going to figure out how the lightning goes.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** So Tremay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:25]** Can I see, perceive, or talk to this thing in the glowing void?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** You can try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:32]** Uh, hey, hey, uh, Lord, what's this thing over here?

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** So you're talking to the gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Yeah, I'm talking to the gray.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** I'm talking at, I mean, I'm talking to the room, obviously.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:44]** And, uh, I would assume that the creature in this could also hear me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:52]** So you hear in your head, well, it's not exactly what I was trying to do, but it'll do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** And it's actually going to help me achieve what I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** What is it that you want?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Just this stone?

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** I'm trying to get Rolo to give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** Aye, you say that, and yet you throw me prone and attack me with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** I threw everyone prone.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:15]** But if you're going to make me an enemy, then, well, I suppose let's make it fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:21]** And Termay is going to throw an adamantine shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** Woo!

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** Woo!

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** Yeah.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:30]** At the gray or at the... So I think I can actually target two.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Let me double check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:38]** Do we have to target this purple gray being floating in the drift?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** I hope not, but I guess we do.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** No, it's a single target, I think.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** Okay.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** So I'm throwing it at the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** It's a severely delayed phase two of Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Oh, no.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** Chuck is perfectly positioned to take it up.

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** Aim for the chin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:04]** Does a 22 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Yes.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** All right.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** So it's how many shots?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Three?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** No, but what am I rolling?

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** D8.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:40]** you have to roll to hit each no no it's one roll to hit and i think oh no you're right you're right it is one so the first one is a 20 what did i say 22 whatever was it hit uh eight points on the first one max damage oh another 22 okay all right that was only four points

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** And that is 15.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** 15 does hit.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Two to make him.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** How much damage for the second one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** The second one was four.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Okay.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Very good.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** The last and final one was also four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** So 16 points total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Nice.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** That is the end of that round.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Did everybody do a fortitude save?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** We did that last time, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** No, we didn't.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** For what?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** It doesn't matter, though.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** It's just one damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Oh, right.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Everybody takes one point of damage.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** That's the last time we're going to do that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Yep.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Yeah.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** That's round three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Thanks.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** All right.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Moving into the next round.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** I now have to roll the d6 to determine...

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** It was a four.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** So I think we're normal lighting right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Normal.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** So we got normal vision.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** No concealments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Sweet.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Rolly, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** What is going on?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:51]** Literally, what is happening in this room of this, like, 300-year-old ship in the middle of junkyards in nowhere, Akiton, in Kefak Depot?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Some shit is happening.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:00]** And I am talking in order to buy time for myself so I figure out what I'm going to do.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** I mean, at this point, I think Rolu has to know.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** And he is going to step up five feet next to Chak.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:25]** And he is just going to look at this purple being and you see his face look with scrutiny at this gray and say, what is it that you are doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:31]** I was minding my own business until you stole my stone.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:36]** Hand it over, and you can leave, and we won't have any more issues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:42]** I don't think, after what you've done to us, that we can just let you leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** So be it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:52]** And I think Rolu is going to raise his rifle, and he's going to take a shot at the... Actually, at the purple thing first.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** At the purple thing.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** He's going to shoot his azimuth serpent laser.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Serpent laser.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:00]** That is going to be a 15 against EAC on this purple thing.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Does anything happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** It is a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** Shoon shoots right past it and hits the wall behind it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** That's my turn.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** It's your whole turn.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** It is now that creature's turn.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** So before it does anything...

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:36]** The purple-ish facsimile of the gray kind of molds into a strange core, again, of just cloud.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:48]** And then it starts to twist into a smooth, elongated head with the top of it extending backward far beyond the edge of its neck.

**[00:36:49 - 00:37:00]** And despite its nebular composition, the body forms with long forearms, four long skinny arms and a long slender body.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** And it appears to have a cloth across its face.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Similar to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Oh, okay.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** What the okay.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** What is this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** An orb of static electricity.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** leaves its chest, and slowly comes towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Towards Rulu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** And that's going to be 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:38]** That was a slow-moving ball, and I'm just watching it come near me, and then I'm like, oh, let me get out of the way.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** It just follows you.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** No, no.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** All right.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Evasive maneuvers.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** And it just drifts to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** Yeah, it's like... That is seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Wow.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Wow, okay.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:56]** Yeah, I kind of imagine that maybe it speeds up as it gets closer to me.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** It's like pulled in.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Wow.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Cool.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** All right.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I'm into hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:08]** It lifts up into the air and hovers about 10 feet off the ground.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** And that's the end of its turn.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:30]** Chuck doesn't like any possible bit of this, but also I'm going to roll a 50-50 D20 roll to see if he thinks that the gray is at the source or if... Actually, you know what?

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:35]** He thinks the computer is the source, and so he wants to take out the gray so he can hop in on that computer.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:45]** So he's going to move toward the gray, but sort of off to the left a bit so that he can get within range and fire two shots of his asphalt blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** At the gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** At the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Decisions are being made.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** 11 and 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** One hits and the other does not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Dope.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Four.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** D8.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** Four on the die, so five bludgeoning damage.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** All right.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Boom.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** Boom.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Caps it right in the shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** She kind of shakes it off.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:25]** Thaddeus is staying prone because who knows what Jermaine is going to do in his mind.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** And then he takes out his formium.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Well, it's already taken out.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:32]** He's aiming it at the gray and shooting him.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** What's the range on that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** It's 40 feet.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** That's not going to do it, is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:42]** You can still take a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Or will that do it?

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Let's see.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Oh, 45 feet.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** Yeah.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** Well, he crawls forward and takes the shot.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** So now he's within range.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Here we go.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:59]** It doesn't hit.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** It's a seven to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Seven does not hit.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** That's a beautiful turn, though.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** I love it.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** It is now the Grey's turn.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Give me one second here.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** I lost my page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Page lost.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Page lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Where did I put it?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** It's a reflex.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** I lost it.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Where'd it go?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Fortitude.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Give me a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Oh, great.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** My second worst one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** So the gray is going to step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** And then, yeah, give me a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Got a seven.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Super strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Beautiful.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** That's lovely.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:41]** So she steps forward one square, and her hand is kind of just pointed towards you.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** And you feel this grass kind of at your ankles.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** What?

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Give me the stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:58]** It's just a gray witch warbird.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** I felt the grass at my ankles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** Grasp with a P. Oh, grasp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Okay.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Yeah.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Yeah.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Define gravity.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Yeah.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Okay.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** That is Gray's turn.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Termay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:26]** Termay is going to say to the Gray and to this Gray specter in this cloud, you haven't told us anything about you and you keep attacking us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Forget you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** And he's going to do full round magic missile.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** It's his last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Are you expecting my whole life story?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** I wanted to negotiate.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** I wanted to at least barter.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Something would leave.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** Now you're going to leave with nothing but the dust off.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:49]** You're going to turn into dust.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** That's what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** So, Magic Missile, you're going to use all three?

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** You're doing a full round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah, a full round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** Are you going to use all three on the gray, or are you going to split it up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:01]** Yeah, well, he was the first dude to cross the line.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:09]** Unless this is a waste, you want to tell me, metagame Kev, that this guy's invulnerable while his specter is out?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Could I figure that out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** For the listener, I shrugged my shoulders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Can I do a perception?

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:22]** Can I learn anything about this magic?

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Can I do mysticism?

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** What are you trying to learn?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:33]** What is the mechanics going on here with this specter and this gray not really taking any of my damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** They took damage.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** I don't know what else you want to say.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:38]** I'm not going to tell you, oh, yes, they took so many points of damage.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Are they weakened?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** I'm not going to tell you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Can I do a mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Weakened is not a thing.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** There's no mechanic that weakens a character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Bloodied, I don't know, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** We've talked about this before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** Perception check or medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:59]** Can I do a recall knowledge on mysticism to see what is going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Sure.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** I'll give you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** And just to clarify, you're doing mysticism on what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** The phenomena that I am watching.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Yes.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:12]** I got a 22.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** 17 on a die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** All right.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** I'll give you that.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** I think mysticism fills it.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:21]** It is a drift phantom is the name.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** And a 25, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** 22.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** 22?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Okay, so I'll give you a couple of things.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** What do you want to know about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** What?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Just tell me two things, man.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** I don't know what to know.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** I don't know what I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:53]** I'll tell you, it has a fly ability, it's immune to bleed, critical hits, paralysis, poison, sleep, stunning, and it cannot be... Oh, and it has evasion.

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:04]** So if it were to pass a reflex save, it does not take any effects, even if it says have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:08]** If it doesn't take the fall, it doesn't take it at all.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Got it.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** Hey, do you guys know about this?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** What did you call it?

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Drift specter?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Drift phantom?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Phantom.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Phantom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** This is a drift phantom.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** It's pretty much immune to a lot of stuff.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** So, I don't know.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** Let's focus on maybe the gray first.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** This guy is just going to die.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Maybe this phantom will give up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:36]** Is it immune to energy damage or kinetic damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** I don't think so, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Anyways.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** All right.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** So, yeah, magic missile.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** First one's a three.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Second one's a three.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Four.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Four.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** So, 10.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** Nice.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Yeah.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** 10 to the gray.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Force damage.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Is the gray not dead at this point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Good lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Yeah, it's got some f***ing soak, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Dude, it's a tough creature.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** Well, he would have said that, wouldn't he?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:13]** Yeah, I think Kev would have said if it was looking like it's rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** I think you guys would have to perceive that.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** I'm not going to just give that.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I tried to.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** You did not roll a perception.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** You rolled a mysticism.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Do you want to roll a perception?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** I said roll a perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** I did.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** I just rolled a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** Okay, then you can see that she looks hurt, but she is not...

**[00:45:32 - 00:46:01]** weakened at any point she's not okay she's not like on her last breath but she's definitely not we're definitely doing some damage yes she's definitely taking damage yeah we can see that but i i couldn't order before you start oh god spell all my woo wee i gotta scroll back up see what that one is but it was a five on the dice which means that the room goes black

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:28]** perfect timing rolu uh you are now blinded what you and chalk both do not have night vision so you take the blinded condition okay we are we are sorry i i didn't know yeah okay cool thanks so blinded uh is just so you you're aware blinded gives you a minus four um penalty to most strength and dexterity checks you are flat footed uh you're

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** And let's see what else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Yes, yes, yes.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** I'm going to add it to my conditions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:40]** You have to pass a DC check if you want to go past half speed.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:51]** And you can't observe other creatures, which means that you treat all creatures as having a total concealment with a 50% miss chance if you attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** If I attack or cast a spell or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** I mean, I don't know if spells have a two hit.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** I think you would get 50%.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Okay.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** All right.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** It's my turn.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Damn.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** Yep.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** So I can't see anything.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:12]** Thaddeus and Torme can see something.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:23]** And Chak and Rolu are in pitch darkness, including... Do we see at all the Drift Phantom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** I'm going to say you might see the Drift Phantom...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Because it's casting light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** The glow, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Yeah, yeah, okay.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** But that's about it.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** But barely anything.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** So, I mean, I think he can maybe make out the gray.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:43]** And I think there's a part of Rolu that flips a switch.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:48]** And he realizes that he and the crew have gone from being...

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:56]** totally on the back foot in this situation to possibly maybe being on the front foot.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:05]** And I think that he is going to take advantage of the darkness, not knowing what this, what this gray has.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** And he's just probably tremendous.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:13]** That is could see, you see his face look up and he says, you have hurt us.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** You've scared us.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** And you know about this stone.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** You can't be trusted.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** And we'll find out whatever your evil machinations are and put them to an end.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:42]** And he closes his eyes and he just focuses on the length of time in his mind of time moving very quickly in this gray being in the room and pacing and moving and sleeping and working.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:46]** And then he starts to envision now past that time,

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:52]** like different deaths upon different deaths upon different deaths that this gray could have to accelerate their natural life cycle.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:58]** And he's going to cast death store on this gray.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:01]** You need to make a fortitude safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:05]** DC 14, 14 fortitude save.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** And you're casting this on the gray on the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** There is spell resistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** If that's a thing that you have, it's a 19 on the dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Okay.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** You're going to take half damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:23]** This is going to be have the damage and ignore the ability.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Okay, cool.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:27]** So you take fucking one damage from this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Good job, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** Yeah, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:36]** It was a very, very like... Really appreciate your support of my dice rolls that are random.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Right, yeah.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** I think it's a very visually stunning attack, but not that strong.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** I'm very...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Maybe there's just something going on with the energies of this drift.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** That's all the alternate realities that I am trying to envision.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** So that is the end of your turn.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** You're not going to move or anything?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** No.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Okay.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:01]** It is now the drift phantom's turn.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:13]** And before it takes its turn, this hovering, glowing copy of Rolu starts to flicker and shimmer.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:24]** uh before it changes and when it starts to settle it has a long slender torso and long limbs

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:50]** all covered in what looks like purple fur crackling with blue sparks its head and face is familiar cat-like appearance of a certain patch hold on a second could you describe the physical body again one more time not the face besides the fur a long slender torso no no no lips oh this muscular is sorry

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** But like pop shows in general, I have like a longer torso than they do arms.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** I'll send you a photo of Thaddeus for reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** A full fun.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Thank you for correcting me.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** Damn, I look good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** And with that, it is going to fly.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Let me just double check my... Oh yeah, okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** It flies across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Okay.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Wow, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Where is it coming?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** It looks like he's coming towards me.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** Please tell me this is not the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:42]** i have to click it first and then move it it's gonna move right to in front of oh all right that works wow great i don't know why it's not it's like offset for some reason anyways it moves right in front of rolu and then it is going to do a slam on the on the ground not on me

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** Oh, yeah, it's going to slam the ground and, like, below.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** It's like a thing that flying creatures do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** It's like the Hulk's gamma wave from Marvel vs. Capcom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:09]** So it's big purple misting arms, the buff ones from Thaddeus' figure come slamming down on top of you with a 24 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** Yeah, just against Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** It's just against Ralu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** And that is going to be eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Tasty.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Real good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:37]** As it hits you, the cloud kind of dissipates and reforms back into the shape of flying Thaddeus and sparks of blue lightning bolts and everything kind of flashing around a bit.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Chak, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:47]** Chalk is a hammer and he sees a nail over on this desk.

**[00:52:48 - 00:53:02]** And so he's going to scurry past this gray as much as he can up onto the desk and try to get into this computer to see what he can do to help the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** All right.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** So you... Which way did you run?

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** I missed it.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Did you pass through...

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Her space?

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** A threatened square?

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Or did you go out and around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** I envisioned Chak going straight, but I can... All right, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:24]** I'm just saying she gets an... Oh, she doesn't technically have a melee attack.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Oh, no.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** That sucks.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** So I'm going to actually give her an unarmed strike against you.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** You can't do it with unarmed strikes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** You can't do that.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** No.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** She has to have a melee weapon equipped to take an attack of opportunity.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** No cheating, Kevin.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** I would have to look it up.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** I don't remember.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** I would middle name you if I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:46]** All right, so she doesn't have an attack opportunity.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:46]** You get to the computer.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** You're going to do a hack.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** You're going to try to hack into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** I'm going to try to get access somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** You do a computer check on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** 20 on the die!

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** Let's go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** 26 is the total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** Because you kind of, like, whip over and slide into place.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:12]** And you grab all the monitors with your thing and adjust them to your height and, like, fold them down so you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** These ergonomics are important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Yeah, two screens there.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:22]** And on one screen, you kind of see a digital reformation or recreation area.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:45]** of the the drift drive and it's it's highlighted and different things are like glowing on it there's all these numbers associated with it on the other screen you see some instructions and you you manage to like click you know minimize minimize minimize on all these different things and you see uh finally a document that says it's like a word document and it says gateway

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** And there's some, some kind of, it's, it's not complete.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** And she, it actually has like notes that she's written to herself.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Like, I wish I could remember this.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** It's kind of what it says.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** And it has these coordinates, but they're not complete.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** Um, and that's, that's all you can kind of get from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:06]** So there's, there's a gateway somewhere.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** There's, there's a set of coordinates, but it's not a complete set of coordinates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Right.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Right.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:21]** Sorry, I'll let you finish because it sounded like you were going to... I was going to say, so it's basically... And you can... Like, from the computer's check, you understand that the gateway is the drift drive.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Like, the drift drive is not a drift drive.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** It is... It's being used as a gateway.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** It is almost like a mini drift beacon, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Cool.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Control-C, Alt-F4.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** You got to do it.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** Like, Chuck is trying to shut this motherfucker down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:55]** And as you start, you're like figuring all that out and you look over and you see kind of on the, where the model is of that drift drive, you see that some of the numbers look kind of like zeroed out.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:00]** Like they're all highlighted red and like it's broken.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:03]** You can see like the drift drive is not functioning the way it's supposed to.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** And so there's not actually a way to shut it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Cool.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Oh, okay.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Okay.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:22]** Thaddeus, like, saw the, like, body slam of, like, Void Thaddeus.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:23]** What was this?

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Drift Thaddeus.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:28]** And then, like, he kind of, like, makes, like, a smiling O face because that was very cathartic.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** However, he catches himself because this is not a good situation.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** And this cube that you've created here is enormous, Kevin.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Like, how big is this actually?

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** I need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** What cube?


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:42]** On my screen, it's like a cube of lightning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** A cube of lightning?

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** I don't see... It's like an area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** I'm not sure what you're seeing.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:54]** It's like 15 by 15 squares, so I don't know if I can shoot around it or what the cover is or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** So the lightning bolt is supposed to be just sparking around the drift.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Just pay attention to the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:09]** So, like, what we see is that square that I just drew, inside of that is black with blue lightning bolts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:17]** Do I actually get to see a void, a drift, Thaddeus, if we reset it?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Oh, okay.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** I see.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** There it is.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Gotcha.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** Much better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** All right.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** I was just trying to give you cool effects.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:22]** I'll delete them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:27]** Okay, well, he sees that's definitely in the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** So, like, to be clear, the purple lightning was correct.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** So, like, that had a transparency layer on it.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** The blue was a black square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** It all looked good on my screen.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:45]** It was just supposed to be purple and blue sparks around the phantom itself.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** But, like, the phantom is the important part.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** And it takes up five by five by five by five square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Okay, cool.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** Well, that's right in front of Thaddeus between him and the gray.

**[00:57:53 - 00:58:05]** So he's just going to like crawl on his belly between Rolu and Terme and be able to like attack the gray, which he will do from here.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** And here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** So you just crawled out of a threatened square.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yep.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:14]** And that does not count as a five foot like guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** Does it have an AO to attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** Does it have a melee weapon equipped?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Yeah, does it have a melee weapon to make an AOA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Yeah, it has a slam.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** It just slammed you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Okay.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:29]** Does it have a weapon to use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** That is the melee attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** Why would that not get... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** Cool.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Are you telling me I shouldn't do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:41]** No, I thought it was a melee weapon, but it's probably just a melee attack.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** So that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** So I'm going to roll...

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** That is a 23 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:54]** Uh... Oh, no, it doesn't hit.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** 23 doesn't hit you?

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** AC plus 4, so no.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:02]** Is it AC plus 4 for... It wouldn't matter what it is, it won't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** I thought melee attacks are different if you're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** Yeah, so ranged attacks... I fucked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:13]** So it's just normal AC for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** So it's even worse because it's like a negative four to melee attack rolls.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Oh, no, that's my own melee attack rolls.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** All right, cool.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Never mind.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** All right, cool.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Take damage and how much damage is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Yeah, fantastic.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** All right, cool.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** 11 damage taken.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** God dang it.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** All right, so then he's going to like fire.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** He's going to fire and hopefully this works.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Ouch.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** Good job, me, but ouch.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** It's a fucking six to hit.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** I'm so tired of weapons.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** I hate them.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** All right.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** I miss magic.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** I miss magic so much.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** I miss magic so much.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** I can't stand it.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** I keep missing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** I gave Chak your turn.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** I just did.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** That's your whole turn.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** It's now the Grey's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:09]** All right, so I want to figure out if we kill this gray, will that thing disappear?

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Is that a thing?

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Can I try to figure that out in some way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:15]** I'll let you roll a mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** I don't have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** I have perception.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** You can roll a perception.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:22]** It's not going to tell you anything about the connection between the creature.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** So a 24, you can see that the drift phantom is solid and doing very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** And what do I notice about the gray?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** It's pretty close to death, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:36]** You notice the gray is on the lower end of health.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** She is beaten, battered, but she is not near death yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** She's about halfway down, boys.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** And ouch, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]** Speaking of which, it is now her turn, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** We end on her turn.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:52]** I wanted to know more.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:02]** Wow, this is going to be... So it sounds like we have to kill this Drift fandom thing as well as the Greg.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** That's my concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:14]** Until next week, Drift begones on Distant Stars.
