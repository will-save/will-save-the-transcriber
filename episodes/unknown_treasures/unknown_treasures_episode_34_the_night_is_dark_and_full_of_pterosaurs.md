## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** All right, welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:04]** I'm Kevin Decker, your GM, and this is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:06]** Before we go any further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:09]** Treasures Unknown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:09]** Treasures Unknown.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:14]** I just want everybody to raise their hand if they've seen the movie The Godfather.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Listeners, whatever you're doing, raise your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** For the listener, Kelly is not.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Let it be known.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** I'm not raising my hand.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:23]** Everyone but Kelly is raising their hand.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** I haven't seen many very, very, very important landmark movies.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** Look what they did to my boy.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:37]** I was actually picturing like an entire auditorium of people and everybody's raising their hand except for one person in the middle is Kelly.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** He's just sitting with his arms down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:43]** I just pretend I'm from a foreign country and I don't even know what it is.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:47]** But isn't that the one where there's a dead horse head that wakes up?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Not wakes up, good lord.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** Someone wakes up next to a dead horse's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** That's a very different movie.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:56]** No, it's a Disney movie about a fairy godfather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Aw, that's really sweet.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Starring Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** Fairy godfather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's awesome.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I love that.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:14]** Who's come to save a young Mark Wahlberg from inner city antics in South Boston.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Because that's every Mark Wahlberg movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:19]** Leave the gun, take the cheeseburger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** I've only seen one Mark Wahlberg movie, but that was exactly what it was.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** And to rescue his family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** Is Mark Wahlberg in The Godfather?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** Where did Mark Wahlberg come from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** He's an extra.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** Yeah.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** That makes sense.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** I know.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** God, I don't know, man.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** I want to see it.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** I need to see that and then Heat and then...

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** What's that movie with Mel Gibson and Alan Rickman?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:48]** It's supposedly like a Christmas movie, but it's also just full of killing people.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Die Hard.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** What?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Die Hard.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** I haven't seen Die Hard.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** I've not seen Die Hard.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** That's not Mel Gibson.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Bruce Willis.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** What the fuck is Mel Gibson?

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** No, Mel Gibson and Alan Rickman.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Oh, God damn it.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** This is how little I know.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** I'm sorry.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** I figured it was Mel Gibson because every movie with Mel Gibson is just him killing British people.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** That's like every freaking thing he's doing.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Pretty accurate.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** He hates British people, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** He's not an action guy, though, for the most part.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Oh, God.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** He's got a lot of hate in his heart.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:23]** I think it's probably like the Lethal Weapon series.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** It's probably the closest thing to an action flick that he's been in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** No.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** I mean, Braveheart is pretty action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Patriot.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** I have beef with Lethal Weapon.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Not because of anything Lethal Weapon has done.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:42]** It lives in my brain right next to Rush Hour.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:49]** And so every time I turn on Lethal Weapon, I expect Chris Rock and Jackie Chan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** If it was anything like Rush Hour, I would watch it right now.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** But it's not, right?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** It's not.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** It's such a good movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** That is one of my favorite films of all time.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** I didn't even realize how much I love that film until just now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** Instead of watching all the other movies, I just watched that one like 20 times.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** It's so good, dude.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** It's such a great movie.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:09]** It's not Chris Rock.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:10]** Who is that?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Oh, Chris Tucker.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Chris Tucker, thank you.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** He's amazing.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** But then he didn't film anything else after that, unfortunately.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** He didn't have to.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** That's true.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** He did Fifth Element.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:36]** he was oh that's right he was the same kind of character and it was really funny though like i like yeah he's just it's chris tucker chris tucker plays chris tucker that's he's like uh yeah did you know i love that there's a rush hour four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:37 - 00:05:07]** already released it's probably I just learned that there's a Jason or a Friday the 13th 8 yeah there are too many of those it's like Jason in the Bronx or something I saw a clip and was like what movie is this from and I went to the comments and they were like somebody said it and I thought it was a joke they were like Friday the 13th part 8 Jason goes to Brooklyn and I was like haha that's funny and then I googled it and was like no that's a real movie is that just him becoming a hipster


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** That's what he does.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Wait, the bad guy, Jason, with, like, the ski mask or something?

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Yeah, no, he goes to Brooklyn and just kills a bunch of people.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:12]** Or, like, hockey masks.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** I don't know.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** I've never seen him.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** I feel like he would die in Brooklyn.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:22]** I actually recently found out today that, like, Philadelphia is, like, the city with, like, the craziest f***ing people in the world.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:28]** And apparently, like, after every sports victory or failure or whatever, they throw batteries at people.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** They're always, like, climbing up poles.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** Dude, you Philly people are crazy.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** You live in LA, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Like...

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** LA's done that too.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** And so has Chicago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:44]** I believe the bills mafia would like a word.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Who's the Bills mafia?

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:50]** The Buffalo Bills football fans.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** The craziest antics I've ever seen.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** I'm a Jaguars fan.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Loved the Jaguars my whole life.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** There's been a lot of suffering.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Please don't give me s*** about it.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** But 2017 was the best year of football in my lifetime.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:16]** Um, first game of the post season, we play the bills in Jacksonville and I got tickets to the game.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:24]** So I'm walking in and there's dudes like jumping off the top of RVs through folding tables, WWE style.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Like, okay, cool.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** I guess that's a Bills Mafia thing.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:35]** So like we win, which is a crazy outcome for any Jaguars fan.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** Craziest moment I've ever experienced in that stadium.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:45]** But after the game, they're like lighting fires in the parking lots in downtown Jacksonville.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** Nothing happens in downtown Jacksonville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** That is the most to have happened in the past two decades.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** No, it's Florida.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** It doesn't get cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Yeah, but they don't know that.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** They're from upstate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** They're from upstate.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** They're in shorts and t-shirts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** It was not cold.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** They were not lighting those fires for warmth.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** They were not lighting fires to efficiently get rid of trash.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:36]** uh it was like straight up riot status nobody expected the jacks to win that game um so yeah setting setting fire to downtown i think bill's mafia but it was the bills fans lighting the fires not not the jaguars fans no what is dude oh yeah i what are the jaguars fans do um we went out and got drunk we were so excited

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** We didn't know what to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** This is a unique experience for us.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** We've never been here before.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** You were, like, dignified in victory.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** Yeah, true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** Jags fans were going around putting the fires out after the Bills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:55]** That's the least Florida thing I expected, but I'm really happy.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** It's like the inverse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:01]** We all released our pet alligators, and they chased all the Bills fans out of town.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:09]** There's this mascot for the Philly hockey team, whatever they call it over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** The Flyers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Yeah, them.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** There's this mascot called... The Free?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** What's his name?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** Gritty?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** He looks like he did every single drug imaginable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** You Philly people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:28]** I'm with Kelly that Philly has the craziest fans.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:50]** from like every list that I could think of and everything that I've ever heard of through the grapevine I've heard that they have I mean apart from like you know actual you know world cup was a few weeks ago uh oh yeah true you know like soccer fans football but yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** I literally don't know.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** I would say Philly.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Philly takes the cake.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Apparently there's a story about like a really cute robot.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** They had like one for Canada and one for the United States.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** And I forget, I think his name was like Hitchbot.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** And then like he made all the way across Canada.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** He was a hitchhiking robot.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** It was really sweet looking.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** And then he was going across the United States, I think from like east to west.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** And he died on the outskirts of Philly.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** Like people just like destroyed it.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** He didn't even make it to the inner city.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** What is going on, man?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:47]** anyway i don't know anything about sports is all i know so i thought i would like excitedly talk about it so thanks for indulging me uh i'll have to like go to a game with one or all of you someday i think when you go you'll just know a lot of trivia about things and we'll all be like the mascots but i don't mess with just the raider nation of which i uh would probably rep oh okay i already so raiders yeah yeah it's always a disappointment


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:54]** Blippi shows aside, but Blippi went to a baseball stadium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** Sounds familiar, Blippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** And it was Diamondbacks Stadium.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** And I was really confused because the mascot for Diamondbacks is a snake.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:05]** But the, well, the emblem for the, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** The mascot is a bobcat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** And his name is Baxter Bobcat, D. Baxter for Diamondback.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** And I was like, why?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Clearly, it's a snake.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Diamondbacks are snakes.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Why would you not have a snake?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** But yeah.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Anyways, he explained it.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** It was because it's like Bob Stadium.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** It's something Bank Stadium.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Bank Stadium.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** I don't know.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** What stadium is it?

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** I forget.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I don't pay attention to baseball.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Arizona?

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** I don't know.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** Yeah, yeah, Diamondback Stadium.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Anyways, that's my story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** That's all I got for teams and sports stuff.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Is Blippi a mascot or is he like a kids' show thing?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:46]** Oh, man, we're getting into a whole different conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** Yeah, I can talk about Blippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Grayson loves it.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** My niece and nephews love Blippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** That's why I was saying push that aside and talk about the Bobcat.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** But, you know, let's just play games.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Let's.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Before we go.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** Okay, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** You'll have to cut this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** Now that you said cut, you can't cut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** No, this one you really have to because it's like the listen to link.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:15]** I don't know how to channel that audio into my headphones and not have it on my, just coming out of my speakers.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Do we know how to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Are you on your Mac?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Oh, wait, never mind.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** I think I answered my own question.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Aren't you a computer scientist?

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** I don't make computers.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** I make things with computers.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Thank you.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** Don't you work in IT?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** I hate it when people call me IT.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Yeah, you work in IT.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Hey, can you look at my printer for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** I will be useless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** What's the best computer that I should get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** God, I hate that question.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** What do you want to do, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** We already went through this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** It's fine.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** I just want to do normal stuff.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:56]** Yeah.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Classic answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Let's play World of Warcraft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:05]** It would be really nice to be able to edit an 8K video in no time at all and render it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:10]** Alright, we are going off the rails.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Off the rails.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Let's do it.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** It's too much banter.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** It's already been like 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** I can talk about rails, too, because Grayson has a whole train set that our neighbors gave us.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** What?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** Like three full boxes of train sets.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Thomas the Train, like the wooden ones.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** What gauge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** I don't know.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Like the ones from Ikea?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Yeah, there's like three different brands.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** They all use the same.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** They're usually like one inch wide.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** There's one inch?

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** I don't know, man.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** You want me to go measure it?

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Hold on.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Pause the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:47]** Does anyone know somebody who's really into trains and locomotives and has their own thing?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Oh, I forgot to say.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** Okay, Will and Kelly are raising their hands.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** Do you have sets at your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** No, no, no.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** I know people that do it.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** And when I lived overseas, there are people that just ride trains all the time back and forth.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** They're crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** That's so fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** They're called train otaku.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** I know people who have rideable trains.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** They're amazing.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** It's like, all right, cool.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** We should get to it.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Is there a train in this adventure?

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** I'll make note of this.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** We can talk about trains.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Put us back on the rails, Kevin.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Can we take a train out of Kefak Depot?

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Come on, conductor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** That's right, trains out of Kefak Depot.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** We're like, we're done with this.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Alright, seriously, let's play.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Okay.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** But before we get into that...

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Well, it's still game.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** We're playing now.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** It's game time.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** I'll change it.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** But I was going to ask, you guys leveled up last time.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** What were your level ups?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** You don't have to tell us anything.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** If you want to tell us something, let's just go around.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** What did you do for your level up?

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Me, I did a lot of prep to kill you guys at your next level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Oh, that's not surprising.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** I'm not surprised at all.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** No one's surprised by that.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** Even as GM and Kev's a murder bot.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:02]** Oh, maybe that's... Okay.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** That's the common denominator.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** It's not Rick19 that's the murder bot.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** No, it's Kevin for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** We established this.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** There's only one murder bot and it's the Tinkerton that you guys killed.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** You killed the murder bots.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** That makes you the murder bots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:20]** That Tinkerton looked a whole lot like Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** Kevin's feet are really big like a refrigerator, I've noticed.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** They just kind of stomp around all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Like Minecraft.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:33]** I think the highest Patreon goal, Kevin admits that he's a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** Wait, so is that like number of subscribers or something?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Or enough money a month?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Sure, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:45]** You'd have to pay me enough money directly to get me to a business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** No, man.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Support the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Come on, man.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** So, level ups.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** What did you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Oh, I'm stoked.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** So, John, what was that book you just added?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** Interstellar Species.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Interstellar Species.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** I love that book.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** It's so good.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** Added a feat for Raxalites.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** called Pinsirred Elfan.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** What?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:19]** So now Chuck has little crab claws on the end of his stalks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:28]** So practically speaking, he now has a melee weapon that's just like a natural weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** It's an unarmed strike, essentially?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:34]** It's an unarmed strike, but it's my operative weapon, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Oh, that's neat.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** What do you have?

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** You only have five foot reach on that though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** Correct.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** So like I can reach the next square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Yeah.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** I like it.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** That's that's that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Yeah, I'm stoked.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** So now I can have a tax of opportunity.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** It's really a club.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Part of the family now.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** You're part of the Bills Mafia now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** For those times that I decide to dive bomb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** Which will be happening knowing Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Oh yeah, easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:14]** I do like the mechanic that you added, Vinny, where you're just like, I'm just going to roll whether Shaq is going to do some crazy s***.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** I really like that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Made for some good storytelling.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:17]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Kelly, what did you do for your level up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:28]** Okay, I'm going to preface this by saying I really don't like being a person that is either melee slash shooting s***.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:50]** i want to be a caster again i did this because kevin said everyone else is a fucking caster more or less and we need a soldier and i well except shack i guess but i don't know he lied to me so i'm a soldier and i added this thing where hold on give me like i think i mentioned that there's no tank in the in the group is all i said like there's no front man

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** I don't like that.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** There's still no front man.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** I know.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:04]** It's not my personality to just like... I don't think a tank in Starfinder is really that big of a thing, to be honest.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:09]** I've seen Rick go to... Rick was our tank in the main campaign, and Rick went down a couple times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Didn't he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Yeah.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** He got close, so... Anyway...

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** You'll see what I have.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** I just have something that can help the group.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:21]** And I think of my... I can't find what I added, Kevin.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** So someone else go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** We'll come back to you.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:29]** Will, you look very studious right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:34]** Yeah, so I mean, I just took another level in Witchwarper.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:48]** And one of those things, I mean, there are a few things that come with that, but one thing that I did was I picked up a feat cultural chameleon, which I wanted to...

**[00:17:48 - 00:18:00]** Try out with the person that I'm standing guard with in my downtime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Okay.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** All right.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:15]** which is once per day after one D4 hours in a settlement, I get a DC 15 culture check to recall knowledge about local customs.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:26]** And then on a success, again, a plus two diplomacy on a change attitude for residents and other people in the area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** That's neat.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Interesting.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** John, you look really excited to tell yours.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Is that sarcasm?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** I'm just looking at the screen.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** All right, moving on.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Kelly, what do you got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:50]** I have this new feat called close combat, and it's when you hit an adjacent foe with a melee attack as long as you are adjacent to that target.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:59]** you can give a plus two circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks from other creatures that are not adjacent to you at the beginning of your next turn or whatever.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** And then, like, some... What else?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** I have weapon specialization for all of my class's weapons now.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** And, yeah...

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Yeah, armored advantage.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** It's like a gear boost.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** It's just like a plus one to KAC while I'm in armor, which I always am.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Just stuff like that.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Basic things.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** I don't like being a... I want to be a caster again.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** It's more fun.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Soon enough, we'll go right back.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** We'll drop you right back into Shirin's body.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Yeah.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:29]** But for now, you're a cat man and you're a soldier.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:31]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Come on, Shere Khan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:39]** So I also got weapon specialization for all of my proficiencies.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:44]** And I'm still trying to suss out.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** No, I'm still trying to understand the...

**[00:19:48 - 00:20:12]** the methodology behind precog i think obviously for this adventure i don't i don't think we're going to get too high in level uh this could be our last but i think precog really starts to hit its stride as you hit fourth and fifth level just from some of the readings on forums and like best builds and that's when you can start to really use the paradoxes per day to

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:38]** towards even more things that allow you to you know like pull something from the past or from the future and it's interesting though that they've given you a bunch of weapons like proficiencies and they they kind of rank you up a bit as a as a fighter like as a really aggressive combat uh and you can focus on you know small arms or uh long arms so it's like

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** I think they do that to balance out the fact that your paradoxes.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:52]** And although you can cast spells, it's not the same as being a techno answer or, uh, you know, so I, I'm still trying to figure it out, but obviously I got weapons specialization.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** And I got a few other things that you'll see as time goes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Sweet.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:02]** If you're a real precog, you would have known if we're going to level up again or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** I already know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** He just doesn't share because he's sus and he's rolu and he won't.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** He's hiding things as always.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** You don't know that I'm a precog.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** All right.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** That's true.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I probably don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** All right.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:23]** So last time you all thought you could pick a fight with the great Bomb Gozzle and you learned how wrong you actually were.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** He already took out that tiny little monkey plant.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** So then you try to talk yourself out of it.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:34]** But you killed Tinkerton and by triune, you had to pay for that.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:44]** And that's when that tall skinny guy, the one with the four arms, he took some big shots on Bomb Gozzle, put Bomb Gozzle so much stronger, and took him down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:50]** But that plant thing rose from the dead, and it dealt the final blow to Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:57]** And it turns out Bomb Gozzle is actually Warburg, Flip Pan, and Bomb Gozzle all inside a mech arm or something.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** Uh, anywho, that's when Bomb Gozzle saluted you, and we all followed suit.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:06]** But then, uh, oh, and that's because you're the Chosen Ones, and you're the Junk Lords.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** But then that four-armed freak kicked Bomb Gozzle over.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Why'd he do that?

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Why?

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** What the heck?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** That don't matter, though.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** Because the Great Wreckage is open now, and who's going to go in there first?

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Well, we can talk about that while we rest up.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** Uh, anyways, that's how I ended up here with you, Terme Ovden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Uh, hey...

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:34]** Tell me more about some of the local things that have been going on around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:42]** You mean like how we've been praising Triune since the dawn of time and that we got the great wreckage is open now?

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** It's open.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Look at it.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** We can just go right in.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** You want to go in there?

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** We have to wait for another one.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Let's just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:55]** I mean, we should wait for, you know, just in case we want to have a united front for our...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:22]** adventure and discovery of what's to come but like your nights mean I mean your friend kicked my friend that's all I'm saying and if your friend kicks my friend again I'm gonna kick him back hey you know I think we should just you know take a page out of the you know peace playbook and split a fuck dog what do you say

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** That sounds good.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** How much longer until watch is over?

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:30]** Let's go get a Kefak dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:41]** Yeah, I'm not sure how long the watch is, but I'm guessing it's at least, you know, some amount of 1D something amount of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:47]** So watch is probably about over and you actually hear rustling in the tent.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** Who is actually going to take the second watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** I guess Jack will take the second watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** So, so a light flicks on and it's just your chalk comes wandering out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Hey, hey, you're good.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:02]** Good.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Get some sleep, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:11]** Another goblin comes out of a different tent and kind of meets up with you and shakes hands with Zocket.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** And Zocket takes off and stretches.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:21]** I'm going to go sleep, so I'm prepared to enter the Great Wreckage.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** And they walk away.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** And then the next goblin has joined you, Chuck.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:33]** Which, surprisingly, the goblin is a little confused because they've never been next to somebody smaller than them.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** They're kind of amazed by that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** Chuck, Chuck, season perplexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Hi, I'm Chuck.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** I'm Chuck, the right side.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** I'm Tork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** Tork?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** Tork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** One word, like Madonna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Tork.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** Tork.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Tork.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Tork?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Like you dance?

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** I was thinking more like wrench, but torque, you know, because I torque things, I'm strong.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:06]** I'm like the second strongest goblin in camp.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Are you stronger than Palmcastle?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** No, Palmcastle's stronger.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** He's number one.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Tell you a secret?

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Palmcastle's not that strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** I didn't know that.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** What do you mean he's not that strong?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** I mean, I took him down.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** He can't be that strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:36]** Well, you took down the shell of Baumgasl, but like Baumgasl himself, maybe we should set up arm wrestle championship.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** You want to try?

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:37]** Let's try.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** We practice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** Checks tendrils start clicking.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:45]** He's excited by those blades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:50]** Yeah, let's not try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Okay.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Okay.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** You want to know something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** I want to know all the things.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** All the things.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Okay.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** So this is good.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** This is real good.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** And I'm a little afraid.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** I don't want to go in there first because the great wreckage, there's something in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Jack is like bouncing with excitement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:20]** So the rumor is that the great wreckage, that there's still the souls of the original crew trapped there.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:30]** And every few years, and just a note for everyone is that time on Akitan moves slower.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Not time.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Well, time is time.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:35]** But like a year on Akitan is actually twice as long as a standard year.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:43]** So every few years, they rise up and they try to fly the ship out.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** I heard it once when I was real little.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** The ship rumbled to life.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** It was heard all the way to Mars.

**[00:26:52 - 00:27:00]** And I remember we all gathered around, we watched it, and it shook, and it rocked, but it never left the ground.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** And then it went quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** And then Tinkerton came out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** No.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** No?

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** No.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** No?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Tinkerton came out.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** Tinkerton's kind of always been here for me.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** I'm definitely one of the younger ones, though.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** That sounds scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** I mean, you just kind of learn to live with it.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:33]** Why don't you roll me a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Eleven.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Sweet.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Sorry, I never took you back to the map.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Let me do that.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** My mouse is being silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:46]** Footnote on our hold screen that Tinkerton's eye is no longer glowing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** What?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** It's like you killed him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** It's like I shot him in the neck.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:58]** Oh, look at everyone all bunched up in their respective tents with the goblins.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** It's kind of good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Sorry, I forgot to do this earlier.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** I'm really bad about doing multiple things, but we take you back to the map.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** We're on the mid-zone.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:18]** There is the entry to the Stellar Flare, and off to the left-hand side of that, there are three sets of tents that have been set up, and everybody's inside of those.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** The Goblins, the Vari-13, your crew, some of Kestis.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:28]** Everybody is in there and sleeping, except for the two of you who are on watch right now.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** And so you rolled, what was that again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** 11.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** I mean, 42.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:41]** So you get the sense that you're being watched.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:48]** But all you see are shadows moving in the windy night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Did you feel that?

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** Was that a cold breeze in the desert?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Yeah, it gets cold here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:05]** But that felt like maybe we're being watched by all those souls.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** This is scary, Jack Shudders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** Yeah, I never felt that way, but you're right.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** I feel them too now.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:22]** I feel their eyes on me like their eyeballs are rubbing against my skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:25]** It's terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Please don't ever say that again.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:35]** Rubbing against my skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Check wretches and like some pollen comes out.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** Has anyone ever come out?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** Like on Halloween, do they come hand out treats?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** Um, what's, what's hollering again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Oh, I guess you don't have that here.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:01]** It's a, it's a holiday back on Absolute Station.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Oh.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:07]** You knock on a door and you say trick or treat and either they hand you goodies or you pull their pants down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:13]** Oh, that sounds amazing.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** So much fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Maybe we should try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** No one ever thought to knock on the doors here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** Should we knock?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I guess the door's open.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** We can't knock.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I guess the door's open.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** We can't knock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Wait, it's open, open?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Not open, open?

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Is it open, open?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** We're not supposed to go in there.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** I was told not to go in there.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Ah, but knocking isn't going in.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Knocking is knocking.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Okay.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Yeah, yeah, you first.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** No, you first.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Oh, I'm not going.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** I told you I'm not going.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** Can I roll a persuasion check?

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Uh, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Uh, persuasion is not in this list of skills.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Uh, what is it?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Diplomacy?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Diplomacy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Diplomacy?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** A bluff?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** It'd be a bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** 14.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** 14 both ways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** You were convincing, but no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** Okay, okay, cool.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Okay, I'll do it.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** Chuck ambles over and like knocks...

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:20]** ever so lightly on the door.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** Like barely audible to himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Tork is like watching you intently, but then like shooting eyes left and right.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Like, oh my God, we're going to get in so much trouble.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** Also, we might get eaten alive by something or the ghost might come and get us.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** He's got all sorts of thoughts running through his head.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** He's freaking out that you're doing this.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** So you knock on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Yeah.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** But he knocks, shaving a haircut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** And nothing happens.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** So now we pull down the pants?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** Well, you can't do it if they don't open the door.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** There's no one whose pants to pull down.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** If they open the door, they don't have treats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** What are you two doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:04]** We're talking about a holiday back on Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:10]** And so Anakesti actually wakes up from his tent and wanders out towards you.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Who is taking the third watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** Rolu.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:35]** I think Rolu is having very fitful sleep and decides to stay up, pushes open the tent flap.

**[00:32:37 - 00:33:05]** quietly takes a few steps forward into the sand in the night and there's just this flash of sound in his head and he stumbles a few steps and then stabilizes himself on the side of the stellar flare before turning the corner and seeing the Ikeshti standing out there Rolo stays, walks over and nods and then stands about

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Five feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Hello.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** Brother just pulls out his pad.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** Starts to look up at the stars and make some more drawings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** What you got going on there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:34]** Oh, uh... It's always been a... been a hobby of mine, too.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:38]** track the stars ever since I was young.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:46]** So, uh, helps refocus me.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:54]** Do you, do you ever tracked any, the movements of the celestial bodies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** Uh, I've never met a celestial.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Good point.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Good point.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Yeah.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** I'm not even sure what their bodies would look like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Yeah, definitely.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** That haunts me all the time.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Oh.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** So.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** All right.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** What's your name?

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** I'm Quartel.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Quartel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Yeah, Cordal.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Cordal, yes.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Like the game.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** Cordal.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** You don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:50]** Uh, you mean, you mean that game on the, the, the comm units that none of us have?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Yeah.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** I'm sure I went with a sudden accent all of a sudden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** You sound like you are from a different part of Akitan or maybe a different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:03]** I, I'm trying, trying to be in a cash stake.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** It's really hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** Are you, I, it's, uh,

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:21]** Pardon me for overstepping, but, you know, I am not your typical Kasathan, so perhaps you are not your typical Akashti, and we are both trying to fit into cultures which are not our own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Am I right?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** I mean, I'm an Akashti.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** I'm not sure what you're trying to imply there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Sure, yeah, of course.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** I don't know what I was trying to imply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** You know, speaking of Akastis...

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** We're the ones that have rightful claim to this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** What?

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** We sent two of our own spellcasters in there.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** They were able to teleport.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** And they got inside that force field.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Wow.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** And they... So it's like rightfully ours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** What did they see inside?

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** Broly folds his notebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** Well, they never came back out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:12]** Oh, that's an interesting... I wasn't expecting that outcome.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:26]** I understand this might be your right, but have you ever considered that the goblins have also spent many of their own time and blood trying to figure it out as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** Yeah, but they never got in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** And we did.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** It's ours.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** And as he's telling you this, he's starting to realize.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** There's a sadden.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** He's saddened by the revelation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:46]** Did you know any of these spellcasters personally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** No, not personally.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** But I heard about it.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Yeah.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** Yeah.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Brolu opens his notebook back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** And you look out at the stars.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** Go ahead and roll me a perception, Jack.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:08]** 16.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:16]** Okay, so far off in the distance, you see some large silhouettes.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** At least three of them.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** And they're moving slowly across the edge of the mid zone.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** Cordell, do you see that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** Oh, yeah, I think so.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** I'm not quite sure.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Should we get a closer look?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Yes, yes, yes, of course.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:41]** Willow puts away his pad and two of his hands pull out his rifle.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** And when you say in the distance on the map, you're talking south on the map, east?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** I just put them on the map.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Okay.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** They're the very south edge of the map.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:57]** And just as I said before, I stretched this map out a lot bigger than it was.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:04]** So if you have played this game or know the map, it's now about 60, 70 feet.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:08]** Probably a lot longer, 120 feet far instead of anyways.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** It's twice as long as it was before.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** 70 feet.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Hey, that was a good guess.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Yay.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:19]** So yeah, about 70 feet away in the darkness, you see three large shapes walking by you.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Do you want to get closer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** They look like pterodactyls.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** They do.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:30]** Rulu's going to look down his sight of his rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** But like the Bob Ross variant of pterodactyl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** In what sense?

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** Like big hair.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Oh, yeah, kind of fluffy and cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:50]** Cordell, I think it might be best to wake everyone else up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:58]** So in the scope of your rifle, you see a pterosaur.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Do you want to do a life science check on these things?

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** Actually, do I have life science?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** That I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Yeah, I don't.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** So I can't do a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** That's not good.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Yeah, it's disappointing.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Let me see.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Can I look?

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Yeah, yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:26]** Rolo walks forward next to Quirtle and hands him his rifle.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** A long arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Oh, those things.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** They, uh... They're just like lamb butts.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** I think they used to be able to fly, but they, uh...

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** I think they forgot.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Oh, are they?

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** We just kind of keep out of our way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Let's get down.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Let's crouch down.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** They seem dangerous.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Do you encounter them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:52]** I mean, we just let them by normally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** All right, well, then maybe we shouldn't wake anybody up.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** Let's just crouch.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Rolo's going to crouch down.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Try and stay out of sight.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Close to the ground.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** Just squirtle crouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** I mean, he's a small creature, so he ducks his head a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** That's fine.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:14]** Do I need to roll stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Do you want to do anything else?

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Are you attempting... Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Roll stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Yeah, Roll is going to try and... Yeah, that's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Okay, they don't see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Okay, I take the long arm back from Quirtle.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Does it look like they are coming our way, or are they just passing by?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** They are just moving along in the drift.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** But you do notice they have very large wings.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** They are pterosaurs.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:44]** They are real animals from Alien Archive 2.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** They are flying dinosaurs called pterosaurs.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** That's cool.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Except they're not flying.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** They're just kind of staggering along.

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:03]** And they move close to the tent, but I think you probably have your gun raised and you're watching, and they just keep walking.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** Move on.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** And I delete them from the map.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** They're gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** The end.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Well done, Quirtle.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Well done.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** That was close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Yeah, a real close one.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** I'm glad we didn't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** Yeah.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** Because you're a real one, Quirtle.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** I appreciate it.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:29]** And Rolo pulls out his notebook again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** Cordal's a little confused.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** He's a little off-put by, like, doesn't know what to say to you or what to do.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** So he kind of just turns and starts watching the other side.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** But that was a close call, because those birds would have really messed you up.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** It was a pretty awkward conversation between you and Cordal, I have to say.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** I should say Rollo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** I blame Rollo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** He's always trying to relate to people, but, you know.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Just can't quite get it.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** John's really good at it, though.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** It's just Rollo.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** I feel bad saying this about Rollo all the time.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** It's like, I feel really bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** I feel like you have a personal vendetta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:32]** almost like yeah all right anyway um i don't think what roland knows what to do either he's not he's not actively trying to grab a conversation anyway he he he feels off kilter you know like when you like when you're uncalibrated and you need to recalibrate you need to recenter


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Oh, yeah, because he's always trying to recenter.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:41]** Kevin, is the reason why he's with an Akeshi and not the goblins like the other guys is because the goblins hate rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** I actually didn't even think about that.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** The inside information was I just pulled the next one on the list.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** The goblins are like, nah, nah, nah.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** All the goblins are like, f*** rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:00]** This is when you can really tell that Kev's a first-time GM.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** Because me and John would have been like, yes, it was.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** That was totally planned.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Absolutely was intentional.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Yes, that was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:14]** Good eye there, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** I appreciate your honesty, though, Kevin.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** It's very unlike Rolu, who's always lying.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** Anyway, and in the spirit of that, Thaddeus is kind of waking up around this time.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:29]** And he does that cat stretch where he turns into a plank, as cats do.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** And then he kind of gets out of the tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Meow.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** He kind of stretches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:46]** And he, prior to Rolu, well, no, he's just kind of like, yeah, Rolu, I'm just getting up a little bit early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:52]** I figured you'd be dying from some really awkward conversation out here, so I thought I'd let you end your watch already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** You know, it's funny.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** You do know me pretty well.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** It's pretty impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** I just don't feel like I know you enough, but oh, well, I hope I do someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** I hope you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** And he's going to kind of like... Whoa.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Yeah, well, okay.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** I didn't hear that roar, but whatever.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:23]** And then he's going to kind of like move stealthily over to pretend he's going to go like pee or something like that.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** He's going to go behind the tent that's in the most northwest, which I think is the one that Shock is sleeping in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Just got to, you know...

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** What is it that you say, recenter myself?

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** I'm going to go over here and recenter myself for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** All right, I'll be here.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** As I'm sure Rulu is going to sleep soon, probably.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:59]** Thaddeus then is going to kind of sneak in a little bit into Terme's tent, which is next to the tent that Shock is in.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:05]** And he's going to kind of poke in and be like, Terme, wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Hey, listen.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** I'm sorry to wake you up.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** But, and I know you might not get a full rest.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Shh.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Just get out here for a second.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Let's talk outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** No need.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:35]** And he's going to use the mind circlet and just talk in his sleep like to Thaddeus outside.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:38 - 00:46:07]** yeah what do you want man just to I could talk to you like this in our mind what do you want smart idea Tremaine that's why I'm trusting you with yes I love that you said yes in Thaddeus yes as Thaddeus was like mumbling with Tremaine I think Jack stirs is there something outside


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** I feel like I should have had you guys do like stealth and perception checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** That's fair.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Let me roll perception.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** I like to let the dice tell the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** No, no, go for it.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Do what you're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** You hear Broly's voice as he starts to be like, so this, this constellation actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** Well, Jack is in a different tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:36]** Well, okay, to be fair, Thaddeus went in there with a flashlight and was like, to me, to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:44]** Hey, why are you guys just staring at each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** Treme has his eyes closed.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** He's in bed.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** He's not moved.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** He's not moved.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** He's got his arms crossed.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Let me try that again.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Get the fuck out of here, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:02]** Thaddeus, why are you staring at Treme intently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Intently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:17]** The leaves that Shaq has as eyebrows are just, like, all the way up at his hairline right now.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Shaq, come here, please.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** He climbs up on your shoulder.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** Perfect.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** Could you... Could Termay, like, talk to both of us?

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Is that a possibility, Termay?

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** With your lightsaber?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** I think what do you wanna just like get meaning?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** I don't know if it works like that.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:47]** I haven't tried it but Maybe if Kev will allow it if I allow what I think you can do a party line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:54]** I'm not sure how Sharon telepathy works Okay, Sharon's can talk to multiple people at the same time.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Yeah, I

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** If it's exactly like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:58]** Yeah, but then can the people hear each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:04]** You can telepathically communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with which you share a language.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** But you're right.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** I don't know if the two of them can then hear each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** You could just... F*** it.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:28]** all right to me honestly uh all right listen this is what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go outside the tent and i'll stay linked with you and he does this telepathically of course and i'll take shack out with me and relay what i'm about to say and what what you say to me all right this is super important what dude i'm

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** I'm trying to sleep, man, but okay, go ahead.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:37]** Thaddeus gets out of the tent and like wraps around the back and he sees like Rulu continuing to like die in the conversation.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** So he's confident that he's okay for now.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** So then he starts like talking to Treme.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:53]** He's like, Treme, I have strong evidence to suggest that Rulu may have been involved in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:22]** in that heist that he hears you remember that wanted poster that wanted hollow that he was involved in that in some way and I have a favor to ask you I find you trustworthy and I know you're on the side of the captain I need you when Roly was sleeping to go and see if there's anything on his person that might be a clue as to his activities with that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Are you saying any of this out loud?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:31]** He's going to tell... Depending on what happens next, he's going to tell Shaq something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:39]** I kind of feel like Thaddeus actually... The way he uses telepathy is the same way that people who read books out loud... He's using telepathy, but he's saying it out loud at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:50]** Well, I don't mind to try and investigate with you, but I don't want to...

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** I don't want to alienate Brolu just yet.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** We still have a mission to accomplish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** He won't know.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:08]** You're so good at selfily... You know that spell you have where you can just pull things out with your magic, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** Yeah, but I mean, my sleight of hand check's not that great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** All right, then.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Just a moment, please.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** And he starts to tell Shaq.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** Shaq.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** You're loyal to the captain, aren't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Right.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Well, for the sake of the captain, I have a request.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:42]** When Rulu is sleeping, I need you to go on his person, search him stealthily, and see if there's anything he's carrying that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:51]** that might connect him to some recent activities that have harmed the free captains.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** You know that.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:52]** Here's Hollow.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** I have strong evidence to suggest that he was involved in that.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** That's bad for us.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Bad for the captain.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Bad for you.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Will you do this for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Sure.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:06]** Am I looking for that thing he took from the captain's office?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Or the thing he took from Tickerton's head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:17]** If you took something from the captain's office, then I'd be very happy if you took that office person too.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:24]** But anything like perhaps a star map or something like that.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** Or some shirts.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Or some shirts.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** It might seem like something rather inconspicuous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Like concert merch?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Like what are we looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Yeah, maybe something like that.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** We'll save it.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:56]** you know like he has those really shitty drawings of like the sky and everything that too anything on him because it might seem inconspicuous but if you take it out I could observe to see if there might be anything else there it might be hiding something you know what I mean it's a tricky one okay sure all right excellent


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Go back to sleep, Tomei.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** I'll talk with you later.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:07]** Listen, I'm not trying to... I'm not trying to... I just... That's fine, Tomei.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** That's all right, man.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** You should go to sleep.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** We'll take care of it.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Just keep this between you and me.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:19]** Again, we don't want to upset the... We don't want to upset Rollo or alienate him, as you say, so we're going to keep it on the down low.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Just don't say anything, all right?

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Have a good rest.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** Stick to the mission.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** And then Rolly like peeks around the corner with a shack on his shoulders.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Like, all right, let's watch the end of this conversation.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** It's going to be hilarious.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** And then Rolly's going to go to bed and that's what you start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** So this is actually Baratheon Minor.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:45]** See, Baratheon Major, if you're looking at the stars, they're on Accuton.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** They're in the opposite pole.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** So the planet at this time of year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:55]** You're telling me that the stars are bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Yes.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** That is one.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:04]** Many cultures, you know, there are two schools of thought here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** Are they like people?

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** Do they think like us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Do they have like thoughts?

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:18]** If you're speaking with a Xeno warden, I mean, they would probably say yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** What you guys talking about, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Just talking about the stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** And this goblin wanders up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** All right, you guys.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** You guys want to go rest?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** It's my watch now.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** I'm here.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** I'm ready to watch.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** I'm watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** I'm watching.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** He puts his eyes up.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:41]** This little goblin's got his hands up over his eyes and he's looking out in the dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** Yeah, I think it's time for me to get some rest, but I'd like to hear more about these celestial bodies.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:53]** You know what I mean?

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** Yes, you could be coming on to me, and that's fine.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** What?

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:05]** And the acustic kind of like rubs the bottom elbow, because you've got four elbows.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** And he walks off to his tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** Thaddeus like mutters to Shaq, well, that went a lot better than I expected.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Where's the other guy?

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Shouldn't that be another guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** Thaddeus is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** Oh, there, yes, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:33]** He, like, lets Shock down, and Thaddeus, like, starts, he gives him a wink and starts walking out past the tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Hey.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:39]** Hey, you seem mighty calibrated and centered.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Oh, I just took a piss, you know.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** So now, why don't you go to bed, Rolo?

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Take a load off, get some rest, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** Sure, sure, yeah, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Rolo walks away.

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:13]** back into the tent walks back behind the tent picks up the edge of it crawls underneath it and gets into bed yep uh cool so you're on watch with wug bug who was actually one of the ones inside of the mech suit but they didn't see much because they were just a leg just one leg um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:21]** It's dark in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:25]** Oh, hey, so you're... Accurate.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** So good.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:28]** You're Cadius, is that right?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** I think... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** No, no, no, the name's Thaddeus.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** Cadius is a nickname I had growing up, and I don't mind.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** You can call me that if you wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Oh, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:50]** While this is happening, after Rolu goes to sleep, Chuck is going to try to sneak in to have a look at his bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** I'm definitely going to need some checks for this this time.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** So you're going into his bag?

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** I kind of want to do two rolls.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** I want a stealth check and a sleight of hand.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Or is that too much?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:08]** The good thing is you're the GM, so you get to decide if it's too much.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** There it is.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I'm going to roll for it.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Roll both?

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Which one first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Yeah, roll both.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** We'll do stealth because you're sneaking into the tent without trying to wake anybody, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** Beautiful.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Okay.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:34]** Now do a sleight of hand check because you're actually taking something from his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** 15.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** No, no.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** 11.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** 11.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Okay.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Great.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** So that's a tough one.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** I'm going to need a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:58]** John was telling us earlier, while you're asleep, you take a negative 10 penalty to perception checks.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** John told you that?

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Or maybe you did.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** I don't know who it was.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** Someone told me.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Just keep it in mind.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** We'll say Bob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** Must have read it somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:32]** yeah the will save ready so during during sleep uh you take a minus 10 penalty to perception checks to notice anything if you succeed at a perception check to notice something despite the penalty you automatically awaken uh you're also awoken if you're slapped or wounded so don't slap him oh god yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:40]** I imagine the view is like Chuck standing over him, ready to just like wail on his face.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** And the narrator goes, so don't slap him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:55]** Another, another thing here, just, just for a reference is it takes a standard action to wake an ally, but go ahead.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:00]** Give me one or two, just one perception check.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Cause I mean, it's 21 still perception.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:09]** The 20, the, the stop was more for everyone in the tent is the way I was doing that.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yeah.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Okay.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** And he aced that one.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:19]** So I had a, like Chuck was up on his, you know, he's got his, his like vines and he's just like tiptoeing on it.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:23]** Like his body's just dangling as his vines kind of tiptoe through the dark.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Anyways, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** I have a plus five to my perception.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** So with this, it's a minus five overall.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:39]** I think when you're going through, you do notice that one part of Rolo's mask is unclipped.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:46]** As if he sleeps just with one part of his mask unclipped.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** Does Rolo drool when he sleeps?

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** He doesn't drool when he sleeps.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Does he snore?

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** Does he have sleep apnea?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** He doesn't have sleep apnea, unfortunately.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:00]** Okay.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:09]** I rolled a two.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:23]** I think there might be a few moments where Rolu is like fitfully sleeping and clearly having a very intense dream.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:30]** So maybe you think something might happen, but you realize that he is dead asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Out.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Out cold.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:38]** I love it because you don't think you have sleep apnea, but everybody else knows it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** Because you're snoring too loud.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** Sawing logs.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:49]** I mean, I can describe my dream if you want, but maybe we'll save that for another time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:49 - 01:00:02]** So Chalk, you actually manage very sneakily supporting yourself here and there, and you use that third vine or fourth vine leaf head arm, and you feel around the coat.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** You feel a lump in this pocket.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** You feel his gun over there.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:12]** You feel some grenades in that pocket because he sleeps with all his stuff in his pocket.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** It's very weird.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** But you do manage to find...

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:23]** You managed to find that plate that you saw him pick up, the steel piece that came from the captain's trophy.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:35]** And it's wrapped up in some kind of parchment, almost like a physical map or scroll or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Is it?

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Is it?

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Okay.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** I want to get out of here first.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Cool, Shaq pockets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** Oh boy, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:48]** And splits, like, out of the tent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:57]** Roldu's cat ears kind of like are turning in different directions listening the whole time to hear for Shaq's shuffle out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** And he's like, ah, yeah, hilarious.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Yeah, f*** Roldu.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** And he's like, I'm just going to be over here for one second, all right?

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** You stay cool.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Kind of points at him awkwardly.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:12]** And kind of goes to the corner where Shaq might have come out of

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Did you find anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:26]** I want to roll a sense motive to figure out if I should trust Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:36]** Can I help answer the question as to why or justify it as with your answer, Kevin?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Well, anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** Sorry, what are you saying?

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** So he's going to roll Perception.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** You can roll... What do you roll against that, Bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** It depends on whether he's trying to hide his intentions.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** I'm not trying to hide anything.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** I was honest.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** I really was.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:58]** Thaddeus is on the side of the captain and the crew, period.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** No matter what you roll, you will find that to be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** Cool.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** Then...

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** I found this hunk of metal.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** It's wrapped in like weird paper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]** His eyes, like the metal sort of glitz off of the black of his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:22]** I'm assuming there's not much light to decipher what is on the parchment, Mr. GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** Well, you guys both have low light vision, right?

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** And it's still dark.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Yeah.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** But you guys are back behind the tent.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** One of you guys probably pulled up a flashlight.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:36]** Kelly, why don't you tell us what's on this piece of paper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:43]** So Thaddeus like sits down and then he sees these charts on here.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** And it's a chart for the Leovara system.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:52]** You know, you see these stars, these rings of the passages of stars and like highways in and out.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:58]** But then there's this corner that's frayed on the upper left.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:06]** He kind of like gives this knowing look at shock and then looks back and then he slowly peels it back.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:18]** And underneath this star map, there's a sort of a profile of a soldier whose name is Bron.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** It's this big husky human.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** And then it says,

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:56]** the other cargo bay like location the other cargo bay with the name of the ship that hears yeah I wonder where that comes from and it has the name of the ship that hears and members of the Nades Revenge uh broke into and uh and committed treason by doing so

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:02]** And then Thaddeus is like, I knew it.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** You're involved, aren't you, Rolo?

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** And he catches himself and tries to keep his volume low.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Good job, Shrek.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]** And then he takes a look at that other object, that heavy metal piece.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:17]** And they both have low light vision.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** So do they see anything, Kevin?

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Are they looking at it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Can they tell anything?

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** You see a symbol on it.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:33]** And you realize that that is the symbol on the doors to the stellar flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:41]** And that's our game.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]** Sketch on so many levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** This cold war just got hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:53]** Oh, this Cold War just got icy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** What are you up to, man?

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]** What are you up to?

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:00]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:07]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
