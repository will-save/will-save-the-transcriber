**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:02]** Welcome back to another episode of We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:03]** I am Kevin.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:04]** I am your GM.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:06]** But I just want to kind of... Hello, world.

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:07]** Yeah.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** Hello, world.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:08]** Hi, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Thanks for tuning in again.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** You kind of want to what, Kev?

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** What's up, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:14]** I don't know, man.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:15]** I was thinking of a good transition.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:17]** Let's just... Okay.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Screen goes black.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** Lights come back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Oh.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Hey, Kevin.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:23]** Move this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** And we're rolling.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** We're rolling.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Thank you, Rolu.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Can you come in and have a seat?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Sure.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:37]** Out of everyone, thank you so much for volunteering to talk to us.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:41]** It's been pretty difficult to get your crew to open up at all.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** There's only been like four of you.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:53]** There's been you, the captain's plant, an admin guy, and then there's Patra that likes to brag about his body part collection.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** Don't get me started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Don't get me started on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:02]** But I think I just appreciate you for like, you know, crowning those guys and getting them into room with us.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** I know it's we're outsiders and, you know, I get it.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:11]** I mean, I don't even know if I'm ever going to get a chance to talk to your captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** That's a good question.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** You might be a look, I'll see what I can do.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** I'm not pushing.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** I mean, you sound like you're pushing when you say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:24]** From the other, like from what I've heard about your crew, like he's a scary dude.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** I don't, I'm not sure.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:28]** I think, you know, maybe just get, I'll send the camera guy and that's it.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** That's all we need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** All right.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** I just, maybe you're not ready for the captain.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** It's okay.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** I'm not, I'm definitely not, but it's okay.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Okay.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:45]** What I do want to say, though, is this time, this question is a very personal and very serious question.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:52]** So if you feel uncomfortable, if you want to decline, we're not trying to create any kind of conflict.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** So are you ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Go ahead and ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** Okay, so if you're willing to tell us...

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:09]** Can you tell us how you got involved with the Free Captains or just pirating in general?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Like, what led you to this lifestyle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Great question.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:22]** It was a tough tempering for me.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:28]** It's the first time being away from my family, my clan.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:37]** And I won't get too deep into it, but I didn't walk away with the rosiest of memories from that.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:44]** So, I also didn't come back into the most welcoming hands.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:53]** So for me, it seemed like, well, how do I say this?

**[00:03:53 - 00:04:00]** As much as I appreciate the Adari, I don't know that I can call the Adari my home.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** So the free captains was the next best thing.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** That's touching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** I'm sorry.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** The Adaris... You came from the Adari?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:16]** No, I came from a separate ship, actually.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Not a...

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:27]** Not talked about, truly, unless you're in a kind of in-the-know circle of Kasathans and grew up.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:33]** But there are Kasathans who didn't leave on the Adari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:43]** And so because you were not a part of the Adari, you were not accepted into the Kasathans from the Adari?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** You're an outsider to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:55]** I don't know that I'd say I'm an outsider, but I would say that my family and clan is not well accepted on the Adari.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** Interesting.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** I'm actually very sorry to hear that, but I thank you so much for opening up to that.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:09]** We do have other questions, but I think the way we have this kind of set up is we're going to just take one question at a time, especially a heavy question like this.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** We're going to let it breathe.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** Where is this airing again?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** When can I watch?

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:23]** It's actually going to be on the Sci-Fi Channel, which is a very serious documentary channel on Pac-TV.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** I've got your contact.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** I may have some edits that I want you to make.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** So, you know, you caught me in a moment.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** You can catch us.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** It's fine.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** It's fine.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** We can just... I mean, I'll make notes.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** It's not a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** It's okay.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** No, that's okay.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** It's okay.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Do you mind?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:48]** I think we have the yeoman chief waiting for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** Is there any more of that candy from last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:52 - 00:06:04]** Actually, we had Skittles, but there was a report that there might be an issue with the dyes they're using, so we actually took those away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** There are mints and... No candy.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** It's fine.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** It's fine.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** It's fine.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeoman...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Yes.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Come on in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Thank you, Rolo.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** We really do appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Yep.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Yep.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** What is the meaning of this interruption?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** Oh, you volunteered for our documentary series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** I don't recall signing a waiver for this, but fine.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Uh...

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:43]** Have your people contact my people with the details on any appearance fees as well as compensation for this interview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** Sorry, Yeoman Chief.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:50]** We definitely coordinated with Yeoman Third Class.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Sorry.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** Your Third Class definitely said that this was approved by your ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:00]** I never approved of such activities before.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:04]** Well, do you mind?

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** Very well.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Let's get on with it.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** What do you need?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** Do you need me to procure something for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** Well, if you could just take a seat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:30]** So just so you understand, our documentary series, it's called It's a Pirate's Life, and we are trying to travel around on as many free captain ships as possible.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** There are some smaller... Do you guys know about the other?

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:42]** We're looking at the other smaller pirate organizations, but the free captains are the most well-known, so we're definitely...

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:50]** looking to get their voices heard and so we were told that you were willing to sit down and talk to us and

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** The question today is kind of a heavy one.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:58]** So again, like I told Rulu, but like also with you, if you don't feel comfortable, you don't have to answer.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** We totally understand.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:12]** But the question we're asking today is, can you tell us how you got involved with the free captains or how you got into pirating life in the first place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** How I became a yeoman chief on this vessel, you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** Not so much, like, your current position, but, like, just the lifestyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Well, I was hired to do a position.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:28]** I was told it would be of great opportunity for me.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:36]** I was outside the Riven Shroud and some sort of starship graveyard and...

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:46]** I met Goldhorn while we were haggling over some, uh, Cavallari Collective starship parts for Castorvillian starships.

**[00:08:47 - 00:09:00]** And, uh, he said, you know, after, after some back and forth, uh, we had agreed that we could serve each other's interests aboard his ship.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** There'd be great opportunity for both trade as well as, uh,

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:10]** Well, adventure and possibly treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** So you were directly recruited by the captain of this ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Oh, great.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** All right.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** Did you have any... Was there any withdraw... Is that the right term?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:26]** Withdrawals to any kind of inhibitions into merging into this lifestyle?

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Or you were completely on board?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:32]** As you probably are aware...

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** Perhaps you aren't, but you should be, or your viewers should be.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:41]** Which words we are... Excuse me.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:48]** We are very adept to this sort of lifestyle.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Interesting.

**[00:09:51 - 00:10:00]** We often find ourselves in the employ or employing, you know, mercenaries of some sort.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:08]** dealing with these types of, uh, relationships aboard a star vessel of hired help as well as, uh,

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Okay, great.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Well, thank you.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Thank you so much for answering that.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** Of course, yes.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** So you are aware we are definitely on your ship and we were asking questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:22]** Yes, make sure the paperwork's in order next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** I'll make sure we get that forwarded to you for sure.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Thank you again.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:30]** I think the next person in line, I was told, is Chuck.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** You need me to fetch the chop.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** No, not the chop.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** The chalk.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Chalk.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** The raxolite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Yes, very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Chalk.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:45]** Just for our viewers, a chop is the supply officer on board this ship.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** They're called the chop.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Or the P-C-H-O-P.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Chop.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** I'll be right there.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** I promise I'm coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:05]** But this next guest is the captain's personal assistant.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Is that what your title is?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Close enough.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Hi, Chuck.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** All right.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:13]** Personal assistant, companion, pet, houseplant, whatever he needs.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I didn't know if that was an appropriate term.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** I don't want to step on your shoes or anything.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Not that you wear shoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** I don't wear shoes, but if I did, you haven't stepped on them.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Great.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** We're not easily offended.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** I don't know about the rest of my people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Well, I think that's a good place to lead off.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:37]** Just so you're aware, if we're going to ask a question, you don't have to answer it if you don't want to.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** We totally understand.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Well, it was good seeing you.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** No, no, no.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** We're going to ask you a question, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** It's just like...

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** The question we're going to ask is a little, little intense for some people.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:51]** So I just, Ooh, if you have any reservations on it, like, please let us know.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** But the question is, I better get to it before you forget.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:59]** Um, can you tell us how you got involved with the free captains with pirating in general?

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** How did you end up being the captain's companion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:06]** That's a good question.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:21]** So my parents were part of the initial delegation to Castroville and came back, told stories of what it was like to experience other places.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** And so I, naturally, was curious.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:30]** Decided to travel the world, trying my hand at comedy.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:36]** And the captain saw me, thought I was funny, asked if I'd like to come along, and here we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** You're the court jester.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** No.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** Wow.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** Okay.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Thank you, Chuck.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** I really appreciate that.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** That was a very... I did not expect that.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Yeah.

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:02]** So your family is... I wouldn't say royalty, but like a part of governmental... a governmental organization on Castroville?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Yeah.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** I mean, it was either a piracy stand-up company or a career in politics.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** So I figured we at least cut people's throats from the front over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:42]** wow uh yeah about that yep and he he kind of waves at the camera guy like uh we're gonna cut that is that is that it are we good yeah no we're so we're gonna be on the ship we're gonna be around you might see us feel free to engage us whenever you want um but we will be probably asking you more questions in the future yeah anytime thank you so much yeah you're welcome hey so who who do we have next on the list oh it's that cat guy again

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Ah, not that guy.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** I guess have him... Go get him.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:52]** And somebody actually goes out into the hallway and kind of... The cameraman's kind of a big hefty guy.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** A human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** And he... Unhand me.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Unhand me.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** I can walk myself in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** weapons officer.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Thaddeus, correct?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** You like to be called Thaddeus?

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** That's right.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** That is my name.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I don't like to be called it.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** That's what you can call me.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** Can you take a seat for us?

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** You did, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** We're doing several.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** We're doing groups of questions.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** We didn't want to bog everybody down with a full day of questions.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** We're on the ship for about a week and a half.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Periodically, we'll pull you in and ask you a question or two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** All right, well, time's ticking along.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** Let's get on with it then, shall we, Savvy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** So I have to warn you ahead of time.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** This question is a little deep, and you do not have to answer it if you don't want to.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** But here's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** I didn't know that was an option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:43 - 00:15:01]** they didn't have to answer for me it's not your turn get out of here shut up that is uh so that that is so the question is how did you get involved with the free captains what what drew you to pirate life in general


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:05]** That's not at all a deep question, personally.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** I'd gladly answer that.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:23]** I, if you know anything about me, Patra, I was in a survival challenge in my adolescence, and actually, I killed the most of the natural enemies that we faced, and also the most of my kin that were also involved of that.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:28]** I was particularly skilled at creative ways of killing them, too.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** I was good at

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:34]** deriving poisons from local amphibians and stuff like that to aid in the cause, if you know what I mean.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:42]** Then I was recruited, because I was very good at this, into some various campaigns that my people were involved in.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** I was a natural killer, and so started joining cruises there.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:53]** Well, the fixer, I suppose you could call me.

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:00]** Eventually, I came across our current captain, and I saved him in a bit of a scrape that he was in, and here I am.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:10]** And I can freely do my experiments that I like to do with the various animals and creatures that I come across, and that's what I spend my time doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Wow, thank you for that.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** That was very revealing.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** We appreciate your time.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** I think that's the only question we have for today.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:24]** You might see us about the ship, but feel free to engage us as needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Next time, bring more candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** Yeah, we're working on that.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I've got to talk to your chop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Where are the Skittles, though?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** For real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** There are any Skittles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** There's no candy here.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** There's just these mints.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** All right.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Well, Shaq probably likes the mints.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** I'll leave them here.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** I'm out.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Bye.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:51]** Kevin, were you trying to ask him questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:57]** I was going to add they must have banned Skittles because of the titanium dioxide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** They only just found out.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** They only realized it.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** They found them all for paint.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** Yeah, they're using it as paint.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Wow, way to spring that on us, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Just throwing that in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** I thought that'd be fun right out the gate.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** Do you guys have anything else to talk about?

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** Because I think it's time to play.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** You seem nervous, Kev.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Yeah, Kevin, why are you so nervous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** I mean, it's not like we're pirates or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** Are you afraid we're going to lose?

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** He's like, you guys are about to die.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** You just don't know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:38]** Just to be a little transparent with mostly the listener here, you guys all cover your ears.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** I made this engagement from scratch.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** This is all my doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:50]** Oh, so you actually are going to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** I'm not trying to.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** It's an unbalanced fight.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That's what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** Completely unbalanced, barely.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** I was like, oh, they're level two.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** They can handle anything.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Kevin.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** What is your concept of leveling?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** I don't know what your concept of leveling is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** You said at the beginning you didn't know what CR meant, and I'm beginning to believe you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Yeah, truly.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** That's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Let me see.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Hold on.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** Yeah, yeah, you guys are fine.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** This is only a CR 7.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** That's good.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** You add up all of your levels together and you're now at eight.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Oh, you're supposed to divide by the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Did you not know that?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:34]** You're supposed to divide by the number of members in the party, so it's average party level is two.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** I think you'll be fine.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** I'm sure you'll all survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** I'm kidding.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Furiously scratching out his papers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:49]** I've done a lot of editing to my notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:55]** He just circles Space Goblin named Boblin.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Boblin.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** I am a little bit worried about the Salarian, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** You're not supposed to know that she's a Salarian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** It was obviously a Salarian.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** It was very obvious.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** It was super obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Not to the players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** Okay, well... So wipe that from your memories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Let me just do a rundown.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Okay.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** So last week, you got up from the explosion and you kept moving.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** You came to an opening and you got some cell phone coverage, which let Tremé download the rest of that message from Radioman.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:33]** Those files seemed to grab Thaddeus' attention, but Rolu was able to refocus the group and get moving around that corner.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:38]** But right as you came around that corner, you ran into Tez Tronin of the True Warriors.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:45]** Rolu was very quick to provoke them, and a battle ensued.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:52]** With that battle, Chak got right up in the face and right up in the mix and was very quickly overlooked.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** I rolled a few perception checks and completely missed him.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** And...

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** But Torme, luckily, was able to make Tez's gun jam.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** A tough true warrior, Bull Rush Thaddeus.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:13]** And, oh yeah, the Yusokis ran for cover in the junk and were attacked by K'Fox.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Yeah.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** So we're kind of in the middle of it.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** So I'm going to just drop you guys onto the map.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** All right.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** To the map.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Here we go.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Bam.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** And it's the same map you guys have seen before because we've been in it for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** Go ahead and describe to me what you see, Kelly.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:38]** Okay, so Thaddeus and Rolu are... And Vahri 18?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Is that what she is again?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** Vahri 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** Vahri 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Whatever.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:49]** Vahri and then Thaddeus and Rolu are chilling out at the north of this three-way intersection.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** On the west side, we have...

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:58]** Those, like, various, like, components that had the very first K'Vox that we encountered when we came in.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:06]** The Salarian, in parentheses, non-Salarian, according to Kevin, is, like, chilling out in front of those, away from them.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:12]** But two of the Ysoki are now basically battling two K'Vox, which is awesome.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** And then Tremayden is...

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** kind of chilling out southeast.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** And where's Shaq?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Oh, there's Shaq.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Shaq is perplexed.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** Very unwisely, very, very close to the Salarian right now.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:32]** Chuck ran forward and was like, he used an operative action or an envoy.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Is it an envoy or operative?

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** Envoy.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** That was like, look me in the face or something.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** What was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Not in the face.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Not in the face.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Look me in the face.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:50]** Chuck basically ran up, yelled at the dude, and he still was just like, no, I'm good.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Moving right along.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** It wasn't worth his time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** He's a tough true warrior.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** He doesn't mess with small, tiny creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** And that's the thing.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:10]** The remaining mention to be made is that that one true warrior with his bandana and his big, big sideburns is pretty close to Rulier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** I just want to point out, I don't know if I gave him the description, but he's a large man.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:25]** He's a Hilki, so he's got dark red skin, but he's on the verge of no longer being considered medium.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:28]** He's a very hefty, medium-sized creature.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** By creature, I mean humanoid.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Hilkis are humans.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** I should just be clear.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Hilkis are humans.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** They just live on Akiton.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** No, this guy is just much larger than the typical.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** He's a tough... That's why they've given the title tough.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** Cool.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Well, let's roll into it.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:50]** It is the Yosuke True Warrior's turn.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:55]** The one that was attacked by the K'fok, he's freaking out.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** He thought we were like, oh, we're here to shoot these.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:02]** I'm just going to shoot at these pirate dudes and call it a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** You were wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:08]** And then he ended up getting confronted by this K'fok out of a pile of junk.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:13]** And so now he's almost in a panic and he just turns and he shoots at the K'fok from point blank range.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** And he's going to do a full round action attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:20]** Doesn't he incur an AOL?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** I'm getting there, John.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** I'm getting there.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Let's say yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** While he is going to... I thought that happens before the shot.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** You're right.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** You're right.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Yeah.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** I mean, that's what the core rulebook says, but Kevcon is a new rules lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Yeah, you know.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** So I didn't... I'll...

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** This dice roll was for the Kefauk, as planned.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Nine on the dice.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Now I've got to look up what the Kefauks to hit was.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** So it's plus four is a 13.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** That hits.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** So the Kefauks strikes.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:59]** And that is going to be one d6 of slashing damage.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** That's two points of damage to this Yosuke.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** He is not looking great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** He already took some damage earlier, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Yes.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:10]** He's down a bit.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** But now it's Yusuke's turn, so Yusuke is going to shoot at the fuck.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** That is a natural one.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** Amazing.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Amazing.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** So satisfying.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** It's so good.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** Until it happens to us, then it's really bad.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Yeah, then it's not satisfying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** I forget.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** Are we doing critical card?

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** We have a critical card deck, but not the critical fail card deck?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** We have the critical fumble deck if you want to use it.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:53]** i like those they're fun that way i don't i don't have to think got it right here okay you want to tell me when to stop go ready three two one stop

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Cut the deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:02]** You're using... That is a kinetic ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Kinetic ranged weapon.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** It's a kinetic weapon.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Gob smacked.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:18]** You must succeed at a... Or you can't take... Or you can't speak for 1d4 rounds.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** can't speak.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** That's it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** For a kinetic weapon?

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Yeah, that's what it says.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Gob smacked.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Well, that's alright, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** You know, sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** What is the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** DC is... Hold on.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** I rolled a nine and I have a zero.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** Oh, then you failed because it's 10 plus one half the attacks level or item level.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** So you failed.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** So you can't speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** So he's silenced.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Is that the proper?

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** He's silenced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** So he can't use any spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** That would require a vocal component.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Or communicate.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Or communicate in any way.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** And four, you should roll a 1d4.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** For damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** No, for 1d4 rounds.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Two rounds.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Two rounds.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** Is there anything else that happens for critical fail?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** I don't think so.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** I think you just lose your attack.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** Okay, so I was going to do a full round of attack, so can I use a second attack?

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** That's a good question.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Critical fail on the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Good question.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Good question.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** So, rules as written, one is just an automatic miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Okay.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Yeah.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** I think that's it.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Okay.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** So, there's nothing saying that they can't take a second attack.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** You just can't say, I'm attacking you again.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Well, I've already said he's taking two attacks.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Yeah, but he can't speak.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** The Yosuke can't.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** You're right.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** I don't think he said out loud that he was going to do two attacks anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** He's not like, that is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Yeah.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** I'm going to attack twice now, just for fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Yes, I will attack twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Make sure you reload.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** Oh, this dice is doing fantastic.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:01]** That was a two on the dice with a minus four to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** It's a negative two.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** I think that's an automatic death.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Is that how it works?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** He shoots himself in the foot?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Yeah, it really blows, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** I didn't add in his attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** He knocks out his other front tooth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:40]** complete miss let me go back to my initiative tracker so that was a waste of a round it is now Termay's turn Termay ah yes seeing this red skinned person just charging up towards us I am going to cast stumble nice interesting

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** Are you going to tell us what that does and how we've implied?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:54]** Stumble momentarily transposes the position of the limbs of a target to move or interfere with its propitiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** Pro-preception?

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Proprioception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Proprioception.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** If the target fails its reflex save, it's off target.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** I can move only half speed for one round.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Nice.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Dope.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:15]** Is there a save associated with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** DC 13.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** 14, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** 13.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** Well, my natural 17 passes.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** Dang it!

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Is it just completely negated?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Okay.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** All right.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Do you want to move?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** That was a standard action to cast that, I'm assuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yeah, standard action.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** I don't want to move.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Okay.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:41]** I'm trying to think, is there anything that I could use in place of a move that is... You could draw a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** You could go prone.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Prone is actually a free action.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Then you could stand back up.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** You could do a burpee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Yeah, I was just going to say, dude, start doing some burpees.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** No, I think I'm okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** I'm okay back here.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** I'm okay, uh...

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Maybe I'll move up a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** You sure that you don't want to do an intimidate check by doing a bunch of burpees?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** You can only do one.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** Weird flex, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** One per round.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** Maybe two per round if you use your standard action to do a burpee.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Double move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** I mean, two burpees every six seconds sounds about right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Could I bully the guy?

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** You're talking about intimidate?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:31]** I feel like if you're going to intimidate, again, we talked about this, if you're going to intimidate to... You can intimidate to bully a creature, temporarily change its attitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** I think that would be a standard action that is in place of a standard action.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:42]** Because if you're not actually going to change somebody else... Demoralize is a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Bully doesn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Oh, interesting.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** You could be onto something there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** I can't take you serious with your face like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:58]** Will's face just looks like every cartoon meme.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** It's so good.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Can you do anything else?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Nah, forget it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Okay.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** All right.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Moving on to Thaddeus then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** Thaddeus right away.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:13]** When he leveled up, he got this ability called Victory Cry, which I think I briefly mentioned.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:18]** But since Rolu on his last turn did some... I think he critted.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:23]** So what Thaddeus can now do is he can shout at Rolu.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** And unfortunately, he has to use this phrase.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Sorry, Rolu.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** This doesn't really make sense.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** But he's like, regroup!

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** And he just shouts it into Rolu's ear.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:40]** And then Rolu, you regain stamina points equal to your class level plus your charisma bonus.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** I don't know if that helps him or not.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Wow.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** I hope it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** I was down one stamina.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Okay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** All right.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:50]** Well, you get one stamina back.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** So I get one stamina.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Dude, that's great, though.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** There you go.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** There's that one stamina, Rolu.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Enjoy.

**[00:30:55 - 00:31:05]** And then Thaddeus is going to, by the way, for the listener, I recently found out, unfortunately, that for the Formium Venomcaster, it is an unwieldy weapon.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** And so Thaddeus can't take full actions on it anymore.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** So he can only do a single shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Just to establish, Kelly is a cheater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:17]** Just to establish, Kelly has come clean about this of his own volition.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** He's on the road to recovery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Does it change the past?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** Kelly is admittedly a cheater.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** The first step is admitting that you have a problem.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:39]** Thaddeus says, you know, Rulu, I was thinking I've been particularly awesome recently, but I found out that...

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:47]** I think that some of the sort of ingredients that I've gotten from those various frogs, do you remember, on that planet that we were on before that I killed?

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:52]** Like, you know, when I injected them into me, they gave me extra strength, but I think the effects worn off.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** So I can only do one shot now, unfortunately.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:04]** And he's going to take that shot, and that's just a poison dart, and he's going to shoot it at the big Pilkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:11]** It's an 18 to hit, and it's 8 damage plus the poison effect.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:18]** Okay, so that is 8 damage from just being shot by your device.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** And... Yes.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** It is a DC what?

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Injection DC plus 2.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** It's a DC of...

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:53]** apologies let me just double check i think it's a dex save because it's like so let me take off poison where you rolled a d8 is that what you said i rolled a d8 it no uh d8 eight damage plus the poison effect so you rolled a d8 and you got eight on it i got eight on it yeah oh my god okay so i'm taking note of that and then what is the dc save for this sorry i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I think I might have it somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** Turbocurinine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Is it turbocurinine?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** Turbocurinine chloride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** DC-14.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** That's a Wikipedia article.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Yeah, 14.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Okay, so it's DC-14.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** I'm going to roll to save.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Natural 20, so I think that's a pass.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** Wow.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** So I don't get poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Whatever, you get a damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:18]** This turn, but I have to roll every turn for four rounds, right?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** Because it says once per round for four rounds.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** So remind me on every time.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:30]** And I believe you also poisoned Tez Tronin.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Probably.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:38]** Every turn, they need to do a saving throw for up to four rounds as they move on to the next track.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** And as we talked about with this poison, it's a one-save cure, so they can move back up the track.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:49]** The key thing here is this is the initial attack, so therefore he takes an extra four points of damage because it's 14.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:54]** It's a DC minus 10 damage for poisons.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** So...

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:18]** oh yeah that's so poison man this guy was was a was a tough warrior and he charged he pushes you back and then you turn around and shoot him in the stomach because he's not wearing a shirt because he's that tough and he just looks down at the dart and you see his arms just kind of get weaker like physically weaker amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Now make sure every turn you roll.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** You tell them to the hooky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** To the hooky.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** You, sir.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:28]** By the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:35]** You're going to want to check that every six seconds from now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Oh, it's fantastic.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Okay, so you did your shot.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** Are you going to take a move action?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Or was that two things?

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Was that a standard action to do the... No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** It's a free action for the shot.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Free action for that.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** A standard action to shoot.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** Thaddeus will briefly move behind here.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Okay, so you're going to run away.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Got it.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Not running away.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Tactical retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** I'm just calling it like I should run.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Wait, wait.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** For the listener and for me.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Thaddeus just got around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** He did a tactical retreat around the corner.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** No, I'm coming.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** It's fine.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** I just want... Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:16]** As he goes, he puts his fingers up and he goes, Hashtag, it's okay to walk away.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** It's okay to tactical retreat.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** You'll be fine.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** And he just kind of disappears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Oh, my God.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** You'll be fine.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** Well, moving on to Chalk's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Here we go.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:36]** Chalk is incensed that this Hilki would ignore him, would dare deny his existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** Chak stomps over in front of the Helki.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** Says, don't you dare ignore me ever again.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** And that's going to be his use of not in the face again.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Is that your whole turn?

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** That's my whole turn.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** It's two move actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** What does not in the face do again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** He gets a minus four on attack rolls against me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Oh, so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** I love that Chak doesn't attack.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** He just runs around going, hey, look at me.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:07]** Chak is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** Look at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** That's his whole move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:15]** He just buffs and debuffs everyone.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** I like it.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** He really does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** That's so funny.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Amazing.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** That's the end of your turn.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** We're now moving on to the next Yosuke's turn.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:31]** That Yosuke is the second one that was not as damaged as

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** Still damaged by a K'fok there, both engaged with the K'fok at close quarters.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:41]** This one, though, it gets attacked the first time, but it actually has the mindset to take a guarded step back.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:46]** But from where you guys are, he's actually taking a guarded step kind of away from the group, and he steps back.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** And then he's going to do a full round attack.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** Or no, sorry, not a full round because it's a guarded step.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** He's going to do an attack on the K'fok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** That is a 14 plus.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I'm getting my eyes all mixed up.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Okay, that's an 18 to hit.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** That is definitely a hit.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Nice.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** And so I'm going to roll my D6 damage.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** That's what we need.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** That is a one.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:14]** So he caps off at that K'fok, and he takes a hit point out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Yep.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** What we didn't learn until today is that K'foks are natural predators for Ysoki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** I mean, it's definitely the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** We should try to tame them.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Actually, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** Yeah, I mean, they're mindless creatures.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:35]** We can look into survival rules because you actually roll survival in order to tame a wild creature, I think.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** But if you want to look into that, go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** If you can permatame them, then I'm super.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** It takes time though.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** It is now Tez Tronin's turn.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** She's the boss.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Let me just do this real quick.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** What are you doing?

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Okay.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** I rolled perception.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** She rolled very high.

**[00:37:54 - 00:38:00]** So she just has this insane sense of the battlefield.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:14]** She recognizes that her two Yusokis are now engaged with K'Fox behind her, but she's also really noticed how bad off her tough true warrior is, her muscle.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** And so she's a little frustrated by that.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** But she's going to tough it out.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** She's also poisoned with dex poison.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:27]** So I took off, I think, everything there, including a minus two on my attack roll.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** She's going to raise her azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** That was not working the last round, thanks to Treme.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** And she ratchets it again.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:42]** It's whatever a laser cartridge looks like when you ratchet it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** I don't know if you ratchet laser cartridges.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** I got to rethink that.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:51]** Anyways, she fiddled her gun all last round, so she thinks it's prepped to go.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** She's going to actually aim at Termay this time.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** And there's no cover there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** Why is there no cover here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** Because if I draw a straight line from this corner, I can get to all four of your corners.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** So I'm going to roll to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:22]** Just for the listener, Tez is like right smack in the middle of the battlefield, and Termay is over on the corner in the slightly narrower part, a good like 40 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:30]** But all the other characters are kind of hidden behind this very large hilkey, so she wouldn't have a clear shot at them anyways.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:36]** So she raises her gun, she aims at Termay, and she rolled a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** Get out of here.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Go ahead and break out the deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Pull the critical fail list again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:46]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** I am into this.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** I'm going to need you to split the deck first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** I don't trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Hopefully it's something a little cooler than that.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Like not something lame like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** I don't know, if you silence a... You can't cook food for like a week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:01]** Silence a slur.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** You can't cook food for a week.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** More interesting than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:10]** Your direct deposit messes up and you don't get your paycheck.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** You can no longer deposit by mobile phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** You're locked out of your account.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** You're going to have to call.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** You're going to have to 2FA.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Oh, we're closed.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Yeah, you're going to have to 2FA, but we're closed now.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** I'm sorry.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** I have to wait until tomorrow.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** All right.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Here we go.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** It's cut.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** I'll cut live on air.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Go ahead.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Let's see the deck.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Okay, here we go.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Here's the deck.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** I'll cut it for you so you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Ooh, look at that.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:33]** Beautiful handwork.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Okay, ready?

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Three, two... Our listeners are really missing out.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** We should get some video up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** I did magic when I was younger, so it's cool.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Ready?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Three, two, one.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Stop.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Okay.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:50]** Top card says, what kind of attack is this?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** Kinetic energy or melee?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Wait, kinetic energy or magic?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** It is an azimuth laser, so it would be energy.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Energy.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Ooh.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:04]** Frighteningly bad shot.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** You are shaken for 1d4 rounds.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Nice.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** That's a good, that's not a bad thing.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Yeah, that's actually pretty great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** Okay, can somebody quickly pull open Shaken?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Shaken, you are spooked.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:24]** You take a minus two penalty to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:33]** If you become subject to any additional effect that would cause you to be shaken, the duration of this condition increases by the duration of the second effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Wow.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** So this is on top of being poison.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** You guys are messing this.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:44]** For being an overpowered character, you guys are really...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:49]** Will just came back on with his grin.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** It's just so good.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** We have to share that picture.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** The Cheshire Cat has nothing on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Truly.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:03]** With her, she has this super high perception of this battlefield.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** And she came in here with such high confidence.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:09]** I'm going to push around these minor characters.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:17]** But now that she's fully engaged with you and sees how quickly you're taking them out and how affected she is, she's getting concerned.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** And when she missed her first shot and then she shot right at Tremaine...

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** She just knew as soon as she pulled that trigger, it was going to miss.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:31]** And there was something about it that it just reverberated back through her arm and all the way up to her soul.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** And she's scared.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** She's, quote unquote, shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Shook, as the kids would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:48]** And because of that, she is going to take a couple steps back.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** Oh, no way.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Yeah.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** She's second guessing this.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:58]** But she steps back, but she keeps the confidence in her voice.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:06]** And she's like, I don't know who you are, but I know that you will die on this planet someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:35]** and it's now rolu's turn well first thaddeus shouted in rolu's ear so he's like oh and then i think he's gonna be like and then he hears rolu talking about like the how he's about to attack or whatever and he's like rolu now is just not the time and turns to look and rolu's gone rolu's around the corner you mean that sorry you want to yeah sorry thaddeus is around the corner yeah rolu's yelling at himself this is very confusing whoa rolu's gone rolu's lost it finally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:40]** And he's like, tapping his fingers together.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Yes, he's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** All I need to do to defeat Roland is shout regroup at him very loudly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:50]** Can I... Would I see Tez moving back?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** Is that pretty clear to me, or do I need to roll a perception flip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** I think you would notice.

**[00:43:54 - 00:44:04]** You're like in a direct line... Your direct line of sight is kind of blocked by this giant Hilkie, but through his armpits and around his hips or whatever, you kind of duck down and see his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:24]** between his his legs okay i think not as an intimidation but i think rolu's gonna gonna look back at the this giant lumbering hilkey and gonna see tez walking away and he's just gonna look the hell she didn't walk away she kind of stepped backwards

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** casually strolled in a cool manner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** She has confidence about it.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** It's called a tactical retreat.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** It's her special ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** It's a tactical.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** It's a swagger retreat.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** She's actually an envoy.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Level 9 envoy.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Got it.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** She's a level 9.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Wow.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** This is a CR 10 encounter.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** This is great.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:52]** Uh, so I think we're always going to look at the, uh, at the, the Hill key right in the eye and say, you're alone now.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** That was horrible.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** You're alone now.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** Even your boss is abandoning you.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** And we're always going to do a full attack action.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** First shot, natural two.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Oh!

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Wild miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Go ahead.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Tell me your bonus on that.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** That might hit.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** It was two.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Well, it was a full attack, so it was just flat two.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Okay.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** And then I got a flat nine on the second one.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** That also misses.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:36]** Not very intimidating, but Rolo also looks back to make sure that even though Thaddeus ran away in a non-swaggerly retreating kind of way, he wanted to make sure that Bari 13 is still behind him.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** And they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** They are, and it is their turn.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:47]** Vary 13 is right behind Rolu, kind of in line with all the action and protected.

**[00:45:47 - 00:46:00]** They are going to put their hand kind of on Rolu's shoulder to let him know that he's still guarding them, but they are going to step out and take a shot at the Hilki.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** Nice.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** With their tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:10]** Oh, that is a 16 on the dice for a total of 20.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** And that is a hit.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** There's a D6.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** I'm going to switch dice and use a better D6.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:39]** wow that was only two points of damage but uh vari 13 kind of sidesteps behind rolu hand on one shoulder and left hand pulls the trigger and hits the hilki clean in the chest for a nice shot uh that that true warrior is looking rough yes all according to plan

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** And that is the end of Vahri 13's turn.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:45]** It is now Kefauk number one's turn.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** And you know what Kefauk's going to do?

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Attack.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Kefauk's going to attack twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** You missed an opportunity there to say attack.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Kefauk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I don't think I did attack.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** No, I think it was miss.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:05]** Well, even with a minus four, that first one is a hit.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** Let me see.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** I'm going to switch dice just to make sure I... Oh, the second one misses.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:14]** So I'm going to get a d6 slash of damage.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:19]** That is five points of damage to the first Yasuki true warrior.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Yeah.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Hope that warrior dies.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:26]** Not on this turn, but that guy is also not looking strong.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** It is Kapok number...

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:44]** two's turn and kafok number two is not looking that good but it it tries to strike anyways and oh does a 14 hit does it does it probably not right

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** It does.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** A 14 does hit.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:55]** So the second Yosuke had stepped back, so the Kafak climbs out of the pit and strikes.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** And it does hit for a total of four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Yeah.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** What a great attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** I'm really committed to that.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:09]** That was a stretch.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** No, it's fine.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Inspiration, John.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Oh, dude, thank you.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** I don't think that's how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Dude, I definitely get punishment for that.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** I've heard nothing better for the last entire game.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** Dude, it's so true.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Thank you, man.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** You're running a great game, Kelly.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Thank you so much.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:32]** This is so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** I'll remember this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** What was that voice?

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Kevin's actually Dr. Claw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:49]** It is now the true warrior's turn.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** He is not looking good.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Sorry, he is poisoned, right?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:57]** No, he passed his Fortitude save, so he's not... It is his turn, though, so he must do another Fortitude save.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** He must.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** He passes that one as well, but he does not take damage, so he is safe for now.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** But he's not looking very good.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** Though, he is right next to Chak.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:14]** He's actually going to fight defensively.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Wow.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** You love to see it.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** I think it's a minus four.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Wait, I put it in my notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Okay.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** I'm looking at it right now.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:30]** Yeah, it's a minus four penalty to all attacks in addition to the ones you get for making a full attack.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** And you get a plus two bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:38]** Yeah, so I get a plus two bonus to his AC.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Let me mark that down.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** Plus two.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Okay.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** What's his name again?

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** His name is... You haven't asked his name.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** I'm asking right now.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** You're asking him?

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Sure.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:48]** What's your name?

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** It's Michael.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** That's a very weird question to ask a guy that's about to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** I love that journey for you, Michael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** He's very confused by it.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:04]** But he does this kind of like he widens his stance and he cracks his knuckles together.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:09]** And then he's going to just drop his fist right onto Chak.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** No.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** Because he is fighting defensively.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** No.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** So he gets a minus four.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** But he's doing a full attack.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** So it's a minus eight.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** It's a minus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:22]** No, you can only fight defensively as a full action.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** That is not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:28]** You can fight defensively as a full action, or you can fight defensively as a standard action.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** It's a minus four.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** If it's a full, you get a minus eight.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** If it's a full attack, you get a minus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Yes.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:41]** So then I also... Or you could attack once with a minus four.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Yes.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:47]** Or you can fight defensively in just a standard action or a standard attack, right?

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** As like a normal attack.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** With a minus four.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** And it's just minus four.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** But since you're fighting, you're getting the minus four for the full attack.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** So it's a minus eight.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** So I don't want to double dip.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** It is a minus eight total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Okay.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** It's a minus 12 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** What?

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Because for a full attack.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Not in the face.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Clever.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Very clever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** Wow, dude.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** That was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** That was great, dude.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** This true warrior does not know that, so he is going to do it anyways.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:27]** So he gets a minus 12, which ends up as a minus 4 from whatever I roll raw.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:30]** So let me do that.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** That is a miss.

**[00:51:34 - 00:52:00]** and that's an eight doesn't nope sorry that's a four does a four hit you no no no oh so close yeah oh man okay so this tough tough true warrior uh he's wait where was i wait yeah yeah okay you're right sorry i was i was getting flashbacks to that other episode where i screwed everything up i am the bottom of the list it is a tough true warriors there's a lot of true warriors on my list uh so tough true warrior he you know he's he's he's struggling

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** He's a little weak.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:10]** He's fighting defensively, so he did his knuckle drag or knuckle crack, and he pounds down twice, but he kind of just misses completely.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:15]** It's like trying to punch the root of a plant through the plant.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** It makes no sense.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** So he pounds the ground, and then that's the end of his turn.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** And that is the end of the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** End of the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** end of the round.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** So let's go through.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** It is now the true warriors turn on top.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** On top?

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** On top.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Yeah, on top of my initiative list.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Got it.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:34]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Which one is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** Is it the Yusoki over Yonder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** It's the first Yusoki kind of up to the northwest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** The one that's not doing very well.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Engaged in mortal combat with the K'vok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Yeah, and this time he's actually going to use a move action.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** He puts his gun back in his holster.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** He's a little more calm.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** He pulls out his baton.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Or no, sorry, his survival knife.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** And he's going to swing with his survival knife at the K'fok.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** It's like watching a mongoose and a python.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** It really is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Natural enemies.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Thank goodness for these K'foks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Man.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:17]** That is a natural 20, which is hilarious because it's a good sick of fuck.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** But I get to roll the damage twice.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** It's a D4.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** And add the bonus both times.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:30]** D4 plus one, so that's going to be two plus five plus two for a total of nine points of damage.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:41]** So, like, that guy got pretty beat up, but he takes a step back, he pulls out his knife, and he just stabs this thing right through the chin, whatever a chin is for a K'fok.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** And you just see its brains burst out from the top.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** And he yanks it back out.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:52]** And the Kefauk drops out and just falls out of the pile of junk.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Oh, man.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** That's the end of that Kefauk.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Oh, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:00]** What the viewers didn't get to see was Kevin's jacked forearm as he did the motion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** That Navy strength, man.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** It never goes away.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Yeah.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Video coming soon to see Kev's strength.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Man.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Sad to fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** And that's going to be that Yosuke's full turn.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** So go ahead, Torme.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** It is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:25]** Yes, Trebe is going seeing our would-be boss flee.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:32]** He's going to chase after her and attempt to cast Stumble.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Stumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Nice.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:44]** So you run up along, there's a wall kind of curving around into where the K'voks are, and you kind of strafe along that wall and then cast your attack.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** So that is a fortitude save, you said, or will?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Reflex.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Reflex save.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Third time's the charm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Man, I can't remember this so much.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** I believe you have a minus two on that.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Oh, from the shaken.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** From the shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** I think he actually is minus four from shaken and poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** It is a minus.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** It's a minus four, yes.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** I don't even know why I'm rolling.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** At 16, I got a 12 on the dice.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Wait, no.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Sorry.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** 16 on the dice.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Minus four.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** So I am at 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** It's a minus four plus the bonus.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** Because you got a plus three for your reflexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Yeah.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** So does a 15 pass?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Yeah.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** So completely negates it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** Stumble is... Not that great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Has Stumble worked once?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** No.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** It's a save or... What's it called?

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Like save or suck, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Or it's like... Save or suck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Yeah.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Is it a cantrip though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Yeah, it's a cantrip.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Just keep trying.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** I like it.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** It works.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** It's a nice attempt.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** I see what you're trying to do.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** But Thaddeus ran around the corner, so let's just skip him completely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** I can't even see Thaddeus on the map.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** I think Thaddeus is out.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** Thaddeus, by the way, can't see anything that happened.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** I can't as a player either.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** So then Thaddeus just kind of comes around the corner.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** He's like, ooh.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** So the fog of war has vanished for him.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** He sees now that Shaq is front of the silky, which is not wise.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:13]** So then he's going to shoot again with the Formian Venom Caster.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Nice.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Let's see how that goes.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** It's 14 to hit.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Does that hit?

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** It does.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** Because this guy's all kind of f***ed.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Take him out.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Nothing about the box.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** Here we go.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Five damage.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** And then I don't think the poison effect stacks, does it?

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:33]** Like if I shoot him again, does it like move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** If you're using poison darts, I really need to start checking your inventory.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** I don't know if I trust you on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** I think it would move them another step down the poison trail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:42]** I didn't have time to like change my things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:42 - 00:57:12]** well because we talked about this like you you can't like if you you shouldn't have your gun completely loaded with poison darts it's almost like a revolver so you should be able to like slide not what we agreed on though we agreed on pretty sure we're a poison you should make sure it's just one type of poison that you have well it was one of those things that these darts are i could i could look it up but are like four thousand dollars a pop or something yeah we did talk about you having to change the darts are not that much the poison the poison's expensive yeah right okay yeah but you can read you can use the poison to fuel up a lot of darts what's up john

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:18]** I think we did talk about how you would have to spend like a move accent or something to switch to switch types.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Correct.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:21]** But I haven't done that because I got to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** Do you have a bonus?

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** What is it?

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** A base attack bonus?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Because then you could do that while you're moving.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** I'll give you that.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** I'll give you the round.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:34]** So you go ahead, you shoot, go ahead, roll your, is it D8 of damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** It's five damage plus the poison effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** Five damage plus the poison.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** 14.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Fortitude.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I don't even need to roll.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Michael.

**[00:57:44 - 00:58:07]** um so again thaddeus with the kill he comes around that corner and he's like oh i can't really see what's going on but now i'm here so i raise my rifle and pull the trigger and that's that's my thaddeus impersonation that's a great impersonation yeah it's really good actually and it's awesome chalk is standing in front of them waving around like hey look at me

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:30]** me and the darts it's almost like chalk puts his hands up in a diamond and the dark goes to clean through the diamond shape of his leaves and just hits it's the the true warrior right in the chest and the true warrior even standing defensively with his plus two wait a second

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** What did you say your roll was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** It was 14 to hit, eight, five damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Oh, I take that all back.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** What?

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Because he was fighting defensively.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:42]** So he gets a plus two to his AC and he passes.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** And so he's standing defensively.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** He sees that dart coming at him and he kind of just dodges it.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:51]** Just turns, twists in a yoga pose, puts his shoulder up.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Dart flies past him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** It's Torme.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Torme dies instantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** It's rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** Sorry for misleading you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Chalk is your turn.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** Oh, wow.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** I'm so sad now.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Chalk looks up and says, Dodge this!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** That's his whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Not in the face again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Oh, no.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** He dodged that.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** That's an eight to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** Yeah, that's... Is that a regular attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** It's a ranged attack, so...

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** What is up with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** So he gets an attack of opportunity on you?

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Yeah.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Okay.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:35]** So he feels this thing whip across his leg, and he's like, what was that?

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Still at a minus four.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** He is at a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:42]** Actually, a minus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** I don't know if that counts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:46]** Well, definitely another minus two because of the shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** I'll give you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** No, no, no.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** That's Ted's.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:53]** No, it should be minus four because he's fighting defensively and minus eight for not in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** All right.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** And then there's an extra minus two because he, oh no, he did not pass his.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** It's fine.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Anyways.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** So it's a minus eight on the dice.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Yeah.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:02]** Yeah.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Yep.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** So it's a raw dice roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Basically.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** Does an 11 hit?

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** 11 does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** That's right.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]** So he feels the wipe across his leg and he kind of just backhands down and misses.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** He's just like swatting a fly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** He just like swats the rifle away.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** He looks up and says, you won't dodge the next one.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** And that's his nodding face.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:36]** Well, it is now the true warrior's turn.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Number two.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** Number two.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Number two warrior, number two.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]** He's going to take another guarded step back from the Kafak.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** He's out of sight.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** And take a shot.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:53]** So he's out of sight for you guys, but he is still engaged with the Kafak.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]** And he's going to roll to attack.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** And he misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Yes.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** And it's Tez Tronin's turn.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** And she does not look happy.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Is she just going to keep running?

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** She doesn't.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** She was backing up slowly from you guys.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** And you guys...

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** You guys have intimidated her.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** She is shaken.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:21]** She's looking at her tough true warrior having such a hard time with engaging you guys.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:25]** Her two Yusokis, like one of them finally killed the thing, but he's on the verge of death.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** She's just incredibly irritated and angry.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** She's going to take one more step back.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:40]** And then a blinding bright light bursts from her.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** You all shield your eyes.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** It's that bright.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** Even the tough true warrior closes his eyes and covers up.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:56]** And as that light fades away and you guys all slowly open your eyes again, you see that Tez Tronin is gone.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** What?

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:03]** The K'foks are dead, including the Ysokis that were near her.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:06]** They're all dead.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:07]** Oh my gosh.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:16]** And the pile, the column of junk that the one K'fok came out of is toppled over and she's gone.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:25]** And that tough true warrior standing over Chak goes, oh, you guys are in trouble now.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** What does that mean?

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:35]** It's going to be like freaking like teleporting around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** How are we in trouble now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** What?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** Tez, I hate you.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Sincerely, Rolo.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:46]** Reminder, Kevin made this fight.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** So just blame Kevin for how difficult this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** I made that fight from scratch.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:07]** Until next week, drift begones and distance stars.
