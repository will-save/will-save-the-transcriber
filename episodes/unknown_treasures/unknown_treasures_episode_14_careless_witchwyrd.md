## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** That's not an update.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:26]** You just said yes.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** We need to meet with our lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** You asked if I could.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** You didn't tell me to do that.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:32]** You just said I'm capable of doing so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:37]** You forget Kev is also a murder bot.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** You've got to be really explicit with him.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** You are a meowder bot.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** Okay, before we go any further, I know this is going to take a lot of time.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:53]** Vinny, I want to know all about your only ever trip to Los Angeles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** And this might get a little confusing because time frames, you're heading out to LA sooner or later.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** But I want to know about your first, I guess it's your first time to LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** Right.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** My first and only time in LA.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** I'm going to tag John in because he was also there for all of it.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** And this was a long time ago.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** This is what, 10 years?

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** 2012.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** How long ago?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** 10 years.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** 2012.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Yeah.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** 10 years ago.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:23]** Dude, flew from the East Coast to the West Coast, which...

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** That jet lag is really fun.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** Went to In-N-Out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Why did you come out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:34]** Oh, I came out because John was moving, I think.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** I remember loading your car up with a whole bunch of stuff and driving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:45]** So Andrew and John drove across the country and you flew out to meet them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** So I flew out to LA.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** We loaded John's car up.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:55]** and drove it from LA to Jacksonville, Florida, from the West Coast to the East Coast.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** To pick up Andrew.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** To pick up Andrew.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** And then Andrew and John drove back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Okay.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** That's where I'm confused.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** I was like, John was moving.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:07]** I didn't, John was moving to LA, but he was already in LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** I was just moving places.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** So I was just taking my stuff with me instead of putting it in the storage unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yeah.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** So we just took it from the West coast to the East coast and back to the West coast instead of just.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** So displacement was zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:19]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Net displacement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Went to In-N-Out for the first time.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** 5,000 miles in between.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** That was the first place we went, In-N-Out.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** I'd never been to In-N-Out before.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Unfortunately, it was too long ago.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** I don't remember how it was.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** Delicious.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** I also remember being exhausted for most of that trip.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** And we had brunch because it was about that time.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** Went to John's apartment, met Chad.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Shout out to Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** I met Chad.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** He's a cool dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Yeah.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Chad's golden.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Chad's golden.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** I miss Chad.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** I only met Chad once and I miss him.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Yeah.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** So we did that.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:56]** We packed some stuff up and then I had to go shopping because I did not bring appropriate clothes because

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:00]** Because John had a gig in Malibu.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** At the time, I was doing a lot of sound engineering work.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** So I pulled up to John's gig with him set behind the console.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** Yeah, we like literally had a gig and it was me and this singer named Rozzy.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:19]** And it was like for her label and they like brought like fashion people in and literally we were there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** Lauren Conrad was there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** No, I was just saying she was like, who's going to run sound?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** And I was like, you'll never believe this.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** But my friend Vinny runs sound and he's here.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:39]** And so you ran sound for the – this is again literally the – like you landed in the morning and this is like 2 o'clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** I need more.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:45]** So you showed up in what, and they're like, you can't wear that because we're fashion people, and they sent you away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:52]** I just remember flying in, and I knew he had a gig, but I expected to just be a wallflower, not in front of anyone.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:57]** And he was like, no, you're actually running sound, and it's going to be right next to the stage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** This is a work trip.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:04]** This is like a private Malibu home where it's just like right on the PCH, and you're just at the ocean.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** And it's just like a small party kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** There was no hiding.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** Like it was just stick out like a sore thumb, which I think I still did.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:19]** Cause it was like pastel beach wear shorts and t-shirts and I'm in like jeans and vans and.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** We literally play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** And you're seven foot tall, so you're like towering over people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** Right after we stopped playing, this tall dude comes in.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** And Vinny and I were chilling.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** And I think, Vinny, you noticed him first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** I did.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** I was like, is that John Mayer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** And I was like, no way.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** Like literally right after we stopped playing, and Vinny, this whole thing, he comes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** I distinctly remember this.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** I was like...

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** does that mean Katy Perry is going to be here?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Cause they were, they were dating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:57]** And then tabloids the next day, they broke up and he looked super salty at that party.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** I was like, cool.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** That's probably why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** That's probably why.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Do it too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** It's just crazy that you'd land and then go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:29]** run a show so we left from the party and went and drove out into the desert we literally drove and like had oh we had slater's 50 50 right slater's 50 50 i forgot about that dude okay this spot it's great the first time it it's okay the first time but it changed my life i have ripped this burger off in so many different ways

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:34]** Just because I love the concept of like half beef, half bacon burger patty.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:39]** Like bought a meat grinder so that I can make my own ground bacon.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** Nice.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:45]** Because they don't sell ground bacon and have been making my own like 50-50 burgers ever since.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** They're probably amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** They are pretty good.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** We got a barbecue with Vinny.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:53]** Yeah, I realize I talk a lot about barbecue on this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** When you're out here, you can borrow our barbecue kit here.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** Yeah, like whatever you want to do, wherever you want barbecue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Give me a shopping list, I'll pick something up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** Yeah, same.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** I'm sad I can't join you.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Yeah, well, you could if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Yeah, Kevin, you could come.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:14]** I won't recount the whole drive because it was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:23]** Oh, there was one moment where we drove, we left, the first night we slept in our car in like... Well, why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** Why did we sleep in your car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** Because we didn't want to go in the motel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:32]** No, we drove north into the desert.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** We stopped in Ludlow.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:38]** Pulled up to the sketchiest looking motel we have ever seen.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** Like straight up Bates Motel.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** Did not think we were going to survive the night because someone was going to murder us.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:52]** We walk up to the front door and there's a sign that says, go next door to the gas station to Bohemian Rhapsody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** That's right.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** I forgot about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:59]** We went to the gas station and he said they were all booked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** There were other cars getting gas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** This must have been the only motel for 200 miles.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** Yeah.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** So yeah, we car camped.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** It was like 102 at two o'clock in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** What the hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** Yeah, it was dumb how hot it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** It was like outside of Death Valley.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** What the fuck?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Where is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** Yeah, we woke up the next morning, saw the Grand Canyon, and continued through Kansas.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** Shout out to John's Cousins for showing us some good hospitality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** I just want to say we did drive from that horrible night's sleep.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** We were like, let's make it all the way to Colorado Springs.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** And we did.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** We did.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** At like four in the morning.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** We stayed at a Motel 6.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** We leave at 9 a.m.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** and we're like, let's hustle.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** Let's get to Kansas where we know we can chill in Lawrence with my family, right?

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** We go.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** We're cruising.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** We're seeing the farmland.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** We're having a good time.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:52]** Then we kind of hit that stretch in the middle where there's just nothing.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** It's just flat.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** You're just on the highway.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** And we pull off into one of those towns where you can see the town from the exit.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** It's just on both sides.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** That's the whole town.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** We pull off.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** We eat at a little cafe.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** It's cute.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** It's a good time.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** They're like, here's your check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** We were at the border of Kansas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** We were at the border.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** They're like, here's your check.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** I'm like, cool.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** I'm going to pay my half.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** And I'm like, Benny...

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** I don't have my wallet.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Oh, no.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** I called the Motel 6, and they were like, yeah, we found a wallet in the room this morning.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** The gas station?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** No, no.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** The one in Colorado Springs.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** It's two and a half hours away.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:28]** So we drove back from the Kansas border of Colorado, back to Colorado Springs.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** Yes.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** And then went on to Lawrence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:31]** Yes.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** Also, I got a ticket in Colorado Springs at 3 a.m.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** coming down the mountain, and a cop flashed us at the last second.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** She was really nice, though.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** You want to talk about the other speeding ticket you got?

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Oh.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Heading into Memphis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Yeah, we were outside.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:53]** We're trying to get to Memphis after we were in Kansas.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** And we're just pulling through.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:00]** And then, you know, we're driving through some nice, you know, Tennessee roads.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** And then we hear like whoop.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** pull over.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** This cop comes up.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:07]** He's like, hey, I noticed y'all got some California plates.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** You seem like you're pretty far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:14]** This dude, okay, you could like... Pretty far out of your lane, buddy.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:19]** We could hear like the spurs clanging as he walked up to the window.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** He sounded like Yosemite Sam.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** It was incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** Mustaches twirling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** He's like, hey, where y'all headed?

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Because he saw the Florida

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** like rendezvous.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:47]** We don't, you know, we'd been Googling some places, but he was like, yeah, I was like, how do we, you know, how do you spell it?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** You know, write it down for us.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** He was like, yeah, it's a R-E-N-I.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** However the hell you spell rendezvous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** It's great.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** He just cuts off in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Wait, did he give you a ticket in addition to giving you advice on where to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** So wait, he just pulled you over to harass you and find out where you were coming from?

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** I don't know how to spell rendezvous.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Get out of here.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:15]** I'm no lawyer, but I'd tell him to go, well, whatever.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** Yeah.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** And then we went to rendezvous and it was great.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** It was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Yeah.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Yeah.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** And I felt great.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** Like, once we hit Memphis, I was like, oh, I'm back in the South.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** Yeah.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** Have sweet tea again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Sweet tea, big hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** I'm so interested in the South, man.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:33]** Like, Vinny uses phrases that we just don't use here.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** And then, like, I just want to, like, explore the South, man.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** He does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** Drink a mint julep on a porch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** He said, if I had my druthers the other day.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** A mint julep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:49]** I'd be drinking a mint julep right now on my rocking chair.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** I think I got vapors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** I've only been to like... As well rocks in his rocking chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:59]** He's actually rocking right now.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** Well, I think we just need to do a show.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** We need to go record in the south somewhere.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:05]** Yeah, we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:16]** I mean, it might be worth just recording a road trip because I've had, I can't even count, I think three east to west road trips that have all been ridiculous for their own reasons.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:21]** And I've only had one trip from west to east.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:25]** Nope, I take that back because my wife and I just moved years ago.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** And that was a pretty crazy trip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** I did West to East and I did South to North.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Yeah.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** I've never done any of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:37]** There was the most memorable for me with a type about your like gas station experiences.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:49]** One time a friend and I went up to, or went down to a, um, we were in New Hampshire and we went to a Connecticut casino come to find out my friend probably shouldn't be gambling because he can't, he doesn't know when to stop.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** So he gambled for like nine hours and,

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** So we're both drunk at this point and like we finally get like it's two in the morning.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** They finally cut us off and like, hey, you guys should leave.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** We're like, all right, fine.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** We go to the hotel nearest us.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** We rode our motorcycles, by the way.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** We go to the hotel and they don't have any rooms.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** So what do the two of us do?

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:21]** We slept on our motorcycles for about six hours before going to Six Flags the next morning with our friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** Kevin, literally anywhere else would have been more comfortable in a motorcycle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** There was nowhere else to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Oh, you could sleep on a rock or something.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** The ground.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Yeah, the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:34]** I think that's where my friend, when I woke, I actually was able to get comfortable across my tank.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I took my jacket off.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** What kind of bike were you on?

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I was on my Ducati.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** I had my jacket over my tank and was huddling that.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** I was pretty comfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** You slept on a sport bike?

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** I don't get those logistics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** That was a fun trip.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** More than just a bike.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Anyways, we could talk road trips all day long.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** I think it is important, though.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** This show is not about road trips.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** It's about Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** I thought it was the friends you make along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Yeah, I thought about the friends you make.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** No.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** No, no.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** That's the real treasure.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** There's no friends here.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** That's the real treasure.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** That's terrible.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** You're all my colleagues.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Work associates.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** No.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** Work associates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** We keep it strictly professional on WellSaved.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Strictly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Yeah, strictly.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Strictly.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Who's contacting HR?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Are you guys ready to play?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** Or do you guys want to roll back?

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Are we talking about some levels?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Let me wrap up a little bit what happened last time.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:37]** You finished that fight with the Thestarian K'vok.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:41]** It was a brutal fight, but those tides were turned after we figured out the rules.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** Turns out environmental protections are a big deal.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:53]** You all made very short order of that thing after that, and Thaddeus finished it off with a bullet to the eyeball.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:11]** uh after that you leveled up so let's talk about leveling up yes let's start with you john you seem eager to tell us do you guys and i'll leave that option you can tell us what you leveled how you leveled or you can just you know say pass and move on and we can figure it out along the way so let's do it let's go john


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Wow, that's a good question.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** I don't think I've said what my class is.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** You could tell us, did you keep the same class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** You don't have to tell us what the class is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** I did keep the same class.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:23]** I did do an appropriate skill, you know, spread.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Yeah, I think I got some good things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** Do any of the other players want to guess his class?

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** I know the class because I'm the GM and I know everything.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** I feel like you guys probably know, but maybe you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:37]** I mean, you're going into the same class or you're double-classing or whatever it's called.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** I'm not multi-classing.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Multi-classing.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:44]** You're a Technomancer or the other magic one?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Mystic.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Which are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Close, but no cigar.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Close, but no cigar.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Will, you got a guess?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** No?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Solarian?

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** All right, moving on, John.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** You're not telling anybody anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Oh, what is it?

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** I have it in my head.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** I can't think of what it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:07]** It's the... For the listener, Vinny is pointing at his watch.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** I think Vinny's got it figured out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** I just can't remember what it's called.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** It's right next to Solarian in my head.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** It's kind of...

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** It's the time.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** You're the doctor, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Like the Doctor Who doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Sorry, not like the medical doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** You're David Tennant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** All right.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:32]** So our listeners, tell us what is Rolu's class.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** But from there, we're going to move on.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Vinny, are you ready to tell us about your levels?

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Do you want to tell us a skill, John?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Are you done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** I'm done.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** John, are you pre-cog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Yes.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** That's what it is.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Am I a precog?

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Yes, I'm a precog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Yeah.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Precog is such a, I've read through it.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** It's such a cool class.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** It's so fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Yeah, it's a really cool class.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:02]** But I will say that Rolu, if you haven't noticed, is like not trying to advertise that he's a precog.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:08]** He's not trying to, like, really, like, lean into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** So it's interesting if your characters know if he's a precogger or not.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:19]** Yeah, I would think that he hasn't done anything outwardly to try and, like...

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** Make that no.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** You casted some spells, though.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** Yeah, but those could just be... Depending on the spell, yeah.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Yeah.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:35]** I mean, like, your character might have their, like, suspicions, but he hasn't been like, yeah, so now that I'm just doing my little precognition thing, you know, like, I'm not saying that out loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Right.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** Yeah.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** It's just kind of funny to...

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** I think the only reason I know you're a precog is because I also wanted to roll a precog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** So you knew one of the skills he used and you're like, ah, I just think it's kind of funny.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:52]** Like, uh, like the idea that there are only what, 12 classes now total is originally six and they've expanded out.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I'm not sure what the number is.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:58]** Um, but like everybody in this world that is somebody, um,

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** is one of these classes.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** And like in the real world, it's not like that at all.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Like, you know, you find out somebody's job or whatever.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Like, I just think it's funny.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** And there's, and again, like, it's not like there's a rule book.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:16]** If I start talking about mechanical sciences and stuff and somebody doesn't pull open a rule book and go like, Oh, he's probably a mechanical engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:33]** because he's you he used that you know phrase right well anyways i think it's like a theme thing right like you would be maybe like a mechanic but your theme would be like scholar maybe or like engineer you know i don't know anyways uh chalk where did chalk go with his levels


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** I have not multiclassed.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Chalk is still an envoy.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** He's just an envoy two now.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:49]** And I am going to let his new ability come out when we go to use it.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** I think the party's going to be pretty excited about it, though.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** And yeah, I, I rolled envoy.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** I knew he was going to be tiny.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:08]** And so I expected him to end up filling more of a support role anyway, which like envoys are great facilitators for whichever group they end up being in.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** So yeah.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:16]** And he spent some time in the moments after killing the K'vok processing all of the language he's heard so far.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** So he got a new language in Akatonian.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Smart shot.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** Termay, do you want to tell us a little bit about your character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:29]** Termay is... I don't need to do his voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:38]** Yeah, Termay is a witch warper, and he leveled in Witch Warper.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Yeah.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:44]** And that comes with... It unlocks the Paradigm Shift.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:45]** Yes.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Yes.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Which I'm excited to try out.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Hopefully I get a chance.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** But I don't want to spoil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** I'm so intrigued by that.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:59]** I'll say that I got to play Witch Warper in one of our practice sessions.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** And between Precog and Witch Warper, I think those are two of my favorite.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:08]** Maybe not playing them, but concepts, the idea of those things are just so cool.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** And I like that Starfinder was able to roll them into a game.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** Thaddeus, what do you got going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:24]** Thaddeus is a soldier, and he doubled down on that so that he could just be better at fighting and also being proficient in a variety of weapons, being that he's a webs.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:32]** And also he gained some combat, one particular combat ability, which can help like kind of provide a boon during combat.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:37]** You know, those people that are like, gather round, tactical retreat.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:42]** You know, like he stayed in the fight and just like little phrases like that, that like kind of buff everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Is that a soldier thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** That's a soldier thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:49]** Like phrases are definitely a, a, um, envoys like domain.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** That's how they like boosting people.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** What?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** No.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Yeah.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Get, get them.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** And a lot of other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** Envoy might have them too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** Um, so I'm curious, I didn't know soldiers and I play a soldier, um, in our main game.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** And I don't know, but I went down a different path.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** I didn't know they had those kind of feats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** Yeah, they do.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** They do.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Bolster the troops.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:12]** I like how all of us, none of us said anything specific.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** Because we wanted to come up and game and surprise Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** That's fine.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:22]** I mostly want to say he or Kev loses marbles at everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** What?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** What?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Yeah.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** What?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** It's cool because I'm leveling up my characters too.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** What?

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** That's not how this works.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** No one cares.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** My dead Kefauk is now level seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** That's not how this works.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** Nobody cares.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** You just see like an animation on his dead body.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Yeah.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** It just like glows for like a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** Oh, sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** I think we should get into it.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Okay, let's get into it.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** You guys are all in this open field.

**[00:21:48 - 00:22:00]** Chak and Rolu and your shadow spider are actually really close to this kafak that is still radiating radiation, which is a funny... I think the shadow spider is probably gone now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Better give him a name.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Its name is Peter Parker.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** Peter Parker.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Oh, Peter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Peter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** Peter, you've become a pirate.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Thaddeus and Torme, though, are further away.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:17]** They're outside of that radiation and they are over near the entrance to this giant sea of sand.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:25]** On the opposite side of that sand is a hover truck that is damaged and flat to the ground.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:35]** One thing that you might have noticed while this is all coming down, the door cracks open and an android peeks their head out.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:40]** They have blue skin with gold circuits kind of glowing through their skin.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** And they have long green braids.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:48]** They stick their head out and they ask you, is it safe to come out now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Is the android wearing armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** They do have armor.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Is there a token?

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Sorry, I forgot about this.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** I was going to show you.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Let me see if I can find them.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** I'm so curious.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** Now that's an avocado.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Whoa.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** Great artwork.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** I know.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I love Starfinder artwork.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** That's so cool.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** But they are awesome looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:16]** Yeah, their eyes are like just the irradiance of the blue really stands out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** The hair, the type of green is really pretty too.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Nice braids.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** What's this like copper sort of chin strap or something that they have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** That's a part of their circuitry.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Oh, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** They've got some dope circuits.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:38]** Yeah, and they've got a very cyberpunk red jacket with the collar kind of popped up on one side and the green braids.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Kind of 80s looking.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Definitely 80s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:46]** As very 13, nobody responded to them.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** But they... Texas, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Depends on what you mean by safe.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** Because we asked her, where's your token so we can see what you look like.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** That's what we said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** Oh, that's what... Man, see, I'm such... Hold on, I gotta switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** I've never seen a dog eat avocados before.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** That's what I responded with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** They're still in the truck.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** They're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Oh, I thought they were getting out of the truck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** There we go.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** There's radiation out here.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** Unless you have something to protect yourself.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** You might want to hold off a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:19]** Yeah, they reply, oh, I've had my environmental protections on this whole time.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:47]** about it are you very 13 i am very 13 yes and they they look very disheveled very dirty um and they they also kind of comment like they're they are very tired very hungry are you feeling okay are they hurt they are not they're at full health okay dope roll is gonna walk up and say how did you get in this situation and that's her sorry their face kind of drops um

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:58]** I came here with him, and they point to Lorgan, who's dead on the ground.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:09]** As we came in, we realized we were being followed by some group, and we were finally confronted a ways back, and Lorgan happened to kill one of them.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** But we got away from them.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:18]** But as we came into this area, another one followed us and confronted us.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:22]** But that is when we were attacked by that giant sand creature.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** I owe my life to both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Very.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** Which one of these followed you in?

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Is it this one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** There's two dead bodies on the map.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:37]** I'll say that this one is Lorgan and the one to the right is the true warrior.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** And as we mentioned, both of them were pointed at something.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:44]** So you can assume that they were fighting the K'vok together.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:50]** Like they might have been confronting each other, but the K'vok was a bigger danger and they both lost their lives to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:59]** Tremei is going to go over and touch the true warrior and cast a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** Grave words.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** That's dope.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** Go ahead and read what grave words does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:14]** You can force a touched corpse to talk to you, but you can't ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** The corpse utters random sentences for one round.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** With a 10% chance, this information is of some use to you.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:34]** Useful information might include warnings about dangers in a wrecked starship, the password to unlock a computer, or the name of a supernatural creature seeking you or your allies.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:42]** The GM makes the percent roll in secret and decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:50]** You kind of reach out, you touch, and this glow, it passes through the body.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** You almost hear a gasp, and the lips start to move.

**[00:26:53 - 00:27:02]** It is definitely a corpse speaking, but you hear this dead true warrior say, just tell me what you're looking for, and I'll let you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Ah, what is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** And then the body falls asleep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** Sounds about right.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Yeah.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Cool.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** That was a 10% chance.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Yeah, you didn't make that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** I don't know what information I would have been able to give you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Who knows?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** You're the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** You didn't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** There's five more coming for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Cast it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** It's a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Yeah, it's strange.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:36]** It can only be cast once per 24 hours on the same creature, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** That is a cool cantrip, though.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Yeah, it's a really neat cantrip.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** Go ahead and roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Anyone in particular?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Everybody, kind of.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** 18.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** 22.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Man.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** All right.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** So you guys all see it.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:58]** You notice that there is a drunk, a drunk, there's a drunk drone, a junk drone.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** It's partially buried near this hover truck.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** And it, and it seems like Friday 13 didn't even notice it.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** You know, they were such a scramble to get into the truck.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** And now that they're out of the truck, they didn't really figure that out.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:22]** And actually, I'll say that Rolu, you're closer to the truck, and you kind of see into the truck a little bit as the door opens, and there's just stale cigarettes in the cup holder, and there's a fire extinguisher underneath the seat.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** The gauge on that would show that it's full.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** The fire extinguisher's full?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Yeah.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** I'm going to take the...

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Well, I'm going to help very 13 out of the truck.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:36]** Then I'm going to take the fire extinguisher out.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:44]** And also, can I do an engineering check just to see if there's anything or like a perception to see if there's anything about this truck that's unusual or if it's just junk that's here.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Yeah, roll an engineering check on it.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** Okay.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Ooh, I rolled a natural one, so I have no idea.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Yeah, it's a truck.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Is this truck stable?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** Are we at risk of it just rolling down this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** You can kind of see on the map, there's a ridge here that's very tall.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** It's actually straight up, and the truck is kind of against it.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:09]** Yeah, just from the look of it, though, it is old, disheveled.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** I think I read a description of it before.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** The words on the side are sun-beaten away, completely bleached out.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** So, yeah, there's not much left to it.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** But yeah, one thing to note is that it is a hover truck.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** It's definitely not hovering anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** Jermaine's going to walk over to the truck.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:31]** Can I do like an engineering check to see what's like busted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:31]** Sure.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:31]** Yeah.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Go ahead.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Roll an engineering check for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** It'd be cool if we could just drive it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Float around.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Okay.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Okay.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** 20.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** All right.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** So you can, like from that, you can see like,

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** The gauge reads full.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:49]** The Thestarian that's in it, the tank, though, is empty.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** It is a Thestarian truck.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** The hover truck was delivering Thestarian, which makes a Thestrian, sorry.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Thestarian is whatever.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** You know, words are hard.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:11]** This truck was basically a transporter for the material that was used in pre-drift drive engine space engines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** And it's got no fuel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:18]** Well, the gauge reads full, but, you know, as an engineer with a high engineering check, you know that it's pegged at full.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:26]** And there's a hole in the tank where clearly this kevac was feeding.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Mm.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Got it.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** But everything else you notice on the truck, it was probably a fully capable truck.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Whatever reason, it stopped hovering.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:41]** And now it was just abandoned and then became food for this Kvok that is now dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** I'm just wondering if I could repair it and drive it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:47]** No, it's 200 years old.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** There's no way you're going to get that thing running again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** Even if I restore 1d4 hit points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I have mending too.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** So with our powers combined, I think we can do it.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Dang it.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Why didn't we coordinate this better?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Well, we can maybe lemon law.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** That's fine.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Can I do an engineering check on the drone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Oh, no.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** The drone, yes.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Is that the full?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** I don't know if it's just a picture.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** That's all the details too.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Is that a firearm?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:19]** Junk drone is a collection of, yeah, it's basically a turret of some sort.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** Let's see.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Do we have to be a mechanic to use it?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Man, I don't know.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Asking a lot of questions.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:31]** Fashioned from half-completed motors, rusting servos, and a bit of garbage, this non-flying device.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I'm going to point that out.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** It's got legs.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** It cannot fly.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:39]** Even if it's meant to, it does not have that ability in this region.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** Oh, when activated, you control it as if it were a first-level mechanic.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** As if you were a first-level mechanic.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** So it must be usable.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** As if you were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:52]** Is this Bernice's Akitonian cousin?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Yes!

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Oh, it kind of looks like a briefcase.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** It looks really cool, though.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** It looks like a...

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:22]** rusted like rusted scrap parts and like springs kind of put together for what four legs and then a this turret on top that looks like it looks like a pillbox yeah it's like it reminds me of those old modules planetariums before they started using projectors yes yeah that they would shoot the light out of yes yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:25]** so that is, that is yours to do what you want with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:29]** Um, we're going to watch, you know, do dark side of the moon star.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** Uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Nightlight stars.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Go ahead.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** Roll me a life science check on the fuck.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Just make sure it's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Really?

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** Yeah, I'll do that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Did we establish that nobody has life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** I actually added it, so I can.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Kelly.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** I have it, but it's not very hot.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I rolled...

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** A 17 for a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Cool.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** All right, that is enough.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:07]** You know that this carapace of the Thestron K'vok might be worth selling, similar to other K'voks.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:11]** The actual outer shell is worth some money.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:22]** The problem is that this K'vok is radioactive, and so it might take a little more work to convince a buyer that it's worth more, but that's up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Is the meat radioactive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:26]** The meat actually, as soon as this thing dies, the meat starts to decay away.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** And it's gross, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** It's gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Yeah, it almost turns to mush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Radioactive Kefak dogs might be a unique delicacy.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Might be too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:43]** So, I think Rollo's going to turn to Vary13 and say, we've been looking for you.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:50]** Your former contact, Riddle, expressed concern about your well-being and hadn't heard from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** Thank you, Triune, for delivering these warriors.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:00]** I was very scared, and I know that Riddle would take care of me.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** I'm very gracious for her.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Can we get out of here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** Yes, follow close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Did you find what you were looking for?

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** I did.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:12]** That escape pod over there, and they point to the escape pod that's to the south.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:18]** I can explain that all later, but I would like to get out of here first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Did you collect what you need from it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** Yes.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Yes, I did.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Thank you.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** And they step closer towards Rolu.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** He's been the most inviting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:29]** Jack is going to step up and extend a vine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Hi, I'm Jack the Rexalite.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** It's a pleasure to meet you.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** And they grab your vine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Apologies.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** We didn't introduce ourselves.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** I'm Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Rolu.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** Termaiden, but you may call me Termay.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Termaiden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** He leans over and whispers, he's a bit of a square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Thaddeus, don't be rude.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Thaddeus is just way off the distance.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:54]** He's like, hey, I'm Thaddeus.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** We saved your a**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** Very 13 awkwardly waves from the distance.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** He likes guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** Don't mind him.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** He can be thorny.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** He's just on Overwatch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:12]** One of Thaddeus' fangs just glints in the sunlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:37]** so can we head out let's boogie check looks up and says do you mind i expect that we might run into somebody though given there's a true warrior here does anyone need to heal before we move on in case we encounter something else or are you all ready to move i mean we can't make it we can't make a day of it i guess i could do a 10 minute we we have a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:36:01]** what the fuck are they called med kit stem packs i don't know yeah med med whatever is like so i'm just saying you mean just healing serums healing serums weps is just saying if singular if anyone really really really needs to do it now's the time to do it i need to do maybe a 10 minute rest okay let's take it now and then move on i was gonna ask a question to very


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** to them.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Okay.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Very deep.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** Why do you think these true warriors were these hooligans were after you and Logan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:24]** I, I am not certain, but I will tell you all of this when we get back to junkers delight, but I, I am onto something big and I, I think they may have learned that and they might be trying to take my secrets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Good to know.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** Rest up and we'll move on.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** We'll make sure that you get back safely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Thank you.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:33]** Before we leave, can I search the cabin of this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** We already did.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** The cabin had just stale cigarettes and the fire extinguisher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** And I took the fire extinguisher.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Oh, it's just fuel truck.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** That's right.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** For pre-state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:52]** While you guys are doing that 10-minute rest, after that 10-minute rest is over, very 13, they come over and they tell you all, the group together, and they say like...

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** I just want to thank you for what you're doing, but we need to be careful.

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:11]** So Look Alive out there, and they are going to use the Look Alive feat, which they burn a resolve point, and you guys each gain plus two morale bonus to perception and initiative checks for the next hour.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Plus two to what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** perception and initiative checks.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Cool.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** So can we just start heading back the same way?

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** Yeah.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** You kind of don't have any other route.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:31]** You're like I said, there's that the, the, the map looks flat, but it's actually raised up several, you know, uh, I'll say 20 feet high ledge and just doesn't seem like there's a way out that way.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** So it's easier to go back to where you came.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** Um,

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** So let's go ahead and move that way.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** You kind of come around that edge and you get back to that.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** We talked about this, the cavernous area.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** That's very sharp.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** I'm going to need each of you to roll an athletics check.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:49]** Very will lead the way they rolled high enough that they don't take any damage from it.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** 25.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** They were also the one to cause this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** So yeah, pretty much 15.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Dang it.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** Eight.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** I had the worst time coming through this last time, and I'm not any better this time.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** Why can't you squeeze through these little spaces?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Dude, you can't.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** I mean, you really can't.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** Did a 15 not make it?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Hold on.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** I'm trying to look, man.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** I thought it was like DC 10.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** It's 16 athletics check.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Are you kidding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** Wow, that's a high athletic check to not get cut.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** All right, well, Rolu gets cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Actually, no, I'll take that back.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** There was 16 coming through.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** This time I'll lower it to... I don't know what you guys rolled.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** I wasn't listening.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** This roller will lower it to 12.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** So if you got less than DC 12, you have to take one D6 of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Check passes.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** I got a 15, but... Yeah, I'll let a 15 pass.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** I got less than 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Rolu, are you serious?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Are you having trouble there?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Looks like you're taking some damage roll.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** How much did you take?

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Do I roll the d6, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Oh, are you the only one?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** I'll roll it for you if you want.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** That's only one point of damage.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** I'm fine.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** I'm fine, Thaddeus.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** I appreciate the concern, however rare it may be from you.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Always concerned about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** Seems to be a theme, but who am I to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:27]** i was clumsy so you guys all make it through this crevice rollo's the only one to take even the slightest bit of damage um but now that you're on the other side i am going to ask you to roll initiative what what god just just to make it easy because you know we're going back through the nest i'm not saying you have to get into combat there are ways around this spot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** You want us to be in an initiative order in general.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** Six for the monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Six for the monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** That's with a plus three?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Or plus two?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** That's with a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** Yeah, I rolled a two on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** Nice.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Woof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Woof indeed.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:43]** He was enthralled by Ferry 13's green hair.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Oh my god, really?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** 19 for Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** 16 for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Rolu got a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:52]** Seven.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** All right.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** And I'll let you know Vahri got an 11.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** So let me modify all these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** The literal battle music just came on, by the way.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** So it's not battle music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** You're not in battle yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Okay.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:09]** Thaddeus is going to quickly shout, like, everyone, I just moved stealthily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** You got it.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** I think I might go scout ahead to see if there's anybody waiting for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** And check.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Stealthily, Emble's over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Let's check first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Oh, wait.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** I forgot we were actually in initiative order checks last.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** I think Will's first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** All right.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** So go ahead, and we're going to start just going down initiative order to get back through.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:36]** So just for the listener, we are going back around that corner into where the two pyramids of K'vok nests are.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:43]** They're just chassis stacked up in almost perfect squares into a ziggurat kind of structure structure.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:54]** And we know from prior experience that this is where the K'foks live and nest, and they're almost throbbing with life because the small K'foks are eating and digging.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** They're what?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** It says...

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** They're throbbing with life?

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Throbbing.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** Yeah, the ziggurat as a whole is kind of... Thrumming.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Thrumming, thrumming, whatever.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** I'm bad with words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** And it's built out of junk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** It's junk, but it's moving just a little bit.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** Because there's thousands of these tiny K'voks.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Tiny, tiny, tiny.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** And I'm not talking tiny in Starfinder.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:21]** I'm talking minuscule, half an inch thick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Babies.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Babies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:40]** it's only until they get to a small size they become a threat so go ahead and take your move actions you can do whatever you need to to get through them who's first the first person to go is going to be Termay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:45]** Okay, Treme is going to come up to the edge stealthily.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** So I suppose I have to roll a stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:52]** I'm going to have you roll a stealth for every full move you make.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:55]** So if you're going to do two moves, I need you to do two stealth checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** I'm doing one move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Oh, you're not going to move twice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:05]** Okay, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, I'm going to be like, hey, guys, do you think we could distract them perhaps?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Clever.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Clever girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** And then...

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:14]** So his first movement is going to do that.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:20]** And then off the top of the ziggurat, I'm going to like find some one bulk item.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** Perhaps I think I can move up to one bulk.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** That doesn't say with what psychokinetic hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Okay, cool.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** One bulk.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Yeah.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:39]** And it is, I would like just push it off the top and maybe onto the backside of

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** Of the ziggurat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Just nudge it over the edge.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Yeah, I'll let you do that.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Cool.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:51]** And then maybe that would distract them from swarming onto us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** So that is your full turn.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Yeah.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** It is now Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:59]** Can I move twice when I'm in stealth?

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** You can.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Possible.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Yeah, I'll let you move.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Yeah, you have to roll a stealth for each move action.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** Well, it's 11, and I'm going to move 60 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** You have to roll twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:15]** So it's 11 for your first move, and then it's going to be... Got you, got you.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:20]** I think I'll roll again here probably, and then more stealth roll.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** That's a 19.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I'm assuming that's good.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** I'm really taking up the Vanguard here.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Let's hope I don't get...

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Yeah, I don't care.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Probably about here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** Okay, cool.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** So Thaddeus creeps his way along.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** We haven't seen anything yet, but we are in initiative order, so keep that in mind.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:51]** It is now Vary 13's turn, and Vary 13 is going to move up right behind Tremay, and that is going to be their full turn.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Okay.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** So it is now Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** Rolu's going to move up also.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Right behind first.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Right behind Treme.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** And I will do a stealth check.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Stealth roll.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Don't fail me now.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** 13.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Okay.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:14]** And then I'm going to keep moving to support Thaddeus.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:22]** And I would like to move to probably here next to just like around the bend, right?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:28]** So I came up on one side of the bend and I can just make it to the other because I was last coming out of that crevice.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** So I'm going to do another roll.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Ooh, 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** 11.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** All right, so Rolo's moved twice.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:38]** I got your stealths in mind.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Chuck, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:46]** Chuck is going to move up to very 13.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** I'm going to hold option so I can move to this corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Let me just rewind a bit.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** You guys can see that Kafak on the map, right?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Yeah, the one on top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Okay, that Kafak exists.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** It is there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** That's not just an artifact of the old one, of the last battle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** No, no.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:04]** That is a live, living Kafak.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Cool.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** On the second Ziggurat, kind of on the north side of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Has it been alerted to us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** You don't know yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Yeah, I don't think we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** He was in the last battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** I'm going to roll stealth for that first move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** He's a veteran.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** Yeah, he just didn't attack last time, so hopefully it doesn't sense this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:28]** That's a one on the die for a total of 11?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** No, eight.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** For a total of eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Okay.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** That's for your first move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** That's for my first move.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:41]** I'm going to use a free action to turn to very 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** You're safe with me.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** I'll keep you safe.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** As he climbs on their shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** I thought about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** I didn't want to do it without consent.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:58]** Always get consent if you're going to climb on someone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:02]** Yes, that's really good advice.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** Before you put your vines on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:10]** And I'm going to use one of my envoy improvisations.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** This did not take long.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:23]** for um that is termaden right next to me i think yes i'm going to use my envoy improvisation coordinated reload

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Nice.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** So as a move action, hey, get ready.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:35]** I can draw my weapon and I basically give him a bonus move action to draw or reload his weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** So that he can draw and fire in the same turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** Reloading.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Reloading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Nice.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** So amazing.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Reloading.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** But he whispers it because they're right next to each other and trying to be stopped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Reloading.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** Cool.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** It is now the Kafak's turn.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** The one you can see.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** The one who can't see us.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:00]** Can you give us some flavor of what triggers?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** I don't know.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:07]** So this Kafak, and mind you, these six seconds are all happening at the same exact time.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Yeah.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:15]** Chak stumbles and trips and then uses his vines to pick him up and set himself right.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:22]** And that catches the K'Vox senses, and it turns towards the group back there.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** It sees you.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:28]** And then the junk falls on the other side from Termay.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** And so it charges towards the group.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** And I'll move it.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Boop, boop, boop.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** And it's going to come up right here.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** And then it turns back.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** K'Vox got some hops.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:41]** And it's actually going to step away and look towards the junk that fell.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** Oh.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** And that's the end of round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:49]** Thaddeus is just gesturing emphatically like, get the fuck out of here.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Move, move, move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Go, go.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Top of the round.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Round number two.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Termay, it's your turn again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:01]** Termay is going to do the same program and see if it works.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:10]** The junk, more junk is going to come off, I would say, more towards the north this time from where I indicated the last time.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** So the sort of...

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:31]** northernmost corner of the ziggurat just gonna have a piece you know like fly off into the canyon wall see if it can draw the attention i'll try to make it bounce with enough force so that it rattles you know maybe against the ziggurat and the canyon wall


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** I'm actually going to say roll a will save for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** It's like a strength check, but you're using your mind for it.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** So I kind of want to see if it can bounce.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** Because you're only allowed to lift something one bulk.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:46]** So I'm going to say if you're trying to force it to move, I want you to kind of put an oomph to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:52]** It has to be like you can propel an object 15 feet in any direction.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Okay, fine.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** My will is zero, so 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Nice.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Okay.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Yeah.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:05]** It doesn't, like, jump across, but it definitely hops and then slams down.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Nice.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:10]** And actually, like, almost like a slinky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:18]** And then I'm going to stealthily move 30 feet of my movement and get maybe there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Okay.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** So I roll for stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Yes, please.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** 12?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** All right.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:36]** So you kind of squeeze past between the wall and the ziggurat, and then you've got to pass Rolu, and you kind of grab him by the shoulders and slide past him.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** And it's Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** Thaddeus is going to roll stealth again and move on to the swampy sort of area.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** We're back on top of those platforms now where we're crossing.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** That's a 13.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:55]** And then I'm going to move over here, and then he's also going to equip his...

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:59]** re-equip his squad Aegis series and take off his environmental protection suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Is he going to equip his what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** Because I don't think those things... He's going to re-equip his squad Aegis series armor and take off his environmental protection suit.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** I don't think they can be worn at the same time, as far as I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** I'm not sure about that.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** That's it.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** And then he gestures emphatically again.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Let's go, guys.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:38]** silently just like waving his hand i'm trying to distract it uh cool that is that's awesome uh it is now vari 13's turn they are going to move towards rolu and kind of get in between rolu and termay okay back around that corner let me roll stuff it's passing ish


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** What is passing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** None of your business.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:53]** And then they are going to move one more time and try to catch up with Thaddeus.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** And then we roll another stealth.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:59]** Okay.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** That is the end of Vahri's turn.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** Rolu, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:17]** I think as Rolu came around the corner and started to turn south, it was probably right when Terme sent another piece of junk flying, and Rolu maybe didn't realize that because he just saw the K'fok, so he thinks there was something else.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:23]** So he gets a little tense, and then he feels Terme's hands trying to move by him.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** He's like...

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** He gets, like, a little spooked as Tormek goes past and then calms down and sees Thaddeus waving.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** So Rolo's going to keep moving.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** He's going to move once and try and stealthily move.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** That is a 14.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Okay.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** That's going to be... Where is that?

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** Probably right behind Vahri.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:44 - 00:52:05]** behind them and then so vari vari and rolu are now like right at the start of the metal walkways yeah over the toxic river and i think rolu's gonna stay there he's gonna want to okay keep things spaced out he's gonna turn back make sure that termay and chak can get out of there without drawing more attention isn't chak on very 13th


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** I don't think so.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** No, he said he was not.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** All right.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Speaking of Chuck, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** Chuck is deeply uncomfortably being left behind by the rest of the party.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Good job, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** It's all happening at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Right.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Chuck, catch up, man.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** Chuck.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Let's take some measurement.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:36]** I've got 30 feet of movement, so if I double move, I can basically get to... Oh, yeah, for sure.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:40]** The same square as... I can get to, like, this square.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** Right past.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Yeah.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** Cool.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** I'm going to double move Chuck like Scooby-Doo tiptoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:47 - 00:53:13]** i like that he's like he's tiptoeing but he's kind of raised up a little bit because it's his vines that are actually moving him so he's like in the air uh that is a 24 okay and no whammies no whammies no whammies that's a nine it's a two on the die it's a nine so go ahead and move your character


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** Um, yeah, hang on.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Let me take that measurement one more again.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:28]** So to get to here was 24 to get from here to here was a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Are you, you're on, sorry, I'm just looking at the map.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:35]** You're, are you on the metal walkway or are you on the stone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** I'm on stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** I would have crossed the metal walkway, but I went stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:52]** So Kreek has crossed the metal, you kind of settle on the stone, and it is now the visible K'vok's turn.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** And that K'vok, it watched Vahri.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:03]** Like, it saw the stuff falling on the other side, and it was concerned, but it...

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:08]** Its eye was focused on Vahri as they passed, and then Chalk passed.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Or sorry, Rolu.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** It was actually Rolu that had the lower, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** No.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** Rolu had a 14 self.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Somebody had a pretty low roll.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** It was Chok.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** I don't remember.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Okay, it was Chok then.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:26]** So cop between these two, it has to decide, and it actually starts to turn back towards the group.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** And it's going to climb down.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:34]** It's actually going to climb back up and dig into this metal.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** So I'm going to hide it.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** It dives into that metal.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** It is now the start of round number three.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** And as that round starts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** Did anyone notice that?

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Like it burrowing in?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** I think Treme would have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Yeah, Treme definitely saw it.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** He's standing there like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:54]** Treme's like against the wall trying to like not move.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Kind of like T-Rex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:05]** I picture it like is it Gronk from Emperor's New Groove where he's up against the wall and he It's working though.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:14]** Treme is doing a great job of like Draxing it and like staying still and he sees this thing dive into the metal and as the thing dies in the metal we start round number three

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** And I'm going to show you something else.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** I'm so scared right now.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Monster appears.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** I'm so, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** K'fok number two.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Yeah, naturally.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** Is investigating all of the rubble that had fallen from Treme.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Treme threw all that stuff kind of to the north.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** And K'fok number two was actually scurrying towards that stuff.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** What's this K'fok's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** This is K'fok number two.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Oh, okay.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** You can call it two for short.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Yeah.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** They don't have minds, so no names.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Yeah.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** So it gets that metal.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:57]** It realizes it's just metal, and then it's going to turn back, and it's going to start moving towards the other one.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** And it's going to get to here, and that's when it sees Treme.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** It locks eyes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:09]** How did it see me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** We sprung the trap.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** That's how.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Well, I say we.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** I sprung the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Yeah, you did roll less than a ten.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** Was that what was necessary, Kev, to roll less than a ten?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Man, it's bulls**t. I don't know.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** I'm making this up as we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Come on.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.
