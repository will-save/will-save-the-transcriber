**[00:00:02 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:14]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:16]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:31]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:34]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:02]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:03]** I'm Kevin, your GM.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:04]** This is Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:07]** Yes!

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** Yeah!

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** Boom, boom, boom.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:11]** Possibly the sun is setting on Unknown Treasures, right?

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** At some point.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** It's winding down, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:18]** The deeper we get into this adventure, the less known the treasures are.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** That's very true.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:22]** I thought we already established those are the friends that we make along the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** I feel like it's John's thing that he stole probably, that blue thing.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:28]** Ooh, let's save that for the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** I have no idea what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** That's interesting.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Literally have no idea.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** Let's revisit that in Blood Armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Or in like five minutes.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** We'll see what Daddy's supposed to do.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** Just give it to us, man.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** You've never asked that before.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Just give it to me.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** I just want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** Why do you have to make everything weird?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** I was just saying, just give the party your blue thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** Give it to me.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** Kevin, he won't give me the box.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Ronu's being an ass.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Children, children, children.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Oh guys.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** Speaking of children, I just, it's probably not going to be as funny as it is in my head.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:09]** Cause I was there when it happened, but like all the neighborhood kids were out and about.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:14]** And one of the older kids came up and just like run in her mouth.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Cause that's what kids do.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** And she was just like, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** And then somehow it came up to like,

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:25]** Why is the G in giant make the J sound?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Why is it a giant?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** And we were having the discussion.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** And then a giant truck.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Do you guys know what giant is?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** It's a grocery store.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** Superstore?

**[00:02:35 - 00:03:02]** yeah yeah yeah so a giant truck rolls by and parks to deliver food to one of our neighbors while we're having this conversation it was like look a guy at truck and we're all going on about that and then we start talking about other things other other g words like giraffe you know just a large long neck right a gif and then the the little girl that was arguing it was like well my sister's not gonna like that show blah blah and we're like oh you mean majin

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:26]** majin's gonna argue that g's are always make the j sound because her name is megan anyways that's that's my story i'm glad it was so much funnier than i thought right yeah yeah yeah you really showed that kid taught them a lesson i'm sure the kids thought it was really funny i thought it was hilarious did anyone else laugh kev yeah all the adults were laughing it was funny yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** The delivery is always best in the moment.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** You know what I mean?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** I know.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** I feel like... I should have recorded it.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Next time it happens, I'll just put my phone out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Yeah.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** It won't be awkward at all.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** It's a secret to all the problems.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** Just record everything, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Yeah, just record your life.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Replay it when it's funny.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** Hey, let me share this joke with you on a phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** You know what I really want to do though?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:57]** I want to like have like a recording thing whenever we meet up with Kevin in person and just record him ranting about everyday life stuff and then just make a compilation of that as like a thing that we can play in a future episode.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** You know, like 10 minutes of just Kevin ranting about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** You make me sound like I'm just a whiny b****.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** No, it's not like that.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** John's going to bleep that and I'm going to be like, what the fuck?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Why is John bleeping me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** Not at all like a whiny bitch.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** You're more like a Bill Burr-esque kind of thing where it's like funny.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** You know what I mean?

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:14]** It's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:19]** Your rants are legendary and they are mostly targeted at Philly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** I rant about Philly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** Which is really funny because Kev is also redheaded and currently in New England.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Is Bill Burr from New England?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Is he in New England?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** I think he's in LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** He's from Boston.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Didn't he sell?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** I don't think Maryland's in.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Where is he from, though?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** He's definitely from the east.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** He's from Boston.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** Kelly ran into so much about Philly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** Wait, when are you going to Philly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** Like two weeks from now or whatever.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Just for like four or five days.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** That's cool.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Interesting.

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:12]** yeah if you guys want to chill i don't know how yeah i could come see i'm in the middle if you guys want to chill you guys can all just come to maryland the thing is like i'm gonna be with my friend slash co-worker so i need to make sure i'm fair to him time wise but like i want to like he's not gonna come down it's cool oh yeah no he's looking to come here

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:39]** i'm currently working with a school very near philly that's trying to get me to come up and do some training so sweet that could work out very nicely maybe i need to do that in a couple weeks i think you do i'm down i'm gonna coordinate with you guys about it because like i would love to see you it's been like i just have to turn it back and just say i i don't think you're a whiny no you're not per se what i think is that but is he not whiny or is he john's going up river now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Yeah, on purpose.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** Because the thing is that we all have our rants.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:50]** You just tend to have them a lot about things that people are like, I've never ranted about that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** So why would somebody rant about it?

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** It never occurred to me to rant about that in my lifetime.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** That's why it's funny.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** So different.

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** I'm not sure.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** I can't even bring up an example.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** What's an example of something I rant about that is not worth ranting about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** Nuclear power is one of them for sure.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** That is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** That is protecting the universe.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** Right now the world is collapsing because we don't need nuclear power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** It's a good thing we're recording this for the compilation.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Sorry, keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:23]** Wait, so again, nuclear power is not good because?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Nuclear power harms the environment, right?

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Oh yeah, it's bad, right?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** Because it blows up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** There's all that waste.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** And the waste gets in the water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** And the water gets into us.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Kevin, here's the thing.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Just one accident, one... Sorry.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Sorry, Gajon.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** One time is enough for everything to get f***ed, right?

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** There's been three massive accidents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Well, there's been two and a half massive nuclear accidents.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Yeah, Chernobyl and Fukushima.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:59]** And yet the death toll on those accidents is still lower than any other form of electricity, including hydropower and dams, because those dams collapse and flood entire villages and cities.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:03]** So we can go on and on about this, about how nuclear power is the safest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** What about gravity batteries?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** You guys heard about those?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** The ones that explode and burn?

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Those are dope.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:14]** The ones that explode on top of the... Oh, is this a potential energy thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** Yeah, store potential energy in abandoned mines.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Oh, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** That's what they do for some energy in Northern California, right?

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:27]** They've got, like, for water, they've got all this water stored uphill, and then they bring it downhill for energy.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** They use electricity to pump it uphill.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:35]** What would you do if your favorite Batman came out against nuclear power?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** Who would you cut first, nuclear power or Batman?

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** Like, my favorite actor?

**[00:07:40 - 00:08:02]** sure favorite actor playing batman i'm just picking batman because you have big opinions on batman what if batman himself came and said it to you right yeah that's easy you would easily just dump that actor because there hasn't been any good batman actors to begin with but what if comic book batman like materialized and he's like i'm bruce wayne i have this new technology or


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:25]** that wayne enterprises will make if if a writer writes a comic book where batman says nuclear power is wrong he is supposed to be the smartest man on earth and yet he thinks nuclear power is bad point i don't know that writer needs to get fired and that book needs to be burned before it's printed what if in the deadpool 3 movie they say nuclear power sucks

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:30]** You mean kind of like how Wolverine Origins had Deadpool come out of a nuclear reactor?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** Oh.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Yeah, the movie was trash.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Absolute trash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** That I agree on.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:39]** One thing that I realized that I shouldn't be rant about is the height of Wolverine.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** Because that, for Kev, is the reason why.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Oh, that's another thing that he rants about.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** That's the thing.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:46]** It's all the comic book stuff.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** It's even a fictional world in here.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** You're like, I don't rant about anything.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** Hugh Jackman's too tall to play him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** I never said that actor was too tall for a certain role.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** His CR is way too low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:02]** Kev looks like he's about to step up out of his rocking chair off his porch.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** He's about to do laps around the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Every single one of us.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I can see it through his headphones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:12]** I'm just boosting up the HP on this gray that you guys almost killed.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Oh, she's back alive and ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Oh, wow.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Just make sure you tell us and we'll be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Yeah.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** Oh, man.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** Where did she get these 18 healing serums from?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** She has three attacks on each turn and she gets two turns around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Wow.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Wow.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** And then after we kill her, all of her stuff disappears.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:31]** It just vanishes.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** That's crazy.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:35]** Those race traits are like ridiculous.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** Yeah.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** All right, Kev.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Should we play?


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** No, I'm not ready to play yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** I got to cool down.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** You guys got me all riled up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Yeah, take it easy.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Just channel it into the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Does anybody else have any other topics you guys want to talk about?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** I think Will said something about giraffes or whatever.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Yeah.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** I don't know if Kevin's going to rant about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** We're really going to talk about this?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** Okay.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:05]** I've been looking frantically for the email that I received when I funded or helped fund- Your giraffe wardrobe?

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:18]** No, it was an anti-surveillance clothing, and they were testing it, and they were- Basically, it's like a giraffe print that sort of blends into your neck, and it makes you-

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:36]** supposedly i've heard of this image classifiers will then like say oh this this is a giraffe let's ignore it because it's an animal right specifically a giraffe i love it well because i guess like a baby giraffe and a human or maybe like the same height i don't know

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** But I think it's a scam because I can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** I don't really know.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** What if you get put into those little, like, capture things?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** Like, you know, because, like, AI assembles them.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** It's like, click the giraffe, and it's just you.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** It's yet another scam I fell for.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** It's like it gathered images of, like, giraffe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** So, right.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** It wasn't until this moment you knew it was a scam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Not at any moment prior.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** Clamouflage and anti-surveillance clothing is a real thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** There was an article I read recently about some crazy AI.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** They were testing with the Marines.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:15]** And then so they've had the Marines like walk and crawl and do all this stuff.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** And the AI was learning all that.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:21]** And then they're like, OK, Marines, try to get you.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:24]** All you got to do is touch the thing in the middle.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** I guess it's like in the middle of an intersection.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** So like wide open, you just have to touch the robot in the middle.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** That's your goal.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** And all the Marines passed.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** One set, they're like in pairs.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** Two of them somersaulted the entire way and did not get caught.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:46]** Two of them got into boxes and did like a solid snake style walk and stop, walk and stop.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:50]** And then I forget what the other two did that were just like, oh, one of them dressed up as a tree.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Yeah.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Which is like the most marine thing to do.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** And all of them passed and got to the AI.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** They're like, yeah, we gotta rethink how AIs look at things.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Anyways, that's my story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** That's kind of awesome, actually.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Wait, so we can defeat AI by pretending to be like a giraffe then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** Yeah, so can we defeat this creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:11]** This creature is not AI, so let's play.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Here we go!

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Here we go!

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Here we go!

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** Alright, so last time,

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:25]** Last time, the drift dust formed itself into a facsimile of the gray before attacking Rolim.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** But you all kept your attention on the gray.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Chalk...

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:35]** ran for the computer and tried to shut down the drift drive, only to learn that it was broken.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** That it just wasn't happening.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** But he also found some other interesting things.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:45]** Then Tremei got a massive hit on the Grey, but she didn't even seem phased by it.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** Rolu and Chalk then ignored the dark lighting that I said happened.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** And Thaddeus crawled around on the floor and took some shots.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Now it's the Grey's turn.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** So, before I take you back to the maps, a couple things of housekeeping.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** It's dark in this room for this round.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Remember?

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** I rolled the dice.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** It's dark.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** So Choc and Rollu, you are effectively blinded.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** I don't know how you missed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** I need you to put that shit on your hero.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** I don't know how you missed telling us that.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** I told you this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** I don't know how you missed telling us that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** I'm reinforcing it.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** So I'm going to make next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** But I heard that last time.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** Is it magical darkness or is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** it's regular darkness.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** That's why Treme and Thaddeus don't have a bra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** I've got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** I'm a hero lab.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** It's on there, buddy.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Well, like, cause I'm, Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:35]** I mean, I'm going to add it to hero lab, so I don't miss it again, but he's working on a computer with two rather large screens.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** Yeah.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** But he's got to pull his glasses out cause he's blind.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Okay.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** So one thing about it is you are flat footed.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:45]** You take a minus four penalty to your strength and deck space skill checks.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** And then you automatically fail perception checks based on sight and

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:57]** And you have to do a DC 10 acrobatics check to move faster than half your speed or you fall prone.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** So that's those things.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Yes.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:05]** So I will reroll at the top of the round every round to see what the darkness is in the room.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:11]** Another thing is, I looked it up, slam is a natural weapon, and it does threaten squares.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** So, any questions on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:20]** You make me feel like a natural weapon.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** There it is.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** It does?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** It does.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** It does.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** But you were right, the gray does not have a natural weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** Does the drift dead?

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** What is it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Drift dust, I think.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** I don't know.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** Drift phantom?

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** The drift creature?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** I don't think we know what it is.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** We identified it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** You're right.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** I did.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** It's a drift phantom.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Drift phantom.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** And actually, here, I forgot.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I always forget to show you guys.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:50]** Check this thing out.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:54]** This is what it looks like when it's in its normal form and not one of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** I love the artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** I love all the artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Wow.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** It's pretty sweet.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:07]** It is a cool, gaseous cloud of fire and ice and lightning and things.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** It looks like a humanoid thunderstorm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** It looks like some of the enemies from, what's that game?

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** The God of War game.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Some of them kind of look like this.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** It's like an ethereal purple bean.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** It's so dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** I have no idea what you're referring to, Kelly, but I know what this thing looks like, and it looks scary.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** It looks like a logo.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Right now, I believe it looks like

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** Is it Rolu was the last one I turned into?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** I forget.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** No, it was me.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** I know.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** I'm really excited about it.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** It's Catfish.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** Cool.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** So let me move you guys over to the map.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Let's get back in it.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** Let's get back in it.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** Here we go.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** All right.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** And it is, in fact, the Grey's turn.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** She's going to take a guarded step down.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** And Malziok paces forward stoically.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Okay.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** She took a guarded step.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Yes, guarded step.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Okay, guarded step down.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** So she paces forward stoically.

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:02]** The most perceptive of you are actually going to see that she winces ever so slightly with each step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** But when she stops... It's completely dark.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** We don't notice anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Right, right.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** There it is.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** Except Thaddeus Germain can see.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Anyways, she's going to stop.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:21]** And when she does, she clenches her fists together and these small motes of black energy start to rush towards her from all directions.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** Rolu and Chak, I need you both to roll a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:30]** Why don't you just do a fortitude save for yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I don't need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Seven.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Eight.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Cute.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:39]** Both of you are pulled ten feet towards the gray.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** What is going on here?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** I'm only five feet away.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Can I land on the gray's shoulder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Uh, no.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Why not?

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** I guess you could end up in the same square.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** You could end up, like, right at her foot.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** I'm not going to say on her shoulder, though.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** That's not right.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Could he, like, climb her or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Rolu, we're going to put you here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Okay.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:05]** So now we've been pulled to the other side of this drift phantom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** You're right.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** You're kind of, like, in the middle.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** We'll put you there.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Is that better?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** So she does this.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** She draws you in.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** And then she turns to Rolu and she's face to face with him.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:22]** And she just says, I hope it's worth your life.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** And that's the end of her turn.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** It's probably not.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Termite, you're up.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:34]** Well, then let me just do some quick little calculations here.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** I can picture in Terme's mind all the numbers moving.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Spreadsheets opening.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** I think that's not going to work.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** What are you trying to do?

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:57]** I was trying to see if I could avoid hitting Rolu and Chak if I attack the gray and the specter phantom thingamabob with an overheat spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** I'm going to say no because now Chak is in the same square.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** That's what I'm thinking too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Yeah.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:08]** So I'm going to hit the gray with an adamantine shot.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** I'm going to say, here, catch this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** I thought you were looking for rocks here.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** Try this one for good measure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** That was good.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** That was good.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Yeah, I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Joke's on you.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** She's looking for adamantium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** Oh, perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:56]** yes that's three shots and you roll three times yep three three times to hit uh first one's a i don't think i have a bonus or wait i have to have it's the base it's a d is a d8 is that what you said no no i'm rolling to hit oh on the first one uh you should have it was your uh spellcasting modifier plus decks oh in that case i thought it was maybe i'm wrong let me double check how many more uh spells do you have just this is the last one

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:19]** last one this is this is a god make it count make her count i just wanted to double check that i as a normal ranged attack you'll use your dexterity and base attack bonus to hit the enemies kac so is that is that what i would basically the modifier that it would be on just like any ranged weapon yeah basically yeah yeah okay so that would be 15 does that hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Yes, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Dope.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Five points of damage on the first one.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Nice.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Very good, very good.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** All right.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Ooh, natural one.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** Yikes.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** I don't know if that is all right to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** That's a two hits, right?

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** So I'm going to say pull out the cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Oh, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** Critical fumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** Should I roll the other attack?

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:52]** Because, I mean, the way that the spell works, you throw a weapon, and then I'll roll the other one just to get it out of the way.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Welp.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** That's deuce once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** What?

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Two natural ones?

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Oh my god.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Glorious.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** This is exciting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:07]** Kev is fully erect right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Yeah, dude, his microphone lifted up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** Wild.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** So I do the deck twice, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** Kev, are you winking at us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** That's glorious.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** That's almost like rolling two crits in a row, except for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:46]** i mean it is just the wrong guy just the wrong guy all righty i was rolling so well and then uh yeah it was a good start yeah all right first one stop okay wait are you doing the top one or the bottom one i want the top one from what that where you cut yes yeah so when i cut i i take the top off and then i take the top card you need two of them you might as well just take them both


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** No, I'm going to cut again.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I get to cut it again.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Don't do this.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** In the spirit of randomness, Kev, come on.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** Spell magic is mysterious.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** That's the name of this critical fumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** Do I forget how to do magic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** I love this.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** I was just looking this up.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Love this.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** Roll a D percentile dice.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Go ahead and do this.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** And Kev, I'm going to have you bring this up.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** For the effect of a wonder grenade, Starfinder Armory 127.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:22]** So Google or yeah, just get out your Starfinder Armory.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** 87.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:29]** 87 in a 20 foot radius centered on you.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:35]** 87, pull out armory, page 127, the wonder grenade table.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** This is amazing.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** I love this item.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I just found out about it the other day.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** It is exactly what you think it is.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** I forget.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** It does.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** I forget magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** No, it's just a wonder grenade.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:56]** When it detonates, a wonder grenade releases a locus of magical uncertainty, which explodes into a strange effect once it makes contact with reality.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** When the grenade detonates, roll a D%.

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** What did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** 87.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** 87.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** That falls into the 86 to 90 category.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:12]** For four D4 rounds, the blast radius fills with a windstorm.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Core rulebook page 400.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:18]** We're in a windstorm now.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** We're in a windstorm.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** I've got my CRB.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** How big is it?

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Core rulebook page what, Kev?

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** 400.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** 400.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** 400.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:42]** for hundo windstorm powerful enough to bring down branches if not whole trees non-energy ranged weapon attack rolls take a minus four penalty while attacks with archaic ranged weapons are impossible i don't have this good thing

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:48]** Perception checks that rely on sound take a minus 8 penalty due to the howling of the wind.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:56]** Small characters, which Chuck is not, but he's tiny and so probably would be, might be knocked down.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** Wow, 20 foot radius around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:05]** I would say also, I mean, I don't know, obviously it's not mechanically on the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:25]** the storm card but what like it should affect flying creatures right i mean to be fair yeah i don't know if he's actually flying or not anymore i because he when he flew at you guys i picture that he landed on the ground but i didn't say that so i will give that to you that he is flying but i don't know exactly what that means how do i draw a 20-foot circle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** You click on Thaddeus and you put an aura around him, 20 feet.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** You mean me?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** You mean I can do that?

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** You click on Termina.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Yep, I'll do it.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** That's fine.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** I got it.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Do a 20-foot aura.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** That way it follows you.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Oh, wait.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Here's a question.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:42]** Does it follow him or does it just stay where he is right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I would say it stays where he's at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Yeah, I would think so, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** I don't know how to get rid of the circle I just drew for no reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:51]** Well, while you're doing that, we're going to do the next fumble card.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** All right.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** All right, do it.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:57]** I'm going to shuffle, and I'll do a cut.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** How are you shuffling, John?

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Just like this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** Every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** You want a full f***ing dealer shuffle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Yeah, I want you to do it three times.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:13]** I want you to mix it up on the felt like a blackjack dealer or a poker dealer.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** And then I want you to take just one random card from that.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Yeah.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** So don't... From anywhere in the... No, no, no.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** Smash it out.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Just smash it out.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** And then... I'm just kidding.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** You don't have to do it.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** It's fine.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** I've already done it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Three, two, one.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Stopped.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Jesus.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Top card.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Ooh.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Ugly mistake.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:43]** You move two steps down the charisma poison track for 1d4 minutes.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:47]** I don't even... What the... That's, like, my whole character.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** Oh, my... I'm all charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** For, like, the next, like, couple rounds.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** How do I add that?

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Combat state?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Conditions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:00]** I think there's a poison in Hero Lab, yeah.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** 417 charisma poison track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** This is not good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:07]** You move two steps down, so you're an impaired.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:16]** The victim takes an additional negative two penalty to the affected checks and DCs.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** For a total of minus four.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Yeah.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** If she has one or more levels in a spellcasting class.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** For four minutes?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** For how many minutes?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** For one D4 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Okay, so I roll a D4.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Okay.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Minutes.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Minutes.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** So that's multiple rounds.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** That's ten rounds a minute.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:35]** Yeah.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** That's two.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** So that's 20 rounds.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** That's effectively the rest of the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** Also, it might be the rest of the game at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** Your key ability score is charisma, correct?

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Yes.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** So my ability to do those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Sorry, go ahead.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:56]** You can't cast your two highest levels of spells from that class.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Okay.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** So does that mean zero level two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** Which means you can't cast at all.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Because that would be level 1 and level 0.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** Thankfully you were out of spell slots, but yeah, you can't cast level 0.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** I had cantrips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** I was going to cast stumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:16]** Because that old gem works once out of... What is the cure for once in a blue moon?

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** All right.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:25]** And you take a minus two penalty to charisma-based checks and skills and the DC of your spells, which you can't cast anyway, and special abilities.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** So, like, Force Bolt decreased by two, but I don't think you have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:35]** Well, I don't think it would have affected Force Bolt because it's not charisma-based because it's race-based.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** Yeah, it just says the DCs of spells and special abilities.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** So if it's a special ability.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Oh, I see.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** Special ability.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** Yeah.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Okay.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** You are impaired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** I don't know what that looks like.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** It's added on Hero Lab.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** That's so cool.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** What is the cure for that?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** I think I have to wait 20 rounds.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Yeah.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Is that what it says?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** It says the wait for a poison track is 20 rounds?

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Yeah, it says to move to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Or the spell remove affliction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** You move two steps down for X amount of minutes.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** These cards don't f*** around, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** They don't.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** And they're great.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** That's why I like them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** At least that purple monstrosity is in the range of the storm thing.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** You know what I'm really looking forward to?

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Dying?

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Maybe.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:30]** Minus four modifier is effectively minus eight points.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:37]** I can't wait to hear Will roleplay Termeiden with eight fewer charisma points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** Yeah, so what narratively happens when you cast a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** So he casts a spell.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:59]** And Tremé's, obviously, there's this, wait a second, and then he just starts garbling like Joe Biden on a windy day, giving a political speech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:04]** Back when I was, where was I again?

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** And there was a guy.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** In the Mesozoic period.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** You know what I'm talking about.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** You know the rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Right.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** I feel like you effectively had a stroke.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** You just start rambling.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Yeah.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Just forgetful.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:25]** It was all cohesion for two minutes.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Okay.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** Remind me about the windstorm on a flying creature when we get there.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:34]** There's a lot there that I will uncover, but let's go to the top of the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** Roll for lighting, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** I'm going to roll for lighting.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** That is a two, which I believe is dim light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Okay.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Dim light it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Dim light.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:48]** 20% concealment for Roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Just Roller.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:56]** You hear Chak yelp, because it was pitch black, so all Chak felt was being sucked towards something.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:04]** And in dim light, Chak realizes, oh, look at these gray legs in front of me.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** And then slowly looks up and sees the gray adjacent to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** I love it so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:17]** Constantly being next to tall as F things is funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:18]** Rolly, what are you doing?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Oh, shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** I'm very sorry.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Truly coming off guard.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** I was typing notes.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** I didn't realize I was first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** No, no.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Start rolling.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Wow.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** Notes are the lifeblood of any game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:31]** Not really.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Kind of.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:36]** So I think you had said, I hope this is worth your life.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** And Rolly just threw the mask.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:44]** Their eyes squint angrily and say, it is.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:50]** And Rolu, I'm standing next to the gray, right?

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** I was just pulled.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** I'm not floating or levitating or anything, right?

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** No.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Cool.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:02]** And there's this windstorm that I can feel breezily pushing all of my robes off to the side.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Breezily?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Yeah.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** It's a word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** It is 51 to 75 mile an hour winds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:12]** I'm standing on the edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Are you knocked off balance, Rollu?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** I'm not in it.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** I know what's up.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, I was about to say.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** It's cool.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** That's an afternoon squall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** Rollu's from Florida, man.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** This is canon now.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** We should go fly a kite.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** Yeah, we should go hang out outside.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:35]** All right, Rollu is going to... I can still cast spells.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** And I think, oh, Chak is in the way.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** All right.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:48]** Rolu is going to, I think the first thing Rolu is going to do is do a full attack with the tactical spear.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** Just straight up right in front of you.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Going to do a full attack.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** And let's see what happens.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** I'm just prepping for this.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** I don't know where it's going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:03]** You better prep because I literally just rolled a 19 against KSC.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** That hits.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** That hits.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** That is going to be six points of damage with the first thrust.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:14]** And I don't think this next thing hits an eight.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Eight does not hit.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Eight does not hit.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:26]** Maybe the back of my spear goes into the 50 to 75 mile per hour winds and gets knocked off target as I try and thrust it forward.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** And that is a full action.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:31]** So I'm going to stay face to face with this gray and

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Because she needs to be put down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:38]** To anyone that wants to do fan art out there, do a fan art at that moment, please.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Looking at you, Aiden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Roll his skull, you little alien.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Just face-to-face with a gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** It's kind of like Kev and that kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** For Grayson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** That's...

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** It's Grayson.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** It's Grayson.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** It's not Jason.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** It's Grayson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Cool.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:09]** Well, now it is the Drift Phantom's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Don't forget about the flying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** I didn't forget about it.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** I actually almost did forget about it.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Thank you.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Flying in dangerous wind conditions.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** The more violent the wind conditions, the more difficult it is to keep flying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** These are pretty violent.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** My face.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** It's like a category three hurricane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Yeah.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Yeah, it's pretty high up there.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Schools canceled.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:33]** It says you must attempt an acrobatics check to stay aloft.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** If you fail this, you cannot move.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:46]** And if you fail it by five or more, you are blown 2d6 times 10 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** So we're going to say the wind is going... Are you going to say clockwise or counterclockwise?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I'll give that to you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** I'm going to say counterclockwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Okay, so it's blowing counterclockwise from Will.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:01]** Will's kind of at the door to this lab, and the Phantom is about 10 feet away from him, up to the left a little bit.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** So we're going to just take a vector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** What hemisphere of the space station are we on?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Of what space station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** Which direction do the toilets flush?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Yeah.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Which direction do the toilets flush?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** It'd be the hemisphere on Akiton, and I have no idea.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** I think you're right at the equator, so that kind of screws things up, right?

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** The water just doesn't spin?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** It just goes straight down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** It's like on an airplane.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Spawned into the ground?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** That's kind of cool, I guess.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Yeah.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Okay.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:37]** Anyways, so I blow 2d6 times 10 in the direction of the prevailing wind, and you take 2d6 of bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Woof!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** Fun thing about this is the DC for Windstorm is 27.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** What?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Come on, dude.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:51]** Tormadin accidentally yeeted this thing against the wall and killed it.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Absolutely.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Absolutely.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** It's amazing.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** Task failed successfully.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** Oh, but I just saw what my acrobatics check is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** And it's probably like 30.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** 30.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** Easy, because he's a baddiest-based character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** I rolled a 5 on the dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** And it was 38.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** Oh, you rolled a 5?

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** What?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** What?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** What did you roll?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** 5 on the dice, and you passed?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Your modifier is 20-something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** My modifier is greater than 22.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** His modifier is at least like 19 or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** It says acrobats?

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:31]** and then it says to fly and has additional.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** So this thing, the wind is whipping by, but for whatever reason, the form is just staying in place.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** It's like the wind doesn't even affect it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** It's like terrifying.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** It's like the wind is only fanning its flames.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Right.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:48]** You see the lightning as it crackles away from him, kind of whips, but everything else is just solid.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** But I did not forget, Will.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** I took it into account.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** All right.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:55]** It is that creature's turn, and it is no problems moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** Hey, you guys remember that time Kev rolled a five, and it was still over 27?

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Yeah, that was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** I'm not saying you're cheating.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:11]** I mean, I would typically think of this being like a high-level Starfinder play when your skills are just outrageous.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** But then I'm like, oh, that's right.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** We're only level three, and we're fighting a creature that can do this.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** So that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:21]** I think I'm just going to crack a back and watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** I'm going to sip my scotch.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:31]** If we all die, then, like, does the B team from, like, the ship from the... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:36]** We spit up at Keshi's and Goblin's and we come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** And led by Timothy.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Led by Timothy.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** Dude, that would be great.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:46]** I mean, I don't want to speak this into the universe because I don't want it to happen, but Timothy, if it has to, that would be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:55]** Listener, cross your fingers, knock on wood, do whatever you got to do to wish us good luck because this is a real, real battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** We're relying on you.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** It's kind of like a Blue's Clues app.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** You're going to help us out.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Just chant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:06]** Somebody come in and say, you can't do a double critical fail on an adamantine shot.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** We'll wreck.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** We can wreck on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Yeah, just write, we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** You did that.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Kev is quiet.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Kev, what's going on?

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:22]** You have a smirk of evil on your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:29]** What Kev has not said is that Rolu is now in between the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** I was just waiting for you guys to finish.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** And the drift phantom.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** As the winds are whipping around and you notice this thing is like...

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** This thing is still steady in the wind.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:47]** It just casually moves through the wind and against it to pin Rolu between the creature and the gray.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:53]** So now Rolu is literally right in the middle between these two.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:57]** The other thing is that it's going to actually kind of reach at Rolu.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** And hold on.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Let me make sure I pull my spells up properly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** I'm not blinded, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:23]** i just not currently no no it's dim light but you are now i need you to roll let me hold on i got a million spell pages open yeah sure i need you to roll a which one is it oh no it's neat i attack you to an eac so let me just roll an attack on you all right sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** I'm just going to savor my last few moments here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** That was a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Love it.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** No.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Three?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Three natural ones?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** All right, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Remember this day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Wow.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** My roller's life flashed before his eyes.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** A day that will live in infamy.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** And you know what?

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:52]** It's due to all of you out there going, Will.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Zip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Will.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Zip.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** You did it.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Good job, everyone.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** You did it.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:57]** Here we go, Kev.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Ready?

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Three, two, three.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Two, one, go.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** It looks so dejected.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Stop.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** That's your card.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** You can read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** No, I can't.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** This is an energy attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Yes, it's an energy attack.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** It was actually like an energy spell, but yeah, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Wow.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** I love this.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** Look at the pretty colors.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:25]** You are flat footed and off target until you succeed at a perception check as a move action.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Not as good because of the move action.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** So you're flat footed and off target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** So remind me again.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** I got to make these notes.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** Somebody tell me what flat footed means.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** It's minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** No.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Yeah.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** Well, flat footed, you don't get a tax of opportunity.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Okay.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** I think it's a minus two.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Page 276.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** Minus two to AC and you cannot take reactions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** And off to minus two AC.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Okay.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:52]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** And off target is a minus two to attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** A minus two to attack.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Okay.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Got it.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** I got it.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** Just to both kinds of attacks, right?

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** To all attack rolls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** All attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** All attacks.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** Let me reduce those by two, like that matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Yeah.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Thanks.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** That's what I was waiting for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Well, you can help.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Like it matters.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** That's this creature's turn.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** It was supposed to be glorious and amazing, and then you did that.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** I think it was both glorious and amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** It was great.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** I'm glad you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** It was great.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** And how long does that last for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** I'm glad you're fine.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Until you succeed on that.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Perception check.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Awesome move action.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** Okay.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** And I don't have a move.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** I already used my move.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Got it.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** So, Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Let me look up that DC.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:59]** um chalk is so like i imagine chalk is like hiding among this thing's feet sort of like a snow speeder and an atat so chalk uh looks up and gets the clever idea to use his new pincered l fan he's just gonna start reaching up and pinching oh wow that's that's awesome actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** I know the L-Fan is like a mechanical device, but I just picture completely organic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** It's organic on Rexalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:12]** No, I think it's supposed to be like a backpack type, like metal claws, I thought.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Okay.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** L-Fan.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:21]** Yeah, I would have to do more research, but as far as I know, those are like naturally occurring part of the Rexalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:26]** I read it as it was like some kind of upgrade that they used or some kind of mechanical device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** Listener, tell us on the Discord, do you think it's mechanical or do you think it's natural?

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Mechanical or natural, he's pinching the shit out of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Snip, snip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** For 15.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** 15 hits.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Awesome.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Love it.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** So that is 1d3 plus 1 piercing.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** And you're doing this on the gray, right?

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Yes, I'm doing this on the gray.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Oh, that's a six.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** So three plus one.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** That's four piercing damage.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** Yeah.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Sorry.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Three plus.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Oh, you rolled.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Sorry.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** You rolled a six.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** It's one D three.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** So I rolled a six on a D six, which is half to three because it's one.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** So there's four points of piercing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Okay.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:15]** Seeing his success and being unsure.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** He's like, oh, my bad.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Please don't hit me.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:25]** And cast not in the face on the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:28]** Gets in his face and cast not in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Yeah.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Not here.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** So make a DC 14.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** I think it's a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** We'll save!

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** We'll save!

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** We'll save!

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** We'll save!

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** For the gray.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** I know this.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** I'm looking it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** The gray.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Oh, we'll save.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** For the gray.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** It's a 14.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** It's a 14.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Dang it!

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** How have I had so many ties on this single ability?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Tie goes to the roller, right?

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Tie goes to the roller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** I think this is a pretty effective round, though.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Oh, wait.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** It's Dim.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** You're not affected by Dim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** I'm not affected by Dim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Roller, did you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** Oh, I did.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** I stabbed.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Let's see if I... Did you do 20% concealment on that?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Nope.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** I forgot.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** Let me do it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** I mean, he missed anyway, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** The first one... The second one missed.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** The first one didn't.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Remember?

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** I stabbed you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** It'd be 20 concealment on each.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** Well, the second one missed, so that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** No.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** You missed?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** I don't even know how much you hit me for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** You got one.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** You didn't track the damage?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:33]** What?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** You didn't track the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:38]** I mean, I'm adding the damage up, but I don't remember which number is the one that you... How much did you say?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** You're adding the damage up and not taking the HP away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Okay.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** I got an eight.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** So that's a miss.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** You missed.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Yeah.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** So both attacks missed.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** And what did you roll?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:51]** You said... I think I rolled... Six points of damage?

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Yeah, six.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Okay.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** I remember correctly.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Great.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** Cool.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Love that.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** She's back up to health then.

**[00:42:59 - 00:42:59]** She's all good.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** Thanks for remembering that, John.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Cool.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Chuck, your turn's up.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:33]** so thaddeus is like you're still prone by the way i know thaddeus like sees the storm just like erupt from termay and then he just kind of like looks at him and like the storm is so loud but like termay can like see like thaddeus just like shouting like cursing him and he's just like watering around kind of like looking yeah sort of like uh john travolta uh in pulp fiction oh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** I do love that it's almost like a wild magic trick.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** A little bit.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:45]** You were trying to do this adamantine shot that you've done several times, but for whatever reason, you messed it up bad this time, and then this windstorm comes out of nowhere.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** But it's like the magic in you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:58]** It makes sense that Termes, as a witch warper, would mistakenly conjure up some alternate reality with a violent windstorm.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:07]** Thaddeus, one thing I have to point out is you cannot shoot your weapon.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:13]** Or you can, it's just with a bad penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** And I thought it was only archaic ranged weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Archaic, you can't shoot at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** Non-energy ranged weapons take a penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** A minus four penalty.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Just remember that.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** A minus four penalty if you're going to shoot your kinetic weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:31]** Yeah, Thaddeus is pissed off, so he's just shouting at Torme, but he can't be heard this whole time.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** And he's just thinking to himself, like, I'm surrounded by idiots.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** This is like the third strike with Torme, from Thaddeus' point of view.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** Remember the two strikes?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:44]** So then, like... I don't remember the two... Listen to the last episode.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:49]** Anyway, so... There's too many things happening with Torme right now.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** So...

**[00:44:51 - 00:45:03]** This is bad because if I'm going to move out of this wind storm, I'm going to have to... If I'm prone, I can only end up right next to the purple monstrosity.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Either way, I'm going to have to pass by it.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** That's the closest way.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** Unless, like, he gets up and then moves.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Hold on, let me take a look here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:15]** Footnote, the monstrosity is flat-footed, so if you pass by it, it's fine.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** There are no reactions.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Okay, cool.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** But being prone as he is, Thaddeus is not going to be able to do anything this round.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** He's going to stand up, get out of the prone position.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:47]** and then so he's that's one move action and then he's gonna move past it the purple thing purple thaddeus uh over uh to the west side of the room and he's gonna try to just get a better shot at the gray next round amazing all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** All right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** Rolu, seriously, hang in there.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:57]** I hate to say it, but you look like you're in a bit of a spot, so don't go down, all right?

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** I don't want to pick up your a** later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** That's it.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** This is it.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Great.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:08]** Gur, Gray, it is now the Gray's turn.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:16]** Man, she has this little plant thing snipping at her ankles, and then she's got Rolu...

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:26]** in the middle there what does she want to do what does she want to do nipping mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:34]** I think she's going to take a guarded step towards the drift drive itself.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** So she's going to kind of move up towards the center of the room one time.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Wow.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** She's going to recharge.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I think she's going to actually step.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Please don't do that.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Yeah.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:47]** Then she's going to actually move and stand directly in the middle of the drift drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** What?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** Please tell me she can't recharge from that.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** What?

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** I'm so annoyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Do we see anything?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** I feel like it protects something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** You don't... This is... That's what you see.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:05]** You see her... She does this, like... As... As... Chak goes to nip at her again, she kind of pulls her foot back.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** She keeps her eyes locked on Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** I have an attack of opportunity.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Also... Yeah.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Because she moved out of a threat square into the drift track.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:40]** a pinch you do yeah i i did not call it yeah and that my friends is why i moved into the same square here we go and just just for the listener i they were in the same square so the first move was out of the center square and then the next move was out of his reach because he does get a reach with his elfin lafayette's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** La Flange's.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** That's a 15 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** That hits.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** For two piercing damage.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Two piercing?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Two piercing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** All right.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** So she oversteps you.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** She kind of steps back.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:05]** And then she looks at Rolu and she turns and just like walks away stoically and walks to the center.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** And as she does, you get one more nip at her.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:12]** And she's now standing in the middle of the drift drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Does she also get an AOL from me?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:14]** Yeah, I think she would.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** No.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Do you think she was out of your reach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Unless you have reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** She was right in front of you.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** She was five feet in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** So she took a guard step first.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** That's her first step.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** There it is.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** It was the second guard.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** The second step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:31]** Doesn't the attack of opportunity also impede the rest of her movement, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** It counts as one move.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** So then the rest of her move was to step into the drift drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Right.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:42]** So hitting on an attack of opportunity stops, I think, a spell.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** But I don't think it doesn't stop movement at all.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** It's just they take the damage and keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** All right, Terme.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** It is now your turn.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Don't forget, you're in the middle of the windstorm.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Literally dead center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:03]** Well, one of the things that's really great, the word experience is still a good word, guys.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:09]** I always say that talent is more important than experience.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** I've always said that.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** I've never done this before.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** I've never been here before.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** You know the story.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:21]** I'm riding around and I don't know where I'm going.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** Now, I know everybody.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:26]** I've met a lot of great people around here.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:32]** You make some mistakes like that idiot who dropped a bomb with this wind.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Who did that?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** You don't have to drop bonds on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** You don't have to kill me.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:42]** If only anyone could hear him, we could actually know that he's leaving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** I know.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** He just tried to help.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** Everybody roll me a perception check with a minus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** Wait, for real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:51]** No, I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:57]** By the way, that was me paraphrasing Donald Trump rambling, so let it never be said that I don't make fun of both sides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** For like 10 seconds, I was like, what?

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Is Will okay?

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** I know.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:08]** He played it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** He played it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Nailed it.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** All right.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:22]** So Treme is going to be rambling, and he's going to walk out of this storm cursing the idiot who dropped the bomb, who made this storm.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:32]** And then he's not all there, so he's not going to...

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:52]** think even to like try and do some sort of magic and he's got his frost bit uh frostbite class zero pistol out in his hand so he's just gonna fire it at the thing like why are you shooting bombs of wind everywhere and uh you take a shot of the gray take a shot of the gray


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:52 - 00:51:01]** All right, so he moved out of the windstorm up to the northeast and has a clear shot now at the gray in the center of the drift drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** This is gold.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** 20, dirty.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:04]** Dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** That definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** D6 plus one.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** That's a five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:23]** So you step out of the windstorm and you lift up casually this pistol you know not much about.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** And it shoots this frost ray.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:31]** And that frost ray strikes her right in the chest.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** And you can see her eyes were staring towards Rolu.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** locked onto him.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:45]** But when she got hit, her whole head twists and looks at you as she falls to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** And?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** And Rollo goes, major look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** That's what you get for making windstorms in my building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:09]** and then the whole thing explodes no okay but we're still in combat because they still have this giant jerk phantom there to me that's your whole turn yeah it is the next round i'm gonna roll for lighting so wait she's dead dead you'd have to do a medicine check oh my gosh

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** That's a one, so we're back in dim still.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** You still have 20% concealment, John.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Okay.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Don't forget.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:33]** I think seeing this gray go down, maybe Chak and Thaddeus, Chak, Thaddeus, the two of you perhaps see roll loose shoulders, depress as if stress is coming off of them.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** And I don't...

**[00:52:35 - 00:53:03]** know that rolu noticed at first the drift phantom but i think by now with the purple light glowing rolu has so rolu turns around sees this drift phantom thinking that he was all right for a second takes a guarded step backwards pedaling backwards and then is going to immediately cast overheat on this drift phantom


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:07]** Just a reminder, you didn't have to do that as a guarded step because AOL is done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Oh, because it still hasn't had reactions.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Is it until the start of its next turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Until I roll the DC, you're supposed to look up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** Yep, as a move action.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:22]** All right, so you need to do a reflex save, DC14.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I need to do a reflex save?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** Yeah, as the Drift Phantom.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** Well, not you, but the Drift Phantom.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** You playing the Drift Phantom, acting.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** That's called acting.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** That's a 10 roll on behalf of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Is it a fail?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** That's a 10.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** That is a fail.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Phenomenal.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Oh, what's it called?

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** That was the dumpster.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** So what does it do to me now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:49]** So I pull all the heat from the bodies and I shoot in the thermal wave.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Yeah, it's 2d8 fire damage.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:58]** And I just rolled the best possible roll you can get, which is a six on 2d8.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** That's great.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** And so this flame goes.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** And when you're done, it's still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Did it look like it took damage?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** You can give me a perception check.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Or mysticism?

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** So many perception checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** I don't know.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** I can't just say, no, it doesn't look like it did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** I feel like you can.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** That's fine.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Okay.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** I'm going to look at my mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** That's a 15.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** I think that's enough.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** It does not look like it took all the damage.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:34]** In fact, it looks like it only took one damage from that.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** And you know that this creature has a DR5.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** Ooh, DR five, meaning it just pure damage resistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Like, and we don't know DR five slash nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:47]** What does that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** So there is nothing that this thing can cut.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** All right.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:55]** Nothing that cuts through this DR. So yes, it is just a race five to all your damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Awesome.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** No matter what.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** K-A-C-E-A-C-E.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** No matter what.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** No matter what.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Come on, dude.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** I've had one of these before.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** It's fun to play, but yeah, it sucks to fight.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** All right.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** That's Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Yep.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** Well, it is now the Drift Phantom's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** The DC is weird.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Can I just tell you?

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** It doesn't say what it is.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** It says you have to reference Alien Archive 129 to 131.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** So what are you setting it at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** You have to look at what the CR of the creature is.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Okay.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** And the ability DC of the attack that you tried to make.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** It says of the appropriate array.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Oh, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** Before we go any further, I forgot.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:47]** So as you blew fire at this thing, the flames wrapped around it, and you saw this weird shimmer.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** What?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:57]** Because, yes, it took one damage, but an arc of lightning flashes back at you.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** What?

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** I lost it.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** I had this all written out, and now it's gone.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Where'd it go?

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Oh.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:11]** Okay, so the crackling energy and a ball of that energy whips off and arcs through the air back at you.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Give me a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** Kev, is that a reaction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Maybe?

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** I don't know.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** Man, you guys ask a million questions.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:23]** I don't like this.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** Because I don't get reactions, is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Because you don't get reactions because you're flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** I have to look up and see if it says as a reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:34]** I'm just asking what you would ask if you were in my position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** No, that's right.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** That's fair.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** It's valid.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** I don't believe it is a reaction.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Okay.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Because it was a spell.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** So the spell is already there.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** If that makes sense.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** It says standard action.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:51]** You can choose to dismiss the spell as a reaction.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Yes, it is a reaction.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** I can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** Got him.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** Got him.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Lawyers.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Wow.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** That's called playing by the rules, Kev.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** The gavel falls down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** What is the oldest profession, Kev?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Sagan?

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** Lawyer joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** Okay.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** So ignore all of that.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Oh.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** Back to John.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** What were you saying?

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** So what is the DC for this thing?

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Okay, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** You did an attack on me, right?

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** It wasn't a spell?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:22]** Okay.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:27]** Then the DC is 10 plus one and a half the CR.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** Okay.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** And what am I rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Your perception check.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Perception.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Three, right?

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** I don't know what the CR is.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Or no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** He didn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** He didn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** That's a 17.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** That matches.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** You rolled a 17?

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** I rolled a 17.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** What's the DC?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** The DC is 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Oh.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Wow.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** That's a lot.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Wait.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** It's a CR 14 creature?

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Holy shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:50 - 00:58:15]** what no you said it was 10 plus 10 plus one and a half sorry 10 plus one half the attack one half the cr i think he said one and a half times the cr no one half oh so definitely definitely passes them so yeah yeah so you no longer see colors you're good to go whoo okay um and then now my my if i couldn't see colors i'd be saddened but club blinds no joke man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:42]** yeah yeah okay true that cut that so it's fine it's good to be i think we've always tried to be accessible and we probably will with video and text and stuff also you certainly need to cut it which means we're gonna leave it in yeah once you say it 99 of the time boys 99 i was just saying like you know and you know i design people don't really think about color blind folk and

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** I know.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** It's so sad.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** It's sad.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** It's like plugins now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** It's really important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** It's really important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Sorry if we fail at that.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** That's all I mean to say.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Hopefully we don't.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** We are actively trying to not fail at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** I mean, we are a podcast, so it's audio only for now.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** But our website, we'll try to make it friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** We should probably do it.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Kev just blinking at us.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:11]** This has been... He's like, thank you guys for wasting time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:17]** All right, so the creature passes, and then he's going to step up, or they are going to step up.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** And as they do, the purple Patra then transforms even further.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:36]** The torso now becomes stout, and the legs have contorted to a digit grade as the knees bend backward, and the foot stretches out into the lower leg segment.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** Each arm splits in two.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:49]** The purple fur has become what appears to be the robes with a large collar and a mask that rises up to a peak, looking just like Terme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Hey, twin.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:56]** Then it slams into Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** With an 11 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Well, that doesn't hit right, Rolo.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Yeah, that's got to miss, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Yeah, that misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** God.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Wow.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Stepped up and whiffed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** And that's its turn.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Chalk, what are you doing?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Chalk, my goodness.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** You know what Chalk's going to do?

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:21]** Chalk's going to take a guarded step away from the drift phantom.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:26]** And he's going to use cover fire.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** He's going to fire his light asphalt blaster and try to provide covering fire for Rolu.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Why, thank you.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** Because I can't damage this thing, really.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** No, I guess I could, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** You could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yeah, strike that.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** I'm not going to cover Rolu.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** I'm going to try to shoot this melon farmer.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Yeah.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]** Does 18 melons against EAC hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** It does.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** So you're doing an actual shot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Yes.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** 18 against MAC.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** He's like, great.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]** Playing right into my hands.

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** So that is the melon level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** Turns out seven bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Ooh, pretty good.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** So two points of bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** Yep.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:13]** Thanks for reminding us every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** Thaddeus, like, checks inside of his, like, weapon to see how many rounds he has.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** It's a mad bull.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:26]** And he just, like, gets ready for, like, a full action and shoots twice.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:30]** At the purple, not any longer Thaddeus, unfortunately.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** It's a 19 to hit.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** That will be the first one.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** And pardon me, I'll roll damage after.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:41]** And then the second will be a 14 to hit.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Does a 14 hit as well?

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** This is KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** A 14 does not hit.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** But the first one does.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** So give us the damage.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Yeah.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** This thing needs to go down.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** It really does.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:54]** Oh.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** Wait, what?

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Oh.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** Yeah, it's 10 damage.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Yo.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Yes.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** So five points of damage.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** God dang it.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** It's something.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** I hate this.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Yeah, keep forgetting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** And it's now the Grey's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** No.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** And that's our game.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:18]** Oh, Kevin, why would you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:18]** Oh, my God, Kevin.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** What the crap?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Get him out of the pink thing.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** I'm out.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** I'm out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:25]** Kevin is rolling laughing right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** I'm just... I'm done with you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Get off.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** You're done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05
