## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:59]** All right, welcome back to another episode of We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** I'm Kevin, your GM, and this is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** I just want to jump right into this one real fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:09]** You didn't even let me start the music before.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Kevin didn't even breathe.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** He didn't even breathe.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** Not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** It was like three, two, one.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:18]** Because I was taking a little influence from- From the robot that just ran off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Sorry, go ahead.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:28]** Just for the listener, we have a set of rules that we read off before we record at least one episode.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:34]** We read off a set of rules to ourselves that we have to make your guys' listening experience a little bit better.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:39]** But recently we discovered that Vinny, of all people, hates robotic voices.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** I hate it.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** It's the worst.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** I hate it.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** But he's a huge fan of Rick19.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** It makes me so sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Oh my god.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Vinny looks so upset when that played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** What are you reading?

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** You're drinking Tapatio?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** Is that what it is?

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** No.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Topo Chico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Topo Chico.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:03]** This is how you know Kevin doesn't eat spicy foods and he thinks Tapatio is a drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** Tapatio is not a drink.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** But that's the only word I knew that started with a T. You don't know any other word that starts with a T.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** You're right.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Topo Chico.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Will also likes Topo Chico a lot.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:17]** Although he likes, I guess, non-alcoholic Topo Chico.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Topo Chico is the shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** Can somebody explain what Topo Chico is?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** It's like a carbonated water originally, right?

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** It's by Coca-Cola.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** And then now they have hard seltzer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** That's great.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Yep.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** So I'm sipping the strawberry guava.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Oh, so you're not drinking a White Claw.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** You're drinking a Topo Chico.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** I'm drinking the White Claw.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** I love the White Claw too.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Does this robot have a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** We have to give her a name, yeah, to be honest.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Is that Bernice?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** No.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Oh, it doesn't fit her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** I think that should be it from now on.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Whenever Bernice talks, you have to type it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** It's not a bad idea.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Will's typing speed is pretty quick.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** I mean, he's been typing and playing, it's pretty quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** That is impressive, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** Yeah, I do type pretty fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I still hate it, but it's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** Type in, I'm sorry you hate my voice, Vinny.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Thanks, Vinny.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** We'll get her a name yet.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Is that Dyson?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** The problem is I... I'm sorry you hate my voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:21]** The problem is I sometimes mess up when I type and then that doesn't work for speech synthesis.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** So, anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** I find it creepy as well, Vinny, but I just didn't voice that as loud as you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** Oh, of course.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** I'm just, yeah, I hate it.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I hate every bit of it.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** It sounds unnatural.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:38]** It's usually reading something that's already on a screen and I can freaking read.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:47]** Yeah, there's no situation right now where I will appreciate a robo voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** What if the robo voice was more organic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Those exist?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Like a Rick 19 voice.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I think we've talked about this before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:59]** When you get a phone call and you're like... I will try not to interrupt too often.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Yeah, we'll see about that robot voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** I've had robo calls where they're like, I'm like, you're a robot.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** And they're like, I'm sorry you think that, but... And I'm like, yeah, but I know you're a robot.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Anyways.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** Cool.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** What all are you guys drinking tonight?

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Anything special besides Tapatito?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** Uh, I'm drinking a highball.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:24]** I got some, uh, some Suntory whiskey with some random spin drift and ice.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** Yeah.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Classy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** I'm in the mood for some water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Drinking water.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** It's great.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:31]** It's a good choice.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** The cast, the cast is growing, man.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Fueled Robot Boys.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** I know, we got a lot of people on the show now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** I want water to drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I crack open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** I want water to splash around in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:44 - 00:05:05]** i cracked open a bottle our friends moved away and they left us all their alcohol and the the alcohol they left the wine bottles were all torn to shreds by cats like the cork was still in it but like the cap the labels the paper cover was all torn apart um so this is i guess a turkish red like literally a red wine from turkey you're guessing

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** It was written in Turkish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** How is it delicious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Is it different from non-Turkish reds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Is it more or less juice?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:17]** No, it tastes like any other red wine.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** How are the legs on it?

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** I am definitely not a connoisseur when it comes to that stuff.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I also have a bottle of Dr. Pepper that's almost gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** He's chasing his wine.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Wait, Kevin, how many?

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Exactly what he's doing.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** How many Dr. Peppers do you drink in a day?

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Again?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Two, maybe?

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:37]** I actually, in order to limit myself, I put a single bottle of Dr. Pepper in my fridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** At the end of every night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** It's usually whenever I drink one, I put a new one in.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** That way, the new one's not cold enough for me to drink at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** But it's one a day, right?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** On average?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** No, no.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** It's usually once a week.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** During this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** No.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]** A two liter bottle for yourself then?

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Not just a bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** No, just what size is this?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** It's a liter.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** 16, 17 ounce?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** 16.5?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** 500 milliliters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Half a liter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** I really cut back.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** I used to literally drink like six packs of Dr. Pepper a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** I saw it destroy a man.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** There was a guy in my family once who told me that he drank a f***ing box of it a day.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** He must have been joking, but he really did drink a lot of Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** I believe that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** He looked really weird.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** His veins were all bulging out like he was the Hulk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** He was shaped like a Dr. Pepper bottle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** He wasn't shaped like the Hulk.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** It was not good.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Then he died.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Then he dies.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Right after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:07:03]** Meanwhile, there's a woman who's like, there's a woman that's like 96 years old that got a, this is a few years ago, got like a case of Dr. Pepper because she said, the reason I'm still alive today is because I drink a can of Dr. Pepper every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** I was just looking that up.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** She was 104 seven years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** 104 seven years ago.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** She's still alive and her blood is Dr. Pepper.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:16]** I love me a Dr. Pepper, but I'm glad you've cut back, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Please don't die.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:23]** Then you wouldn't like me to replace you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Yeah, replacing you would suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** But it sounds like we could just get a Dr. Pepper bottle and it'd be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:35]** I think... We'll just download the AP and have the computer read it.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** Then Vinny would leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:40]** It would just be us three with the... You might be onto something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** What if that's like a self-playing RPG?

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:46]** That's... Passive income, everyone.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** I forget the name.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** I think it's Hatchling on Twitter.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** I'd have to look it up.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:56]** But they actually put out a solo roleplay game.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** That's cool.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** It's still on the Kickstarter stage.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Last I checked.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** But I was interested in buying it.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** I probably will now because I said it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:12]** Call of Cthulhu has a solo adventure to play if you get the first rulebook.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** And it's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** It's actually pretty cool.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** It's like a... Choose your own adventure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:48]** yeah but with dice nice with dice and as you go through it walks you through if you roll here then add this to your skill yeah it's neat it's pretty dope you should all play it I like but I'm one of those things like I don't know if I can play games by myself I'm just not it's like watching I don't want to go to the movies by myself I just I don't want to I don't want to talk to a computer hang on hang on I'm with Vinny I'm I'm I agree with Will I also think every time you play that voice I'm going to take a real big swig of my Topo Chico um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:57]** If we just want to get Vinny really loose, I got to replace my voice with the computer voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** I have no problem.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:06]** So, no, Kev, I think it is a unique pleasure to go to the movies by yourself.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** There's no one else to ask questions.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** There's no one to interrupt.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** You don't have to share your snacks with anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** I'm that person.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** I'm the one that wants to make jokes in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** That's why you go to movies alone.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Kev's the interrupter when he goes to the movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** I have been interrupted by Kev many times at the movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** So what you're saying is Kev is the reason I like to go to the movies alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** So basically, it's not by choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Literally, just no one goes with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:56]** i mean it's the same thing like i won't i don't like going to the store by myself i just have like a love going to the store that's kind of weird that's the problem oh my gosh get that's really weird kev you need to get comfortable with yourself also if you don't want to that's fine i hate me i hate me that's just look in the mirror yeah like no that guy try to punch yourself yeah um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** I can't remember what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** That got dark pretty quick.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** It got super dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** No, I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** I'm good.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Oh, wait.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** I don't hate me.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Oh, Kevin.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** I like me.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Real quick.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** You haven't seen Lord of the Rings yet, I think, or whatever, right?

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** We all got to watch that together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** I have still not seen Lord of the Rings.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** I don't ever intend to watch Lord of the Rings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** We all have to watch it.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** And you're actually allowed to ask questions, I think, because we've all seen it before, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:48]** like why are we watching this no not those why are we watching this because it's amazing I was telling John we were talking to John about this earlier like Lord of the Rings I think Lord of the Rings and Star Trek are the two like nerd things like one's fantasy and one's sci-fi that I just don't get involved in and I think part of it is that there's just both of those like universes are so huge and I've never had a piece of it so like I think it's just a little too late for me to get into the game can I just say something


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** Maybe you just want to get into those franchises with your friends.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** You don't want to go alone.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** And you know what?

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** You can watch it with us.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** We'll be there with you.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Yeah.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** We'll hold your hand.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** It's a franchise.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** We're all together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** You have a friend in me, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:08]** I'm trying to think what character Kevin would be most like in Lord of the Rings.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** I think it would be Theoden, maybe.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Oh, I was going to say Mary or Pippin.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Oh, no, that's true.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Yeah, I can see that.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** A hobbit?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Is Pippin a hobbit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** Theoden.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Okay, this is it.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** This is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** When he's GM, Kev, he's Theoden with one tongue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** And when he's player, Kev.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** He's Marion Pippen.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** That's awesome.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** I love that.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** I have no idea what any of that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:38]** And for that reason, I'm going to take us back to the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Amazing.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** Let's get back to something familiar.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Let's play.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** Lord of the Rings is too nerdy for Kevin.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** We need to go to the tabletop now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:01]** Alright, so for reals though, Starfinder, it's way more important to me than anything else.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:13]** Last time, you continued your unprovoked assault on the poor little Lekestis, and then when one of them actually started to flee the fight, Rolu shot it in the back with a critical hit.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:20]** The remaining Akeshi was cornered by Thaddeus, Jermay closing in on the left, and Chak blocking his exit to the north.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:25]** Except that Chak put down his weapons in an attempt to get some diplomacy.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** And the Akeshi took that as an opportunity to make a run for it.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:35]** But Thaddeus shot it in the back of the head on the way out.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:40]** And it fell lifeless and slid across the ground to Vahri's feet.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:46]** Uh, Bavari 13 was a little too focused on their, uh, data pad and tracking the stellar flare.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:51]** And they said, this is it, but this is not the stellar flare.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** Yes.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** John, you have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:59]** I just don't like the tone where you keep making us out to be the bad guys of the Acustia's narrative.

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Yeah.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** We didn't start to raise your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** If you've ever shot someone in the back.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:26]** dude they no no no this is after oh no no kelly you gotta raise your hand too what do you mean like in game like in real life i hope you don't need this room shot somebody before let's keep that uh play the fifth on that one if that's the case no in game i i'll be honest like as the gmo is like i shouldn't care either like i should be

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:53]** objective in the situation i think you're right you made a comment after after we got off that like well we're pirates and we thought they were gonna go tell someone else and you didn't stay at that time you just shot him in the back and wait i thought that they opened up the combat am i wrong did i miss yeah they did they were like we're gonna attack you for no reason some after we tortured this we were like helpless animal that doesn't know any better i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure it was more that like termay was like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** Hey, you guys need to stop what you're doing and pay attention to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** To stop torturing an animal.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** Yeah, that's super threatening, Kevin.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Yeah.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** Stop being alt-domery over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** It's cool.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:09]** You guys will have more opportunities to reveal your true selves and how violent but cowardly you really are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:12]** I think I need a computer voice to reveal mine.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** You throw us a bunch of hobos, we're going to murder them.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:18]** Is that what you're saying, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** Are you admitting to being a murder hobo?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Murder?

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** I don't know.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Where does the hobo fall on the murder hobo comment?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** Is that a hobo that murders people or is it somebody who murders hobos?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:31]** I feel like the second thing is definitely not something we would do because we're good people.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** But we might be murder hobos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** I mean, we technically are.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:42]** If somebody's helpless and needs help, then we'll help.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:49]** But if you're going to throw us a bunch of dudes who don't want help and who just want to...

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, who attacked us and who threw magic missiles at us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Who were cornered by you?

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Kevin's gaslighting is so obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** I'm just saying.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Let's look at the map again.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** You're such a gaslighter, Kev.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Let's look at the map again.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** So just describe the map real quick.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** It's kind of a big dead end, and there's a very large structure looming over it.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:09]** There's a couple of arms that come down and kind of meet in the middle.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:16]** And the two Akestis were in the corner of this map when you guys entered.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:42]** but let's forget about the casties let's focus on like what's actually happening here uh vari 13 had stepped up to uh the the junk pile that we argued about cover earlier um and they are standing over what looks like in a ripped open water heater okay and it's not and she found and she said it's like it's not the thing we're looking for basically

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:51]** Right, so they said that the transponder signal led to this point.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:57]** It's definitely where the transponder was located, but it's definitely not the Stellar Flare.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** That is very clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:09]** Well, Thaddeus being right next to them, they will say, It looks like you failed us already.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** Your little toy there didn't bring us to the right place.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** What's up with that, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** I think you can cool it.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** I think they just look at you kind of stunned.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** They don't even know what to say.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:28]** They are at a complete loss at this point, and they don't know what to think.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** And then you just stab them in the heart.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Well, we're here.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** Let's see what's inside.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** And as you say that, Chalk starts to move forward.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:46]** Chalk actually realizes that this is yet another escape pod from the Starflare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** And then that's when Vari hears you say that.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Like, oh, this is an escape pod.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:57]** And Vari says, those transponder codes led us to this escape pod?

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** I assume they would lead us to the Starflare.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** What was it that Vahri 8 wanted me to discover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** I don't know, but I bet it's inside.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Can we go in?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Is there a way in?

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:10]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** I mean, it's a canister that's just kind of ripped open.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:21]** I think it might be best, Thaddeus, if you just take a minute.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** We'll explore this.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** And he brushes past you to step in front of the escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** No, no, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** That's not going to happen.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** Roll new.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Go ahead and give me a perception check.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** 14.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Just rolling.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** 14.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** All right.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** So you find a case.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** And Vary gasps as you pull it out.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:55]** The case is ripped in half and there's this dense foam inside of it that has a cutout of a short cylindrical shape.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** That is the container from my visions.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** That must be the key.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** We need to find it.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Do you have any idea what it was?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** I wish I could tell you more, but I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:16]** So it appears somebody has already retrieved whatever was in this cutout.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** You don't have any more information, Vari?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:28]** Your transponder took us here and... Can we see, like, perhaps...

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** Like, is there any indication of how old, how long ago this was opened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** How long ago the case was opened?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Yeah.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** No, I don't.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** I mean, like, honestly, I don't know how you would determine that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Like if there's dust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:44]** Sure.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** You're in the middle of a desert.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** How much, how the layer of dust on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:53]** Well, how much like has accumulated inside the casing versus the outside layer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** Yeah, I don't know if I can give that to you.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:01]** If you roll a natural 20 on a physical science check, I will tell you an estimated time frame.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:08]** Before I forget anything else, did you guys want to search the bodies of the Akestis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Yeah, that was my next step.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** I wanted to cast Grave Words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** On who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** On the Akestis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Okay.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Which of the two Acestis are you casting?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Well, the one Acestis is like 100 yards out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** The one nearest to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** Okay.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:32]** So you're going to walk over to it, reach down, touch its corpse, and is that a spell or is that a cantrip?

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** It's a cantrip.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** And what exactly does it say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:43]** You can force a touched corpse to talk to you, but you can't ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** It's a one in.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** Corpse utters random sentences for one round.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** So six seconds.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** With a 10% chance, this information is of some use to you.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:06]** Useful information might include warnings about dangers, an erect starship, the password to unlock a computer, or the name of a supernatural creature seeking you or your allies.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** GM makes a...

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:16]** D percentage roll in secret and decides what information useful or not the corpse spews out in its babbling.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:25]** Once the corpse has been subjected to grave words by any caster, any new attempt to cast grave words on that corpse fails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** The unproved must survive.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** The only thing we fear is that murder bomb.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** These people.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** So Rick is in the lore already.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Nice.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** That must be a Rick reference.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Sorry, Tremaine.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** Can I cast grave words on the other one?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Can I walk over the other one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:19]** that's gantrip i mean if you really want to waste my time i'm not trying to waste time kev i'm trying to be immersed in the story but okay i won't do it to me did you just what's on what's on the what's on the okay so you want to know what you guys search the bodies of the uh yes uh so each is wearing a freebooter armor type one or mark one um and they each have a survival knife

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:29]** And you also find a skull, an emblem of a skull, a steel skull with spiked chains hanging from the eye sockets.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** And it looks something like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** It's pretty metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Yeah, it's pretty cool.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** That's pretty freaking awesome.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:46]** It's like a skull that's kind of red a little bit, almost like there's kind of blood stain or rust stain or something.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** It's like bloodied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:46 - 00:22:11]** bloody pitted and this is an emblem it's it's a steel steel skull okay emblem whatever you want to call it that they were wearing on their bodies um in the picture that i i showed you before that i had to dig up um one of them was wearing it on their arm i can show you that again can i do a culture check on this to see what's going on do a culture check on that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** All righty.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Let's see.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Say 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** 19.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:24]** So you know that this is actually the religious symbol of Zon Kuthon.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:32]** Also known as the Midnight Lord, he is the lawful evil god of darkness, envy, loss, and pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** I mean, it's cool.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:40]** I feel like he's too cool for them, but he's cool.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** I agree.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** He's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** He's cool.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** The god is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** It makes sense.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** It makes sense why they were torturing that K'vok.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** We were the good guys, as we originally thought, obviously.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:52 - 00:23:08]** pretty lame creatures to be worshiping such an awesome god cheers everyone somebody else give me a perception check sorry perception yeah okay i'll i'll do some yeah it makes sense 17 uh

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** It's 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** 24 makes it 17 to not.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:30]** You actually, with your cat eyes, sharp vision, you notice in an intact brown force field, armor of green buried at the bottom of these coils over by the dead kafaa.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Ooh, cool.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I'll sync it up.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** Um, could we get a lowdown of what that is?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Yeah.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** So Brown force field is a, it's a force field type.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** Um, let me show you, read the details on it.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:52]** Basically it has a certain amount of hit points and every round, I believe it makes up a certain amount of hit points.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** In this case, it has one hit point.

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:09]** with a capacity of 10 and it has fast healing so every round you get one point so you get one temporary hit point and every round you get one more hit point for total rounds 10 rounds I think I would take this if somebody else didn't want it

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:20]** And the higher level force fields will have like 10 temporary hit points that heal at 5 temporary hit points per round.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** That's really great.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** But brown I think is one of the lower level ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** It's like the lowest one apparently.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:28]** But so like every round you get back a hit point to your character every round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:57]** sure yeah that's i think that's kind of you get one temp hp fast healing one but not like you don't get one additional per right well you get one temporary hit point from the force and then every i think it's every round you'd have to double check that on double check me on that but i think it's every round it regains one well fat and so basically every round you get a free one hit point but i think it's a maximum of 10 for you know a combat or whatever but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Okay, so you're not just stacking points over time.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** It's just that one gets regen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** Yeah, just one point gets regen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Okay, so you're not going up, up, up, up, up, and so on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** Yeah, if you had a better force field, it would regenerate more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** What I'm curious about is that capacity thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** That's what I'm curious about, too.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** I didn't read too deep into that part.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** That's why I was saying this is something we...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:25]** Thaddeus, well, no one knows about it yet, but Thaddeus really likes Terme helping him out with some information and stuff.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** And he wants him on his side, so he's going to be like, Terme.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** He just kind of sneaks it over to him.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Yes.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** He's very sneaky.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** He's a cat.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** You don't know what's happening.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Where'd you come from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** Would Jack and I get perception checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Do I need to roll a stealth roll for this?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Or acrobatics, maybe?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Let's say... No, hold on.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** How about...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** It's going to be a sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** I don't even think I'm trained in that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Then you can't do it.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** I'm giving it to Tremé.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Well, you can't sneak it.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:02]** But if you want to stealthily tell Tremé, like, here you go, I'll let you do a stealth roll.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** But it's going to be opposed by perception checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** We could communicate telepathically.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** But who has to initiate that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** You two.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** I don't think I'm allowed to do that.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Who's doing what now?

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** Oh, wait.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** I can't even remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** That is, what are you looking at over there?

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** I got something that you might like.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:23]** You've been such a good companion and helping me out.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** I figured I'd give this to you.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Check it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** It's a brown force field.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Yeah, it's a brown force field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Here's the description.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** I'll check it out.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** Unless I have to roll off.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** You can do with that what you want.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** I would be willing to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Weps just gives it to him.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** I mean, whatever happens next happens next with everyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** Do you guys want to roll perception checks on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Yep.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** I definitely want to see if he notices.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Everyone really wants this armor, and I get it.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Roller wants it.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Just make sure Roller doesn't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** That's all.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** It's 15.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** That's a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:10]** How are you adding bonuses on a roll-off?

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** It's a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Oh, it's a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:18]** Because, yeah, Thaddeus is trying to give it to you without telling anybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Okay, okay.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** I thought I was rolling off for this already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** So we got a 23, you said, and John, you said 15?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:29]** Okay, so Kelly, I'm going to make Kelly roll a stuff.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Oh, f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** All right.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Roll high, my dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Oh, no.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:38]** My armor's on, so then it makes me really unstealthy.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Wait, I didn't roll yet.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** See exactly what happened.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** I'm just saying it's a 15.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** So maybe I beat Rolly's check, but not Jack's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:50]** Technically, John gets it because he's rolling against your stuff.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** I know.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** So they both notice you.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** But Chuck clearly sees that you're trying to hide it.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Rolo just glances and sees it.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** But Chuck knows exactly what you're trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:07]** Oh, is that the brown force field armor upgrade that it was only from the equipment officers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** After all, I was thinking it would be good if Tomei had it, you know.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** He needs to be... He's been engaging in combat a lot more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Sure.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:23]** I would also think that Jack would find a compelling reason to use it.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:27]** Jack is somewhat defenseless in some ways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** It's a large item, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** What do you mean by that?

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Jack never seems to get hit.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** It's a small armor upgrade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Defenseless?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** Not defenseless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:40]** Jack is like incensed by the idea that you'd call them defenses.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** What does bulk L mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Perhaps I misspoke.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** I think you could... It could benefit you, Jack.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** I'm advocating on your behalf.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** I don't need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** I'm fine.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** It's one-tenth of a bulk.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** That's like nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** It's very small.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Okay, light.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** Never mind.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** That's super light.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** You can carry 50 of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** Well, I would definitely...

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** roll off for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** If we think about who's been unconscious most often, then it's probably going to be one of the two of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Rolu or Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** Thaddeus, you have it with my blessing.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** That's a fair point.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:25]** Not everybody can be a small plant that just like, you know, is completely...

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:28]** No one even wants to attack Shaq sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:34]** Wait, where is Tremaine's token?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:43]** Yeah, because I need it back on there because I accidentally deleted my token when I was drawing.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:54]** When I was drawing the correct diagram of this area when Kevin was erroneously characterizing how we came in and just attached these guys in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:58]** If you stopped drawing penises on the map, you wouldn't delete your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** I didn't draw a single penis this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:07]** It was like if penises were built out of Legos because it was all square shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:13]** There were squares at the edge of the map where we came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:17]** I think a square hole might be.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Thank God, Benny.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** The arch.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Which hole does that go into?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** That's right.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** It's the square hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** You just got to find a compatible hole.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** I don't know why we're doing this.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** That's right.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** I absolutely love that video so much.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** I know, it's a great video.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** I don't know what that is, but I'll have to check it out.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** It's a video of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** It's somebody with the, you know, the like children's shapes cut out in the top of a tin.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** And the guy's like, where does the square cube go?

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** The square hole.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** And then he picks up the next one.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** It's like, where does the half circle go?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** That's right.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** The square hole.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** He puts everything into the square hole.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** And then there's another video of somebody else watching him do it.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** And he's just like, ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** The reaction video is the best one.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** Which is hilarious because Grayson was just playing with one of those the other night.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** And he got every shape right.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** And even when I was like, that's a hexagon.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** He was like, hexagon?

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:17]** My whole life revolves around that child so far.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** I almost named him Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Well, he might become a doctor later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** I mean, he would be Mr. Pepper until... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** Until he makes a doctor.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:32]** Fun fact, there's no such thing as a Dr. Pepper to sound better for selling purposes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** It does?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:57]** no i'm pretty sure a doctor didn't create that drink yeah i thought i thought it was like formulated by some doctor back in like the uh it actually started uh from a back in the yeah i think i forget what year it was but basically you used to mix them at a soda shop a soda shop yeah and it was the guy who worked at the soda shop 23 flavors all the flavors they had available into one it was just what the doctor ordered that's right that's a real story huh

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:18]** okay you're talking back on the map um you guys have dug through and looted the bodies of the two you just terribly murdered as they tried to run away from you in fear you found i think pretty much everything there is defined is there anywhere else to go here

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** Yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Well, it's a dead end.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:26]** So before we... So you could go to one part of the dead end or the other part of the dead end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:33]** Before we back out of the water heater, are there any signs of who might have taken the cylinder that we're looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:38]** Sounds like now's the time for a survival check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** Ask the right question, get the right answer, Will.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:47 - 00:33:08]** uh nine yeah all right so rolu is is got some tracking history and he looks down he doesn't quite find tracks but you find a pattern in the dirt that can only be described as impressions from a refrigerator we got your own but there aren't stole it what are we talking about

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:14]** Like, there aren't any drag marks from, like, one to the other, but there are several, like, just squares in the ground.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Is your refrigerator running?

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** And you don't see any refrigerators.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** That's pretty good.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** I just got that.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Wait, what'd you get?

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** I missed it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** John, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** If you're going to share the joke, share it with everybody.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Tell the whole class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** I said, is your refrigerator running?

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** Is his refrigerator running?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Oh, is your refrigerator running?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Got it.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** You better catch it.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** That's funny.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:52]** okay so vari vari is standing there just like yeah they admit to you they are like they're lost not physically lost but just like mentally at a complete loss of what to do next um and they are willing to take suggestions


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** It appears we need to follow these tracks.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** Does anybody else see these large squares in the ground?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Are they leading out from this dead end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:06]** I'm going to say you see the squares kind of just sporadically.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** It's not necessarily like a trail.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:12]** But if you want to try to follow them, I will let you.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Is that your only option?

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** I'm going to say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:30]** So wait, we don't have any other beacon from like the item itself or like Fari has no other means of orienting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** I only know the two beacons that we have.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:36]** We know the locations of those two escape pods.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** So do we want to go to the other escape pod?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** That was the one that we... You already went to the first escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** So there's only two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** The car yachts.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Two escape pods?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** Oh, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:57]** Well, so if... Hey, Vari, are there more than two escape pods?

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:05]** From my understanding, there are six escape pods for a given... That's not what I said it was.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Venture?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** I think it was a Venture.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** No, I forget what term it was.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** Whatever ship, insert name of ship.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Oh, here it is.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Kevolari Venture.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Gotcha.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** So we could possibly find four or more on this planet somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** Is it possible to attune to find those?

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** Do we need to be within a certain range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:29]** I do not have the transponder codes for any other escape pods.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** I only had the two.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:35]** Well, I had one transponder code that led us to the initial escape pod.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** And I know that escape pod must have been VARI 8.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** The transponder code I found in that escape pod led us here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Is there another one here that could lead us to a third?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** So VARI will try to plug into the escape pod.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** However, it doesn't work.

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:00]** There's zero power to it, and it looks like the computer chip was completely fried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:04]** Just want to mention while this is going on, Thaddeus is rebuilding his breakaway Aegis.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Thank you for noting that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** I think we're going to take a 10 minute rest while this is going on too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Okay, so you guys take 10 minutes.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:22]** While you guys are doing that, Vari is tinkering away on their data pad trying to figure out what can and cannot be done.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:32]** And what they come back and they tell you is that they might be able to figure it out, possibly, if they had some help.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Gotcha.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** What do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** Computer's help or engineering.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** What sort of aid do you require?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** Okay, so I'm going to give, I need one of each of these.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Only one person rolls.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** I need a piloting check.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** I need a survival check.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** And I need a physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:57]** I could do either piloting or... What was the other one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Physical science and survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I could do piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** I've got piloting plus six.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** I have piloting.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Okay, well, you should do that one.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** I don't have physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Me neither.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:13]** Yeah, I think when I created Chuck, I assumed we would be getting into inter... Me too.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Intership combat.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Maybe we will.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Maybe we will.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** The story is young.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:29]** Thaddeus, do you have any skills in the physical world outside of killing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:37]** I'm good at survival and I'm good at acrobatics, but I don't know much about physical science or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** I hear he makes a really good creme brulee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** Baking is difficult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** I haven't been passing my recipes to the chef for a while.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** I don't think anybody has physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** None of you have physical science at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** No, nobody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Wow.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Okay, well, let's see.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** If you can roll high enough on the right tier, I'll give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** Owen Wilson is next to join the podcast.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Can we even roll it if we're untrained?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** This red car rolls up to you and looks at you and says, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** That's a 26 for piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** 26.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Okay.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** And what's the survival check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** It's a natural 20 on the die.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Dang.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Oh my God.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:21]** I just rolled a 17, but that's for physical science untrained.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** So it's probably like a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Yeah.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** I'll let you do that.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** You can take a minus.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** We'll just say minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** So I did a 13 on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Okay.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** And what is your survival check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Who's got survival?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** I believe Kelly does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** I have it, but it's plus zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** I have plus zero, too, and only one person can roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** That should be me.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Hold on.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** All right, let me do it right now.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Actually, let me double check one thing.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** All right, here we go.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:52]** He just kind of takes out his trusty dice from back when, from Vesk 7.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** Okay, it's just a 12, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** Ouch.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** So Thaddeus fails you all.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** But the other checks I'm going to say were good enough to make up for that.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Okay, so... Classic.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** You spend some time collaborating on a solution.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Classic whips.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Right?

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** There you go.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Sorry, Kev.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** That was a good attack to the head.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** No, you're good.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:20]** So Vahri is trying to describe their idea of how to fix this, and you guys are providing whatever input you have.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:24]** Like, hey, I know this, and I know... And Chalk comes out and is like...

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** I've been watching pilots fly for years.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** I know exactly how this works.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** I know how planes and ships and all sorts of things pilot around.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:42]** And with that, your combined knowledge, you, you all, and Vari work out that the two escape pods can be used to back-calculate the path of the Starflare.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Ooh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** What?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:54]** By studying the escape pod impacts by their current locations and using gravitational acceleration in Akaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** They don't act independently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Never mind.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** You could do it without a window, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** Will, are you questioning the physics in our fantasy game?

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** For the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Just making sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:13]** So VARI is able to build a simulation on their data pad.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:17]** And that reveals that the stellar flare has to be within this given area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:22]** And from there, it might take some searching, but you at least know a path.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** So you can have two options out right now.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:37]** You can either follow those big squares and see where those go, or you can go to this almost gray area and know that the stellar flare is somewhere in there.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** Avari, do you have an idea of how long the Stellar Flare's been there?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** We know that the Stellar Flare actually went down about 300 years ago.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** It's probably not going anywhere in the next 10 minutes.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** I say we track these squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** You took the words right out of my mouth, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Any objections?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Hollywood squares it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** He just finishes putting his breakaway together like that steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:07]** Go ahead and give me another survival check for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Come on, webs.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Let's see.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** 17.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** That's got to pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Okay.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** All right.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** We don't die.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** So you guys head out.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** You start tracking these squares.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** You actually find a pattern.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Yeah, one.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** And then two.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** Probably about ten feet apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** There's three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Say again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** There's also three.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** So there's a pattern.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** One, two, three, four, five.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** And then what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Four squares.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:46]** And then one.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** That's like Kevin just counts the foxes that come out and it's like vampire voice.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Yeah.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Blood sucking all of us.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Twenty foxes.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** That's right.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:18]** n plus one the pattern of okay so you follow in these squares i need somebody roll me a perception check i got you i also got you i think as we're rolling as we're walking oh what was that will i got i rolled an 18 22 for that yours cool mine sucked

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** All right.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:26]** So as you leave the area, you actually hear something in the distance.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** It's like loose rubble falling down a hill of junk.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Crap.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** And then you continue to march through the desert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:42]** Hey, do you guys, as, as we're marching, I think, I think Chuck is like, Hey, do you guys remember the, uh, that Vesk message?

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Something about a junk construct.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** You think this might be it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** I don't remember what the point of it was.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** Was that like a point of interest and for what reason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:59]** That was the Vesk deciding to prove themselves and die in a particular manner.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** That was honorable.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** That rings a bell.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** Zethelred's quest to find tougher enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:29]** tougher creatures to fight and then he didn't come back so it's a tough spot to fight something the concept i love i love this like game of memory telephone uh all right so you guys are actually pulls out his asphalt blaster and says let's uh let's be on our toes yeah i think we're all walking with our weapons


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:57]** all right weapons drawn i love it as we're walking i think rolu hangs back with termay and and just says to termay termay have you have you used that spell many times brave words often enough it's jarring i was not expecting to see this creature that we killed speak again have you ever used it on somebody that you knew personally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:06]** I don't discuss the personal affairs of the dead, but if I were pressed, perhaps I might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Seems like it could be harrowing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:25]** I view the dead, whom I know, to be somewhat, call it what you want, sacred, or perhaps maybe just...

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** It's uncouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** He just puts them on a pyre and lights it on fire and just looks at them burn.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** It's like that honorable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:37]** And then casts grave words on them while they burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** It's like, oh, God.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Why are you burning me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** What is he up to?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** All right, whatever.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** It's up to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Yeah, I'm curious, too.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Why do you ask?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:57]** I was just not expecting, as I said, to hear them speak again after they were dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** Well, you know what they say.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** Dead men sometimes tell tales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:08]** That is a very common saying and idiom, yes, in the packed world.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** So you're absolutely correct.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** So is pirates, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** God, Roller.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** What are you doing?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:19]** He's trying to ingratiate himself towards Treme to get him on his side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:23]** How's that brown force field protector shield working out for you, Treme?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:31]** Uh, I haven't, uh, well, I mean, for mechanical purposes, I have it equipped, but I haven't added it to my hero lab yet.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** So I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** Well, when you do, I'm very glad that you have it.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** We need you around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** What is this hero lab that you speak of?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** All right.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** So we, we established you guys have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** It's what I use to, to keep track of, uh, the equipment on the ship, but also my, my personal character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** That makes sense.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Yeah.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** It's great software, actually.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:56]** So you guys are marching through the junk-laden.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** You have your weapons out.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** We've established that.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Let me know.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** I want to know your environmental protections.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Have you had them on or taken them off?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** What is your plan with that?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** Each of you, individually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:10]** It's like equipped.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:15]** It's actually integrated into that Golem Forge plating that I got, too, apparently.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** So it's kind of dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Well, it's either on or off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** It's on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** So there's a charge for each 24-hour period.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Right.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** I don't think Chuck has noticed any reason to have it on.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:33]** I'm assuming there's like a Geiger counter nearby that we could know if there's nearby radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:38]** I don't think there's any reason that we would have had it on since using it the first time because that was the previous day.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** So now we're on another day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** So I don't have it on.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:45]** So we'll take what each of you took, used probably two, maybe three hours of it.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:49]** I don't believe Thaddeus had any.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** On.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Never turned it on at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** But you're saying you had it on since you put on the armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** I had it on since because I didn't turn it off after picking it up.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:02]** And I didn't know about how the charges worked and that they expired with time.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** So I just, in my brain, it's Kelly Abney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:12]** I figure your armor level is at, but it's basically 20, you get 24 hours per level of your armor, I believe it is.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** So we'll say that you spent about six hours of it and you're saying that now you're turning it off?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** I did not say that.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** It's on.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Okay, yours is on.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:30]** So just for clarity, Chalk and Rolu have turned off, and I did not hear what Treme said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** Is there a reason to have it on?

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** Yes.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:39]** I would be running it constantly, but if...

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:50]** For instance, if there was some sort of solar activity and, you know, atmospheric conditions that would alert me to such, you know, hazards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** I need a yes or a no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** Uh, I'm going to say no, just cause I, so like three of you have it turned off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** One of you have it turned on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Also give me a marching order.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:07]** I just want to know, I'm not going to put you on a map yet, but I need to know what order you're, you're standing in.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** Well, I'm going to say whatever order you go in, Vary is standing close to Ralu and right behind them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:38]** um who was it that rolled the survival check for us to track the squares okay so i'm first i'm guessing yeah that's i expect check is probably following very closely i think like rolu dropped back to talk to termay he's a little too antsy to be close to the back yeah yep when you when he's trying to manipulate okay okay yeah so rolu and then i'll put vari in the very back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** So I have Thaddeus, Chak, Terme, Rolu, and then Vahri.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** All right.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:47]** So as you are walking through the desert and it's the peak of the afternoon heat.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Now wait for me to finish before you start rolling anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** We see ripples of heat distortion across the camera shot.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:03]** Anyone not wearing environmental protections, I need you to roll a fortitude save.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** And on a fail, you're going to take 1d4 of non-lethal fire damage.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:15]** If you're wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort, you have to take a minus 4 penalty.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:39]** heavy clothing or you can also okay second any armor if you're wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort got it is is the way it reads a giant sand trap and i'll say that you could also roll a survival check uh for plus two bonus if you're walking at half speed i believe it is question yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** Does anyone have armor upgrade slots?

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:49]** Because I can't use this brown force field with my freeboot or armor because I don't have an upgrade slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Yeah, let me check my second skin.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** I think I do, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Oh, wait.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Second skin has it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** I gotta find it in my handy dandy handbook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** If you have second skin, then you can keep it.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** If you want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:08]** A second skin can also accept upgrades, making it popular for celebrities, diplomats, and whatever.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** Yep, it has one upgrade slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** Yeah, but doesn't the force field require two upgrade slots?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** Yeah.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** There it is.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** So I have an upgrade slot, but I can't use it because I don't have two.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:40]** same same uh i don't know if i have it let me see it sounds like we need level three armor to go with our level three upgrade i think we do yeah yeah i only have one just keep it on just keep it well i'll hang on to it i just can't equip it do we want to make a gm call to say it only takes one slot

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** Do you think Kevin will give that to us, given his track record?

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** I think if he gave us the item, he gave it to us with the intent of using it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Oh, that's true.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** That's true.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:55]** I mean, man, I didn't write the book, so... You don't have to make the call now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** You can sit on it for a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** I'm curious.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:59]** So the Golem Forge armor does not have two slots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** It has just one slot.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Just one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Okay, yeah, GM call, it's only one slot.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Oh, they're not going to call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** Because I'm soft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** You're softy.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** As was said on some random Discord.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Well, not random.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** You're also easy on the rules, Skip.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** That's what they said.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:40]** all right so um thank you kelly sorry to distract from we're deleting all of that right no actually that's gonna be the whole episode yeah cool so we have to make a fortitude save and we get a minus four for wearing heavy clothing or any armor so we all take a minus four yeah i guess if that's if you're all wearing armor that or clothing or so if you're naked you're fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** If you're wearing light to medium clothing, you'd be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** So we roll the fort save at a minus four.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Is that?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** Yeah.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** Yes.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** So 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** I don't know what the DC is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Because all rolled a 13?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:57]** I rolled a natural 20 on Fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** So a 16.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:01]** 16 and a 20 plus whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** So a natural 20 was an automatic pass.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Not for saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** Not for skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** No, not on skill checks.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** But it's passing.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** The 20 itself is passing.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** But I'm sorry, Chuck, you fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Also, Rolo got a zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And it was a reflex, right?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Wait, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Rewind.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** So, Will, you rolled a natural 20.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Chalk, you rolled what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** A 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:31]** 13, and Rolo rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:36]** I have a plus zero to my fortitude save, so four minus four is zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Okay.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** So I got a zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:43]** So the two of you are going to take... What did... Oh, I guess he's wearing environmental protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Three points of damage.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** It's non-lethal fire damage.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Not that big a deal.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** From what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:49 - 00:53:14]** from the sun it's hot oh okay yeah i feel like that tracks so like you notice that some of like checks folia just starting to wilt it's uh and i think you guys are just not like not prepared to like hike through the desert it's pretty dry out here perhaps we need to turn on some environmental protection status seems to be a little a little bit ahead of us how is this how are you not affected by this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:20]** Thaddeus just turns around just like a breeze basically looks like it's going through his fur as he smiles back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:26]** With his helmet like fully enclosed his fur is still floating around.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Air conditioning on full blast today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** It basically answers the question for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** Rola turns on his environmental protections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** Here's another tricky part is if you took damage, you are now suffering from heat stroke.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** So you are fatigued until you heal the damage that you lost.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Okay.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Cover the damage that you lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Dang.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Okay.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:48]** I feel like heat stroke is pretty intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** It can be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:54]** Your brain is dying from non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:07]** You can neither run nor charge, and this is fatigued, and you take a minus one penalty to your armor class, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls that you add strength to damage, reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and strength and dexterity based skills and ability checks.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** That's outrageous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Wow.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Oh, right.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** So that all apart, you guys still hiking through the desert.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:21]** You're feeling a little woozy, and Vahri recognizes this, and they are going to try to just like talk to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** I'm in the mood for some water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:28]** I think we're also moving pretty slow.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:31]** I mean, Rolo's in comfort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:54]** no yeah so just to like just to waste a little bit of time and try to get your mind off of the situation vari kind of like talks to rolu and says i have gathered a lot of information about your culture i find it fascinating are you from the world ship adari um i'm i'm sorry wipe some sweat what was that

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Are you from the Adari?

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:02]** I know that Kasathans often come from the world ship.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** It's almost like a planet of its own, but it's actually a vessel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:14]** The Adari is quite an amazing feat of technological achievement by one particular race.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** I wouldn't go that far.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** That's an opinion.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** Sorry, you asked another question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Are you from the Adari?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** Can I make a... No.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Rolly is so sus, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** I'm sorry if I intruded on anything.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:37]** I did not mean... I was just curious.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** It's fine.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Let's keep walking.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Alright, so you guys continue on.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Awkward.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Awkward turtle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Thaddeus maybe overheard that.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** I don't know, but he's gonna log that mentally.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** He's washing out on this Rolly guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** Alright, so sometime... I need a drink more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Sometime later.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Yeah, I killed my Topo Chico.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** I gotta pop another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:08]** Sometime later, you start to round a jumble of rusting iron crossbeams.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:13]** And if you listen carefully, you can actually hear what sounds like arguing ahead.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** What?

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:22]** Unfortunately, the way the layout is, the only way forward is towards that heated discussion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:25]** I think Rulu's... Well, Thaddeus is in front.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** Towards the heated what?

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Discussion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Discussion.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:37]** Yeah, it's a word for any kind of conversation between two people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:42]** I thought you were saying... Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:42 - 00:57:02]** i i missed something so there's a heated discussion happening somewhere that we overhear and we're going towards yeah so you're you know you're traveling forward and like just the way that the the landscape is laid out like there's only kind of one path and along that path you hear the almost like the echoes of what sounds like a heated discussion that kind of voice yeah what kind of voice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** You're not close enough to actually distinguish that.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:12]** Thaddeus rolled a 20 for stealth, and he's going to try to find a rock or something to kind of wiggle in behind and kind of peek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** All right.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:19]** So Thaddeus kind of waves his hand back, gives the fist up, like, stop.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:24]** And he launches kind of forward, sneaks up, and hides behind this rock close enough.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** And you see... Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** You actually see...

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:47]** check loves hot female and so he's gonna sneak like screw the fist he's sneaking up with termay and got a 24 for stuff nice amazing stealthily enough that you could actually jump on on his back and like climb up to his head without him noticing it's like where are we going

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:55]** It's a shot on the heated argument and it's a reverse shot back to Thaddeus.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** And you just see Chuck's head pop up over his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** That's so creepy.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:09]** So as you make it up to this rock and you kind of peek over and then like the head, you know, Chalk's head kind of pops up too.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:18]** You both see a space goblin dressed in a pair of dirty coveralls rummaging through a battered chest almost as large as herself.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:27]** While a male Akeshti wearing a shiny silver flight suit sits nearby on an overturned and discarded cooking range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** This is what you hear.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:35]** Would Thaddeus know by looking at that that that might be the missing thing that came out of the box near the whatever that we were just at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Go ahead.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Roll me.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Shoot.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Engineering.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** I am not trained in that.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Neither is Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** So neither one of you know.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Well, the two of you don't see this.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** But I see that there's something that I suspect.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Eh, maybe.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** Right, I mean, we saw the shape of the hole.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:00]** So, you don't know what they're rummaging through?

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** They're just rummaging through a chest at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Just what is in there?

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** The Akeshi asks.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** You've been rummaging for hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:14]** Uh, nothing good in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:17]** The goblin answers, closing the lid and jumping to stand on it.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** Uh, see?

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** This is what I'm talking about.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** We have to focus.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** And the goblin, balancing on one leg, cocks her head to the side.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** What?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** The Akeshi hides his face in his palm.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Mark, the door.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:36]** You said we had to find a way into the starship.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Ah, yes, she says.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** I have a plan.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Then she hops down, opens up the trunk again.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:46]** Maybe I have something in here.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Go ahead and roll me a sense motive check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** 21.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Six.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** All right.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** It's a two on the math rock.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Yeah, it's not great.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** 20 on the math rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:11]** I'm going to say that actually, Tremé, you're far enough back that you can't really figure that out unless you guys move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** So, well, I don't see a map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** So you're right.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:18]** This is all theater of the mind, but to me, you and I are hanging back.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** So we don't hear any of this, right?

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** This is still unintelligible to us.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** And it's only unless you decide to move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Yeah.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Are they within 30 feet?

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Yes.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Okay.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Then I could hear them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** No, no, no.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:32]** They're within 30... I think they as in Chalk and Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:41]** Thaddeus won't know because he's not... He doesn't... He can't figure out what the f*** they're... He's gonna, like, do this, like, hand motion asking them to come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** And I would mind link with Thaddeus at this point.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:44]** Okay.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Because you have the circlet, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** That we picked up earlier.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Yeah.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** And... Cool.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:51]** Y'all are within range.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]** I think Rolo's gonna walk up.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** And he is going to...

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:06]** Uh, yeah, he's going to do a sense motive and he gets a 15 because he has an inkling in the back of his head that he should walk forward.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:15]** And he uses one of his paradigms to, uh, take an automatic 12 on his sense motive skill to get a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Great.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Um, I'm also going to need you to roll a stone.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Yeah, I need that.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Sounds good.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Hope I don't f*** it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** In retrospect, it might not have been good to call them forward.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** I got a three.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:45]** So as you walk up, you recognize that these two characters are friendly to one another, which definitely seems at odds with what Riddle told you about space goblins and Akash Tease here in the Outer Junk Field.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:46]** That's right.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:52]** but you kind of sneak up and then you very loudly go, what's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** I wouldn't do that.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Okay.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** Even I feel bad for Rolly.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Yeah.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** You kind of, you kind of stumble into them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Yeah.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:08]** Like I'm, I'm like so drawn into being like, wait, I should hear this, what they're saying.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** And then I like kick some rocks.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** Rolly, you butter toes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** What?

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:16]** Have you come for the great rock?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** And that's our game.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:20]** What?

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** No, I needed to know.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** What was going to happen?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** How dare you, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Kev, let us keep playing right now.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:32]** Space goblins are really dumb, so we can get some good information.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Dude, that's so rude.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** They're not dumb.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** No, they're dumb.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** That's so rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** That's specious.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:41]** If I just turn off the music, will you keep going?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** I'm down to record another episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** No, I was trying to play for the banter at the end, but you didn't get it.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** No.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** I guess this is our banter after all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Yes, banter more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** Yeah.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** I've been outvoted.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:57]** Go ahead.

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** Continue to banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:15]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
