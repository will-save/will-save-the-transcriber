**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:01 - 00:01:01]** I am Kevin.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** Let's welcome everybody else.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:09]** We have Will, Vinny, John, and Kelly.

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:10]** Go.

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:11]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:14]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:14]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:18]** I feel like I wanted like a Powerpuff Girls thing where it's like, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** John.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]** Kelly.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** Post.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Do it all in post.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** Yeah.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** We'll do that in post.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** Teen Girl Squad.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** That's what we should do.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Teen Girl Squad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** The Ugly One.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** So and so.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** What's your face?

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** Cheerleader.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:37]** Can you believe we're live on video right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** On video?

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** We're not live live.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** We are live.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** What are you talking about, Kev?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** This is for us.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Nobody's going to see this.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Sorry, fans.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Okay, we might give you a taste.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:50]** One day, we're going to look back at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** A little nugget.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Just a screenshot.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** That's all you get.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** What's the difference between a nugget and a nougat?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** Nougat is like, that's like a caramel filling or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** Yeah, nugget is like a chunk of something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Nougat is not caramel, is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** It's some kind of filling.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** No, it's like mousse or wafer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** It's the inside of a Three Musketeers bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Yeah, it's a decent bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** I love nougats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** It's too sweet.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:17]** It just, like, sits on the palate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** Says the man currently living in Jacksonville, Florida.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** Do you, like, analyze chocolate bars and stuff?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** I do.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** I love it.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** You should have, like, a channel for that.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Reviews them on YouTube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** You know, the crazy thing is, like, that is somebody's job.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** There is somebody's job to taste Musketeer bars and make sure that they are, like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Didn't that get old after a while?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Cause like you're just making sure it just came out.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** Yeah.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:47]** Like that poor person's just like, I mean, there's probably a control tester as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Like at the Mars factory.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** Have you not seen the video of the ice cream guy with the spoon where he takes a spoon and puts it in his mouth?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:58]** That's a crisp vanilla.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** Just bringing out a taste of sweet taste.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** It's like the worst video you've ever seen in your life.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** I can't believe I've never seen this.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** The mouthfeel guy.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** The mouthfeel guy.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** It's a mouthfeel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** The nougat thing, it's probably automated by this point.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** There's a machine that analyzes it.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** non-destructive testing.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** They're like, oh yeah, the flavor's right with just lasers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** They're no longer checking flavor, they're checking chemistry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** Because that correlates somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** I have a question.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:32]** Which of the three Musketeers, which of the four Musketeers is missing from the bar?

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** It's like D'Artagnan, right?

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:37]** D'Artagnan's the one that's gone in the three Musketeers.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** Spoiler.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** So if D'Artagnan was added, what flavor would that be?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Caramel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** And that becomes a Milky Way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Oh.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** But it's just protein and Milky Ways, right?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** What?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Well, like, it's called a Three Musketeers.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Or a Mars bar.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** But it's just chocolate and nougat.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** So it's not even three flavors.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** It's not even three flavors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Yeah.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Well, no, because it is three.

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:00]** It's air, chocolate mousse, and, you know, actual chocolate.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** A little bit of air.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Dude, you know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Then the fourth one is the plastic on the outside.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** It's classic big candy.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** Just trying to pull the wool over your eyes, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** It's big candy.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** Britannian is just the eye candy.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** It's the eye candy.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** He is, man.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:17]** There's, like, the man-whore one, and then D'Artagnan, and I can't remember the other two.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Porthos, right?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Yeah, Porthos is the man-whore, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:25]** The most I know about The Three Musketeers is that movie with, like, is it Chevy Chase and Martin Short?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** That's The Three Amigos.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** Yeah, that's The Three Amigos.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** Same thing.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** That's a totally different movie.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** That's all I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** It's close enough.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Okay, but...

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** Equally is kind of odd, though.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** The Three Musketeers movie had Charlie Sheen.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** I can't remember who Porthis was played by.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** And then Leonardo DiCaprio is D'Artagnan, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** No, no, no.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** If you think about it.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:55]** It was the guy who played Robin in Batman and Robin with George Clooney or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Also, are you thinking the man in the Iron Mask?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** Because that was Leonardo DiCaprio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** That also had the Three Musketeers in it, but they were not the main part of the story.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It was kind of weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** He was the fifth Musketeer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:15]** Star Wars is also like a three Musketeers with like a missing fourth Musketeer because there's Luke, like Han and Leia and Chewbacca, right?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** You know, it's like, and then like Han, Lise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:20]** And D'Artagnan was played by Chris O'Donnell, but the star of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** Chris O'Donnell, that's Robin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** What is he doing now?

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Is he a real estate agent?

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Is he still acting?

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** What is he doing?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** I have no idea.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** I think he's probably acting.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** I thought he was from Miami.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** But I was going to say this.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:35]** The guy who stole the show on the Three Musketeers from 1993 was Tim Curry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Tim Curry?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Oh, man.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Oh, God.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** He looks like a hobbit in this movie.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** But I guess he is Robin from... Yeah, that's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:50]** Here's a fun and embarrassing fact about myself is I went and saw Batman and Robin in the movie theaters with my friends.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** And the opening credits, it's Batman.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:59]** And then the Robin symbol flies up and overlays the Batman symbol.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** And I was like, wait a minute.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Robin is the bird?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** Because I always thought it was Robin as in Robin Hood.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Turns out it's both.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** It's like a combination of them.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** But yeah, as a kid, I was like, that didn't... That was like a revelation to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I was like, whoa!

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** I forgot that too.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:21]** Anyways, speaking of revelations... I didn't even know it was about Robin Hood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** It's a little mixed up.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** I should know all this a little better because my son's named after him.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Yeah, Grayson.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Yeah, Robin Grayson.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Oh, shit.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Of course he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** Man, revelations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** How did I not know that?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** Plus, Kevin is a huge, like, Batman comic book guy.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Just ask him.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** So that makes sense.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Don't ask him about... On video now, you can see this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** Look, those are comics there.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Those are comics there.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Don't ask him what the best Batman movie is.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Those are comics there.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** There are no good Batman movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** Well, it's obviously not Batman and Robin.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** Yeah, but that... It's obviously the first one.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** But the best of the worst...

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** It's got to be, yeah, Val Kilmer was pretty good, right, Kevin?

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** So George Clooney.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** Was George Clooney the one with Mr. Freeze and the nipples?

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Is that the one you like?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Batman Forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** It's classic.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** Batman Forever is the best live-action Joker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** With Jim Carrey?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Jim Carrey as the Riddler is the best live-action Joker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Who's the Joker?

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** There was no Joker.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** Oh, I get it.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** I get what you're saying.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Because that would be a good Joker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** Jim Carrey as the Riddler in that movie was so bad.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** but he was a good joker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Like that's how a joker should be played.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** I could see that happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Hot take.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:34]** Well, before we waste any more time, like we're getting off topic here, I really want to talk about, there's two things that I have listed.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** One was simultaneous switches.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I have that in my notes.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** It was supposed to be a keyword for John.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Okay.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Yes.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** You get one minute flat.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** What the hell?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Starting my timer.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** What is this about?

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** To explain what's going on.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** I don't know.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** I wanted to rant about him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** I recently heard on another unnamed show.

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:03]** of a device that they were like, all right, all of the PCs, we have to flip the switch at the same time.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Right.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** In order for Y output to happen.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Right.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:15]** And I just thought, what mechanically, what actual system needs a simultaneous input?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:22]** And again, we're talking multiple input to one output, but it has to be timed at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:27]** A little tricky, but it would be if you had a piston, right?

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:32]** If you have one piston that had four levers to raise it up.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Okay?

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Stay with me for a minute.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:40]** Each lever was a quarter of the piston's bottom surface.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** And the trick was you had to get it to rise up a certain height.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** It would take every player to hit exactly the same time.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:52]** Otherwise, that piston would get cocked enough and you would lose your momentum or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:55]** That would help you with a mechanical device.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** Yeah, like a mechanical force needs to go through.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** This, in this scenario, was electrical.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** And I was just like, I don't... Electrical's a little easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:10]** I mean, I'm not an electrician, but I remember drawing out different kind of switches that are... I forget what they were called.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** Low voltage relays, and I don't remember...

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:37]** like are you talking about like an application it doesn't matter just what keys just what physical or digital like analog or digital system when they launch a missile don't they have a key that they have to but does that key have to be at the same time or is it just that you're recognizing i think that there's within a time frame like you can't have you can't put one key in and then go turn the other key that would right that's the failsafe

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:42]** Yeah, because you have to have two conscious actors committing to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:45]** Right, but you're saying there's a time constant.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** Whatever is receiving the signal says that it has to be within one second.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** If you've got really long arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Yeah, what movie was that?

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** There was a show recently.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Or two long sticks.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:58]** Somebody wrapped a belt around it and pulled the one key at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** You might be thinking of Severance.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** No spoilers for anybody watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I thought it was... What is Severance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** It's the best new sci-fi show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** It's not even sci-fi, but it is.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** That's not the one with the banjos?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** That's Deliverance.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** It's a sequel to that movie.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** Got it.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:22]** I really wanted to talk about Vinny's trip to Los Angeles.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** But?

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** I think we're just running out of time.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Vinny is coming to LA.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** You wasted it with a simultaneous conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** You asked.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Vinny, how was your trip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** I don't know.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** I don't think it's time.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** It's a full 15-minute explanation, right?

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** It really is.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** I think that's a long question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Great teaser for our next banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Yeah, perfect.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Done.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:45]** Okay, give me a one-sentence preview.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** We already did.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Of what?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I want another one.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** That's like the trailer part two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:52 - 00:11:04]** Land, dinner, packing, sorry, land, breakfast, packing, nap, shower, shopping, gig, packing, desert, pseudo sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** A lot of packing.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** This sounds boring.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** I mean, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** The thing is that we're not going into the details.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** We're going to just move into our game then.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** There's no way to encapsulate it in a single sentence.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** There's really not.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Entirely too many activities.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** Okay, we will definitely talk about that next week for sure.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** But now I think we should play.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** I think we really need to jump into it.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** I'm a little nervous about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Okay, so.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** Yeah.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Before we play, do we want to talk a bit about what we.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Oh, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** I got this.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** I got this.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** I wrote this whole thing.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** I'm going to just read it off to you.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Here we go.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** This is my recant of last week.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Your recant?

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Okay, so.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Yeah, recant.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Take me back.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** I'm recanting last week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Well, I guess we are recanting.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** Alright, so last time hit the fan.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Big bleep on that one.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:58]** You spent the whole game fighting a radioactive Thestarian K'vok.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** It popped up out of the ground and chased down Termay and knocked him out.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:26]** uh you did all or you did some damage to it but you if you stay near this thing it's going to kill you because of radiation alone uh to me you're unconscious on the ground and you're within that aura of radiation if only there was some way to block radiation like if you had a sheet of lead or maybe like a two-foot wall of water or environmental protections on your armor from episode eight yeah

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Yeah.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** So, okay.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Last episode was really messy.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:34]** It got like, um, there was poisons, radiation and near death experiences.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:39]** In fact, uh, Terme, we know somebody else who gets like cut scenes whenever they get close to death.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** So did, did Terme get a, does he have a cut scene?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Is he seeing God or having a flashback of some sort?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** No.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Okay, I was just curious because you know Barry.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:54]** Anyways, when we stopped recording, I was super distraught.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** I thought the whole fight was completely botched.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:00]** We'd have to like control, alt, delete, hard reboot.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** But it turns out we don't.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** It wasn't all that bad.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** We can fix this.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:20]** i messed up turn order i yeah i skipped chalk in round one and for whatever reason i also skipped her main round two and we moved into uh thaddeus and so thaddeus got two round or two turns in the first round

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** So we're just going to undo that.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** I'm going to take you guys over to the map real quick, and I'm just going to show you.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** I'm going to move back Thaddeus to where he was before.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** So player screen.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Boop, boop, boop.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Rewind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** I got to go over to roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** Yep.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** I'm just going to do control Z a couple times.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** That works.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:44]** And then the other big thing that we really screwed up on, and I should have caught this.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** It's in the book.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** I'm just a bad GM.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:48 - 00:14:13]** the environment protections so let me i just want to read over it a little bit uh i have it all up here environment protections from the book page 349 i think um it says space can be an inhospitable place with countless dangerous worlds within it unless otherwise specified all armors protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least two days

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** Most of these common environmental dangers can be found on page 394.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** So just two things real quick.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Activation for your environmental protections.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** It takes a standard action to activate.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:29]** If there's somebody unconscious or a helpless creature, it takes a full action to activate somebody else's equipment.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:35]** And the duration of equipment, you can have basically the number of days equal to your item level.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:52]** is how many hours you get and you have to you can burn it in our increments but you don't have to burn it all at once so it's not like activate once and it runs through okay okay last thing before i take a break and breathe radiation armor protects against low levels of radiation

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:55]** Page 403 talks about radiation.

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:01]** Armor with environmental protections grants a plus four circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:09]** Armor of seventh level grants immunity to medium, but provides a plus six against higher levels.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:33]** no armor bonuses are applied to your saves against your radiation sickness key here is we were dealing with low levels of radiation um so your environmental protections should have been enough to protect you completely immunity thank you to john for going back and verifying this turns out back when we were walking over that toxic river rolu termay and choc turned on their environmental protections

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** So please, the three of you, remove any effects you had from radiation.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Okay.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** And take back your three hit points.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** Terme, I didn't actually take three hit points from you, so you don't gain three hit points back.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Thaddeus...

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:54]** You were not in the radiation until your second turn, which should have never happened.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** So you can also remove any effects you had.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:05]** But you're going to start your turn in that radiation field, and you are not wearing your environmental protection suits.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Does that make sense?

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Yes.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Is that clear?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Does anybody have any questions?

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** No.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** I am just... You all look very somber all of a sudden.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** I just drained every...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** I'm not somber.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** I'm trying to get everything back in rule 20 here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I messed that up.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** There was a lot going on in that episode.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** It was very tense.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** It's still a very difficult fight for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** But this is a question for the listener.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:49]** Have you ever dealt with a combat or even just a conversation in a game where something was forgotten, something was mistaken, something was messed up to the point where you guys just completely reverted back to before it even happened and said...

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** That didn't happen the way it did.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Let's just go back.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** I'm glad we're not doing that here.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** We're stepping back one turn.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** But let's get into it.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Let's get into it.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** Leroy Jenkins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Leroy Jenkins.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** All right.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:09]** So where we are now is the top of round two.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Okay.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** And you guys can all see the map.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** Just for the listener, there's a big open sand field.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** Rolu is off to the side near this escape pod.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Chalk had kind of stepped further away.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:30]** The Thestarian K'fok had come down and slammed, or I think clawed actually...

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:37]** Torme knocked him unconscious and Thaddeus is standing right above your past Torme.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** It is now Torme's turn.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:45]** And we talked about in the last episode whether or not you could delay because you were very concerned about radiation.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** You are now two things.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:58]** Just reading a little bit more is you only take that DC minus 10 damage the first time you're exposed.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:06]** So if you were exposed to radiation, you would only take that DC minus 10 damage every time you entered that field.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** So if you left and came back, I think you would take it again.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** That's an argument we can have another time.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:30]** um that's what we did for book two yeah also you're wearing environment protection so that's not going to be affecting you anyways so the question the argument we had and i i'm the gm here i'm going to side with it is whether or not you could delay your turn that still stands i will say that as an unconscious person you have an action a mental action ability to delay your turn so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** So before we move along, I also want to take an opportunity to say thank you to Kevin.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:41]** As a GM, it's really hard to just like, hey, I got this wrong.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** This is what we need to do to fix it so we can move the game along.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** And it takes a big person to do that.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:54]** So thank you, not just for your work to make all of this right, but also your willingness to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** You're welcome.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Agreed.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:02]** I kind of like playing with you guys, and I don't... Will, you had a comment or question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:06]** No, I thought John was going to pipe in about how I can't delay.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** Nope, he has no say here.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** I actually put him on mute.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** No, it's okay.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** If you want to, it's entirely up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** The meeting host, so I think only I can put... No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** We'll fix it in post.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:26]** I think it's a perk of having... Because you can only delay to the last party initiative, right?

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:31]** So as part of... I think I rolled like a 20.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** an initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** Yeah, you're first in the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** I'm first in initiative.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** It's like my privilege of being first in initiative that I can delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** This is Kev's game.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:43]** I think the argument was like, you're unconscious, so can you do that?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:47]** But really, you're unconscious enough that you can just wait.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:52]** Yeah, I think the joke I made was like, you're at the pearly gates and you're like, no, I don't want to go back yet.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** I'm just going to hang out here for a little bit.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Can I just hang out here?

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Yeah.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** So I've got a water.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** You do what you got to do.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** It is.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** It is top of round number two.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** It is Treme's turn.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** But you are unconscious.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:09]** You are stable because Rolu stabilized you with some magical spell thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** Yeah.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** The spell stabilized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** So you are stable.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:16]** The question is whether or not you use, I think it's an RP point to gain back one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:21]** I'm going to delay into the last in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** You're going to delay to absolute last.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Okay.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** I'm going to move you down.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Cool.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:33]** And that takes us to Thaddeus' actual second turn.

**[00:20:33 - 00:21:03]** right this bug uh this guy is still um he still has some kind of status effects where he so so you before you do anything else right you are in the radiation zone right it is low radiation but you do not have environmental protections so i need you to roll a fortitude save okay and i have to google what that fortitude save is because i forget i think it is well i don't pass it i'm sure but go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Why?

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** How bad was it?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** It's just like a five in total, which isn't good.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** So.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** DC 13.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Probably DC 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** So what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Five.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Five.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Okay.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** So you take three points of damage.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Okay.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:22]** And you are now radiation goes constitution.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Yeah.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** So you are now weakened, which means that you take a minus two penalty.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:30]** Your fortitude saves, constitution checks, constitution-based DCs.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:38]** Every time the victim attempts a fortitude save against the poison, whether it succeeds or fails, he loses hit points as per the initial exposure.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** So... Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Yeah, radiation's vicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Dude, it's intense.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Yeah!

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:54]** But another thing we talked about is with radiation is as soon as you leave the radiation field, you are no longer affected from any of that.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Yeah.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Unless you get radiation sickness.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** That's a whole separate track.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** So if you get out of the field, you are safe.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** The other thing is if you put on your environment protections, you'll technically be out of the field.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Because it's low.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** You have your turn.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Yeah.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** That's the key.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** Yes, it is low radiation.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** What are you going to do, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** The final boss has high radiation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:42]** spoilers yes uh thaddeus is gonna take uh a full round to move twice as fast your horrible bug boss uh cannot make attacks of opportunity if i remember correctly because it is poisoned and flat footed yes so thaddeus is just gonna skate right by and be like and he's gonna go all the way up here i imagine a nice soft shoe as he goes past


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:59]** i actually thought you might have helis and you like engage the helis it's sand man you can't do that on sand that's so okay so you leave the radiation area so you can remove your weekend um yeah but you are still not wearing your environmental protections i'm not yeah reminding you that

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** And it's the end of your turn.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** Yeah.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:06]** It is now the K'fok's turn.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Dang it.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** Dun, dun, dun.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Dun, dun, dun.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:16]** And I think what the K'fok would do is it just watched you skedaddle past it and its eyes locked onto you.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** It feels the vibration.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** And so it is going to travel up towards you.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** No way.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** Bum, bum, bum, bum.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Bum, bum, bum, bum.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:31]** Oh, I think it can only go 30 feet, so it's going to get right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** Where is right here for all the listeners?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I'm moving.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** It's going to travel up through that field, that open field.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** North, northwest.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Ah.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Closer to that truck.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:48]** It doesn't get close enough to you to do any attacks, so it'll actually take a second turn and move close enough.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** So it's right on top of you, but it can't attack.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** It's just able to move that far.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** Tricky part, though, is you're back in the radiation field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Yeah.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** Well, I'll take my damage next round.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:01]** Thank you.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:09]** Just a reminder to Rolu, we should try to kite this guy, which I'm currently doing, apparently.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Let's go.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Feel free to kill him.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:16]** Hey, guys, we should kill this boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** What does that even say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Shoot him in the back, Rolu.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Shoot him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Shoot her!

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Shoot her!

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Jurassic Park, everybody.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Great film.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Spoiler.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Well, before I forget, I think, let me see.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** I got to double check my calendar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I haven't seen it, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** You've never seen Jurassic Park?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** No, it's a joke.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** It's really awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** All right.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** So you are now stuck in that area.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** This is the end of the K'Fox turn.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:47]** And it is now Rolu's turn.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Okay.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** I have weekend on here.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** I'm going to delete that because you are not weekend anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** I'm at weekend.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** I took that off, took that beep away.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** And you were not.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:06]** So now, um, just for the listener, the, uh, Kafak and Thaddeus are up close to the, um, the, the wrecked hover truck.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** Uh,

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** And there's a large field of sand.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Chak is just outside the radiation field.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** And Rolu is kind of down south.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:22]** And then Termay is down to the southeast and opening into this field.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Yes.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** So, Rolu, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Am I flanking from where I'm at?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** Because I am about... You're not flanking anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** We talked about this.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** You can't flank unless you're melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** Yeah, there's no such thing as ranged flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** That's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Great.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Roller's going to pull out his pistol.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** He's going to full attack on this beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** Wait, question.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** You're going to pull out your pistol and full attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Sorry.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Not going to pull out my pistol.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** My rifle is out and ready to go.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:54]** And I'm going to raise it, then look through the sight, then take a full action shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I was just saying, because that's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Doesn't matter what you're saying.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** 15 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Oh!

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Oh, man.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** And this thing is poisoned, so it has a minus two to its ACs.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Yes.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** So that does hit.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** That's the first hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:13]** That's going to be three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** And then the second shot.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:16]** Rings out.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** I love it.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** 14.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Does that work too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** 14.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Tie goes to the roller.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Seven points more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** And it's dead.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** I'm kidding.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** There's a lot more to go.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** That is the end of your turn though.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:35]** It is.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** And now it is time for Chuck to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** Okay.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** Chuck.

**[00:26:41 - 00:27:05]** the raxalite is uh actually i don't care about being outside the aura anymore he's going to level his hunting rifle that he pulled out previously look down the sights uh i imagine the kafak notices it and just like brushes it off because it looks like a toy and then you hear this gargantuan boom

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:25]** amazing as a shot rings out that ooh um that's a 16 on the die 18 is the roll and that hits yes it does i'm gonna use my starfinder d8 for five damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:55]** all right you see chalk like stagger back a little bit under the force i picture like he puts his vines out to kind of stabilize them from the recoil yep but like it's sandy so he's still he sinks a little bit quickly so is that is that the end of your turn yeah all right it's still up and now we are at the bottom of the initiative order termay it is your turn i'm trying to remember the name of the action that i can do staying alive stay in the fight stay in the fight


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Is stay in the fight where you come up to one HP?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Stay in the fight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Yep.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:09]** If you are stable and have enough resolve points, or if you are knocked unconscious from non-lethal damage, you can spend one RP...

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:32]** beginning of your turn and regain one hp i'm no longer dying i immediately become cautious and can take the rest of my turn as normal there it is i'll allow it so all right because wait what does that mean for your stamina though it doesn't do it it's just my hit points yeah it's one hit point well like he was taking radiation damage no no no uh he was actually knocked out by an attack

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Got it.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Yeah.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Yep.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Sorry.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** Yeah, and I had my environmental protections on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** So he was unaffected by the radiation.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** My bad.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** It was just a raw attack that hit him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Benny, there is no ranged flanking.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** We've been over this.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Gosh, dude.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Jeez.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Sorry, I was just doing my inner Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** That was good, Kev.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** Vinny might actually argue it well enough that I let it happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** Kev, can you put this condition thing off of me, off my character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** No, you're dead.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Stay dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Well, anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** This is a Kevin game, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** Terbay's going to come to his feet, and he's going to, you know.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** be a little... Actually, I have to stand up, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** You do have to spend... Is that half your movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** I think you also lose your weapons, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** You did drop anything that was in your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** All four of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** So I think, yeah, you just kind of spend your whole turn just getting to your feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** Getting his crap together.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Yeah, I guess that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:30]** I'm like, you are alive and well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** That thing really knocked the wind out of me.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Uh...

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:52]** You know, if we could kite this thing maybe into this scrappy pile that we identified earlier, we could be like the gates of Thermopylae and the mighty 300 I hear from antiquity.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** I don't know.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** It's an idea.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** Anyways, I'm going to try and summon a creature next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** Fun fact, it was actually the 300 Skidamanders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** 300 skidabands.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Benders.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** Minor wrinkle that they got wrong with the movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Yeah.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Cool.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** That is the end of round two.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** That was a fast round compared to round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Yeah, it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Let's move back to the top with the new initiative order.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Thaddeus, it's your turn.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:24]** You are back in that radiation field and you're not wearing environmental detections.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** So please take three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** I have to roll a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** And roll me a fortitude save.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** You take damage either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Wait, wait.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Why do I take damage either way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Because that's how radiation works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** Because when you enter the field, what does a fortitude save prevent me from getting?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Taking damage the next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Sickened or weakened or whatever the radiation track is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Oh, the status.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** Yes.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Well, I pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** I think it's only radiation.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:49]** All other poisons, you would maybe negate that.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** I'd have to read it more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** I thought...

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** that the 42 save affects whether you get the disease too.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** When does that kick in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:55 - 00:31:01]** With radiation, I think you have to get at the second tier of radiation poisoning to get radiation sickness.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** There are two separate tracks there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** They are two separate tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Yeah.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** Which we will explore more in the main show.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Say again?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** Because Colin has radiation sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Colin has radiation sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:20]** I took three damage and I took three damage and it was an 18 on the 42 save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** Okay, so you're not weakened, but you take... Oh, shoot.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Sorry.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:31]** Before I forget, I was supposed to roll a Fortitude save on my Kefauk when it was their turn because of the radiation track.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Or, sorry, the poison.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** So, two things with the poison for the Kefauk.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:39]** You shot the Kefauk with a poison dart.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** The cure for that is one save.

**[00:31:43 - 00:32:04]** i have to continue to roll for four turns either way so basically from my understanding is he is currently it is currently sluggish if i fail the fortitude save i move to stiffened if i pass up the fortune save i go back to normal but i still have two more turns that i need to roll a save for so let me just roll my save

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** That's an eight on the dice.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** So I move into sluggish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Nice.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** No, sorry, stiffened.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** Stiffened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** And I don't have stiffened on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** You're carapace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** I think it was pretty similar to sluggish.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:29]** So Stiffen says the victim loses a dexterity bonus to their armor and can't take reactions.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** So I don't think there's really any effect.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:38]** And you can correct me because I'm a new GM, but I don't have the breakdown of their AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:41]** Just subtract whatever the bonus from their dex is.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Yeah.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Okay.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** So that's all that you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Applying armor takes full turn?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** No, it takes standard action to... Turn on.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** Turn on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** And you can do that in Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** You can also turn on... That's the problem, is I don't see a deck save for the creature.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Not deck save.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Plus two.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Yeah.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** So I take another minus two from my AC.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Man, that's making this fight real easy for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:07]** What a swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** You can roll blindly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Yeah.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** I think I'm just going to roll blindly.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** I think that's a minus six, too.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Your attack roll.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** I don't think that's in the book.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** I'm going to close my eyes.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Rolling blindly is a minus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** All right.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** So it's Thaddeus' turn.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** So what are you doing, Thaddeus?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:33]** Thaddeus supplies the armor and then is going to move past Kefauk again to here.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Can you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Oh, I can't take any AOS.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** That's amazing.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** No, you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** I cannot, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** So you're moving back down towards Treme again.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Yeah.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** You're basically playing monkey in the middle, but by yourself.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Yeah.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Go attack someone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Leave me alone.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** Gosh.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** Well, conveniently enough, that's the end of your turn and is now the K'Fox turn.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** I have to do another Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** What'd you get?

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** That is a natural 20.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Oh.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** So I'm going to pass, go back to sluggish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Whatever.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** So that's back to 14 and 12.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:17]** Do you really jump from one to the other when you pass for the two things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Yes.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:21]** So from my understanding, there are other poisons that say you have to have two consecutive saves.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** So a save would just keep you in place.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** A second save would move you back down.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** But this one is one save is the cure.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** So every time I roll a success, I move down.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** Every time I fail, I move up.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:44]** And then, like I was saying, if I move all the way down to zero, I still have two more rounds because it's up to four rounds of fortitude saves for this poison.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Okay.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:49]** So if I can get to zero at the end of those four rounds, I'm good.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:52]** Otherwise, I continue to roll to get back down to zero.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Got it.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:59]** And conversely, if I get up to staggered, I can continue to roll to get back down to zero.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** One cure at a time or one round at a time.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Cool.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** Ah, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** I lost track of where I was.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** So, okay, now I'm back to Sluggish.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** That is my Fortitude save for the round.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** It is the K'vok's turn.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:17]** The K'vok watches Thaddeus run past it again.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** And now he's getting a little winded, and he's like, no, I'm not going to deal with that thing.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:32]** And the K'fok spots the little plant monkey thing that had the giant gun blow up at it and took some good damage, and he's going to charge.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:41]** And by charge, I mean he's just going to step over towards it and do a swing.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Do a swing.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:47]** That is a nine on the dice for a total of... Twenty-three.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Twenty.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Twenty.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** It's just twenty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Stop it.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Fifty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** That is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** That's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:59]** Yeah, I mean, there's no chance he's not going to hit at level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Okay, all right.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** So that is then... I'm going to roll this big dice here.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** You see... How big is the kefuk?

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** It's large, right?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** It is actually a medium-sized creature.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** It's the size of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:33]** you know it's the size of everybody else you're standing with right so like as as the kafak approaches jack you just like see him the shadow he's just like and it just kind of slices directly down oh man um that is three on the dice for a total of seven points of damage slashing type which slashing against a plant is pretty vicious huh

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:38]** Yeah, I mean, it's like... We've all seen a machete go through plants, right?

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** You don't take extra damage, though.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** You're not... I'm pretty sure it doubles.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Just for flavor.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** I mean, this isn't Pokemon.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** It's a flavor double.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** It's not super effective here.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** It's a flavor shot in your coffee.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** It doesn't really mean anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Well, I put four pumps in mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** It looks like a big cafe, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** Can I ask, where does that...

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** leave you?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** You're still alive?

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** That's all I really want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** No, I'm not going to tell you, Kev.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** You have to tell me if you're down.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** That's my only question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Yeah, that's privileged, dude.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** It's either you're up or you're down.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** I just need to know so I can put a little X. He's non-binary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** He's just there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** He's there?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** He's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Yeah, no.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** He's fine.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** He's up.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** He's vertical.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:23]** Not for much longer, but he is still vertical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:23]** Hey, man.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** I'm not being judgmental here.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** I just want to know if you're up.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** I just need to put symbols on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Are you going to say that you don't make the rules?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Because


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:53]** because you do i don't you do no you can't have both ways you can't both make your own rules and say that it's paizo's rules you can't do that i'm the judge and and paizo wrote the laws so what rules did he break none no i don't know there you go yeah cool cool rolu it's your turn

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:58]** I think Rolo seeing Torme get up is going to say, Torme, take care of yourself.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:03]** And he's going to shout to Thaddeus, Thaddeus, we need to keep this beast away from Chak and Torme.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:09]** And Rolo is going to start moving, I think, up near Chak.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:15]** He's going to run up to the northwest across this open courtyard.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** And I just imagine that...

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:25]** just from the day from being out and exploring as he's running, he's feeling his armor and there's like sweat down his body and just the humid air.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:30]** There's just all this, like, he's just realizing how intensive a fight this is in this environment.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:39]** And, uh, he runs 25 feet to the Northwest, then going to attack again with the serpent laser.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** That was horrible.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:44]** That's a six on that shot.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** Do you need me to tell you that it misses?

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** I don't know, man.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** You don't make the rules, so you're just the judge.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:52]** It's up to you, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** I'm letting you know it misses.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Okay, cool.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Thanks.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** I figured you could surmise that yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** No, I mean, I didn't say it because I was letting you be the judge.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** That's a trivial question, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** I mean, what is trivial?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** I'm just saying.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** What.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** The what is the trivial part.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** What.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** What.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** What.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** What.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** That's your whole turn?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** You move, you shoot, you miss?

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Good round.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Okay, moving on.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Chuck, it is now your turn.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Chocolate's at a groan.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** You see him shake off the hit.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Picks up its leaves.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:33]** And he, if I can remember the keyboard shortcut to not lock into spaces.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Nope, that's not it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:37 - 00:40:01]** it's alt oh it's option because i'm on a man option all the same thing there we go cool he moves to the other corner of this square closer to the kafok oh interesting um and actually that's just for flavor because i don't think you can move less than five feet in starfinder um uses i'll let you take a guarded step inside of that square

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:05]** Oh, I was going to use my move action to do something else.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** Oh, okay.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:11]** Ben, he's going to stay in the top left corner of that square to be compliant with Kevin's rules.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:20]** And he's going to yell at this Kefauk, not in my face, not again.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Okay.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** Using his not-in-the-face ability.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Nice.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:35]** He's going to make a DC 13 will save or take a minus four penalty against attacks against me.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:40]** Thank you, Jeremy, from the Discord, for letting me know that that works on K'Vox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Oh, because they're not mindless.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** No, they are mindless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** Because they can still hear him.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** All it has to be able to do is hear him.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** It doesn't have to have intelligence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** It's not a mental effect.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Sorry, was it Fortitude save again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** DC 13 will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Will save!

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Will save!

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** Four.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** So it takes a minus four penalty to attacks against me.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Okay.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:21]** And I'm going to take my hunting rifle, put it right underneath its whatever looks like a chin and pull the trigger.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** I want shock to take this thing down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** So that's only good against you.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Yes.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:35]** Another just curious question is like, is it one of those things that like later on you can level up and use an RP point to do it against everybody or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:42]** Or is it just, that's just, um, later on I can use an RP to, uh, negate the saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Okay, cool.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Nice.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Nice.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** All right.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** Tell me what damage or what's your hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Here we go.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** That's a 17 on the die, so 19 to hit.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:52]** Nice.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** You're rolling, Tate.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Here we go.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** Wow.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** That's a six.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Six piercing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** Six points of damage.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Man.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:09]** So you pull the trigger, and then you see little K'vok teeth start showering out of its mouth.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Is there an AOO from that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** No, he's flat-footed.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Perfect.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Yeah.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** He, it, it is flat footed.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Don't assign pronouns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** And that's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** That is your turn.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Terme.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Good turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** It is your turn.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** This has been a fun round.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** I'm, I'm excited.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** Cause I like, it was so dire last time.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** I was like, man, I'm going to TPK you guys.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** It's going to be sad, but it's just, I'm looking, I'm, I'm feeling for you.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** I'm, I'm rooting for you.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Terme, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:50]** Termay, seeing all this, getting to his feet, is going to summon the energies from extra dimensions.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:56]** And all of a sudden, next to the K'vok, there's this bitter cold.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:05]** There's bitter cold as this shadow creature from another realm appears before him.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Amazing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** I mean, I don't want to question this so bad, but I saw you measuring it out earlier.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Dude, it's a normal spell.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** It's just the rules from Heisman.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** It's fine.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** This is summon creature, I'm assuming, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** Yes.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Summon creature.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** It's on my list of creatures that I can summon.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Okay, give me a second.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** What is this creature called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** It's a shadow creature, first level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:32]** I'm just going to type shadow into my search options and pull the first thing that pops up from the web.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** It's what size character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** Tiny magical beast, extra planar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Tiny magical beast.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** You guys get a spider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Yeah, look at that spider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:47]** Shadow spider, because spiders are creepy scary.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** They eat insects and they're amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:52]** You might want to shrink it, since it's tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** I know I had to hold alt to do that, because you can't just...

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** So it appears in this square.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** Can you remove your circle so I can see the map?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** All right.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** It appears it is now its turn.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Is that right?

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Or do you want to move?

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** You can still move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Well, I'm going to move after.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** That's cool.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** I mean, I can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** Yeah, I'm going to make you move now just so I don't forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** I'm going to say, well, it's a free action.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** I'll be like, let's kite it into this jug heap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** And then just nope.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:27]** Out of the area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:42]** So Torme is going to actually, he casts ahead of him towards the Kafak, and then he's going to step backwards out that entryway and back towards the tunnel where you guys had to pass through earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:45:10]** tunnel i thought it's uh it's like a crevice canyon canyon yeah it's very tight it's very tight toy toy so the uh i'm gonna put shadow spider on my initiative tracker so i don't forget shadow okay spider uh he's going to the shadow creature is going to attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:18]** Man, if you could have just cast it on the other side, you could have actually gotten flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Real flanking.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Because it's melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** Kevin.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Does a 24 hit?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** Just takes a long sip of this coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Wait, what is the bonus on this thing?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** I don't know, Kev.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** I rolled a 19 plus 5.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** So yes, that hits.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Tell me the damage.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Not bad.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Not bad.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Seven points of cold damage.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Dude, nice.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** Seven points of cold damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** We're just destroying this guy.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** Let me just double check to make sure this thing doesn't have like a cold.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** No, there's no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Okay.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** I was gambling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** That's good.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** No, that's fine.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** That was fantastic.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Okay.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** I am good.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** That is the end of round three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:08]** And I think the shadow creature has movement also, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** You'd have to read your rules on summoning.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:14]** I think when they first get summoned, I'm going to say it's probably just one action or move.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Is that right?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** No, it's a full round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** It's a full round.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Okay.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:24]** So he's going to move towards where Treme came out.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:27]** He's going to move out of the square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Cast run.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** He also runs away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Attack run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** He's trying to kite it.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Bring it this way.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** We could corner it in this junk heap and maybe it'll die.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I don't know.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Maybe not.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Maybe it's a bad plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Okay, I might not just be tracking this right.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** That was the end of round two, I believe.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** If it's three, don't get mad at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** That was the end of round three.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** That was three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Okay, we're on round four.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Thaddeus, it is your turn.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** Just a reminder, you are still not wearing environmental protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** I am wearing environmental protections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** I thought he put them on last time.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Okay, you're right, you're right.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Sorry.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Man, there's a lot of things moving real fast in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** I thought that was trivial, Kev.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** Like, you just knew, you know, that he put them on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** What is trivial?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Everything else is not.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** That doesn't make sense.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** What?

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:17]** Okay, so... I'm reading Hitchhiker's Guide right now, so 42, everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** I look forward to you finishing that two years from now.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Page a day.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** This is going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** I'm like a quarter of the way through it after six months.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Yeah, so that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Yeah, Kevin reads slowly, everyone.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** All right, so... Nothing else?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Thaddeus is going to shoot.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** That's fine.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** That's no problem.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** I'm just joking.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:39]** On a target rifle, which has a range of 60 feet, Thaddeus is going to move far as...

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:43]** And he's going to roll his new gun that he won from Rolu.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Son of a bitch.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** Yeah.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Let's see if that works.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** That's a 23 to hit.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** I'm assuming that hits.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** That hits.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** And it's four damage piercing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Amazing.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** Oh, man.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Beautiful.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** I do have to just question this.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** Did you have this weapon out before you moved?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:07]** And if you didn't, you can check your bonus attack ability.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Base attack bonus.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Base attack bonus.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Your BAB.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** If you have a BAB of one... Actually, wait.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** You're a soldier?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:46]** I'm a soldier yeah so I think you probably have it yeah I think at level one you start out with a baby of one let's check real quick soldier yes it's on here somewhere you start out with a plus okay I turn what does that mean exactly that means that you a bonus attack bonus or an attack bonus is just like and it's a bonus applied to everything but in Starfinder if you have an attack bonus of at least one you can pull a weapon while moving so that means that this is a valid movement and ability laugh

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** You pulled the shot off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** So what kind of gun is this?

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** This is the auto target rifle.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:59]** So you'll actually like hear it go because it's kind of like an automatic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Nice.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** But you're not firing an automatic mode, though.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** That's a full action to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Yeah, correct.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Correct.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Yep.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Sure.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** It's four damage.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** Yeah, four damage doesn't sound like a lot, but... But is that enough?

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:19]** You know, this thing, it flailed up against...

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:48]** chalk and it swung and stabbed that thing and then it got hit from behind by this spider thing and then Thaddeus being Thaddeus shoots this thing in the eye from across the field his eye explodes but it's pissed it's now the K'fok's turn the K'fok stands up in the sky and stretches out its arms and it lets out a vicious shriek

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** And it goes to swing at Chuck.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Come at me, bro.

**[00:49:53 - 00:50:03]** But instead, it topples over and hits the ground so hard that it causes a cloud of sand to come up and fold off.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Oh, my God.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** And that cloud starts to blow.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:11]** It actually starts to blow in your direction, which is interesting because you guys are all over the place around this thing.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** But each of you feel the sand blowing towards you.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Oh, man.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:20]** And you start to feel the sand prickling against your skin.
