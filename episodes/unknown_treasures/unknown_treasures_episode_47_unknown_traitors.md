**[00:00:32 - 00:00:43]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** Get in.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** I'm really happy.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** Yeah, we're usually recording pretty late with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** But it's still... It's funny because, yeah, it's early for you.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:05]** It's early for me, but it's still... I have the full day in front of me from the morning.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** This morning, I went to Home Depot with Grayson.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** I took my son and...

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:32]** what purchases did you partake in yeah i had to pick up a toilet um my toilet was wobbling and uh i didn't i went to go bro i went to go tighten the like the two you know there's two nuts so i put i popped the cap off i went to tighten the nut and the whole bolt just snapped off and i was like fantastic so i'm gonna replace my toilet um so is it the toilet or the flange

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** Well, the bolt is part of the flange.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** I got to take the toilet off.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** But I was like, I'm just going to replace the whole thing anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Yeah, do it.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** You're already there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** But I went to go pick that up.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:45]** I also picked up some grass seed because I want to get my lawn look better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Scott Turf Builder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Yeah.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Some tall, tall fescue.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:57]** But I was rolling around through Lowe's with Grayson in a cart and having a good time.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** And I picked up the seed.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** I got the seed first and I went to the car and dumped it off.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** And as I was putting the bag into the back of the car, there was seed everywhere.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:33]** i was like what the heck and sure enough there was a hole at the top and then i was like okay i'm just not gonna make sure i don't use it you know make sure it's vertical then i lifted it up that way and the seed came out the bottom so yeah i'm pretty sure i took it back i i was like hey this thing is spilling all over the place like can i get another one that i just swapped it and uh when i went to swap it there was rat shit all over the next one so there's definitely i don't know if it was still in there or not but they leave it outside

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Yeah, it's in the garden section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** It's not covered, though?

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** It's like a lean-to.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** It's not like an enclosed space.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** So you're saying Grayson might have a new pet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** No, I think we left it in the other bag that we left at the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** A rat, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** And I put the seat outside.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** Unless it crawled its way into the toilet on the way home.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** It's possible.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Apparently rats do that.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** They'll just come up through the toilets and then go back and stuff.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** It's like a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** That's a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Watch before you sit down.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** They do that.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Maybe in New York.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** Well, yeah.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** I mean, it's snakes here in Florida.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** And crocodiles, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Alligators?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Yes.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Even in LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** What do we have?

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Like a possum, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** We have possums here.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** We have mice, too.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:22]** I see them occasionally outside in Santa Monica, anywhere where it's moist.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** In your toilets?

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Moist, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:47]** moist moist anyways so vinny you're the other east coaster here let's not trigger vinny how was how was your day since your day is dude so i at one it's great living in the future yeah yeah this is mostly people who live in the future being like look at all this time i have with my day before i do this fun recording

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** I can do everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** I spent the morning turning wrenches.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** So my wife and I both have older vehicles.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Hers is a 2011.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Mine's a 2004.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** I like old vehicles.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** I love my Camry.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It's going to outlive me, I think.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:10]** And so she needed some engine mounts replaced.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** And so I replaced all four of those this morning.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:18]** I had to change my oil and I broke a I've got this thing.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** It's an impact wrench, but it's a battery powered one.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** And I've got a I've got a three inch one, which is decently powerful.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:29]** And I bought a half inch, which would like break my finger if I tried.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:33]** And I ended up breaking a bolt.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** One of the five bolts that holds your wheel on.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** On your wheel lugs.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** That's what it's called.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** A wheel lug.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** Broke it.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:44]** Snapped it in half because it was... I had too much Ooga Booga in the Ooga Booga machine.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:51]** So I had to get a big f***ing hammer from Harbor Freight and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Push that lug out and replace it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Yep.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Hammered it out.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Replaced it.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** Thankfully, Ooga Booga had enough to get the new one in.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** And, you know, it's a good time.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** I really like Harbor Freight.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** It's a good spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:07]** I know all about replacing lugs because I lived in Hawaii for a little while.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:12]** And there was a night that... Well, I don't know how it happened.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** It wasn't my car.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** But it was a night that the power went out.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** Apparently, a rat had crossed the transformer that powers the entire island.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** So the entire island was dark.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** And me and my buddy were down in Waikiki.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** It's an Ice Age situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:30]** Yeah, we were having dinner and we got the dinner for free because they were like, well, all your meals were on the computer and we lost computers.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Anyways, we were just like, what are we going to do the rest of our night?

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** We can't go back to our hotel.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** We lived in the barracks.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** It's like a hotel.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** We can't go back to the barracks.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** We might as well just cruise around.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:47]** So we're cruising around at 10 o'clock at night in pitch black and all of a sudden his car starts just going...

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** very weird.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** And I was like, dude, this doesn't sound right.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:56]** And sure enough, we get out and he had only one lug left out of the five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Nightmare fuel right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** I don't know if he, I don't know what, what happened.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** I don't know if he didn't like tighten them all up the last time he changed his tire.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:10]** And like, you know, the loose ones just sheared off with enough force.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:14]** I don't, I don't know what, what happened, but yeah, that is nightmare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** So like I've had, I've had that happen before.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** I had a... It was a 96 Jetta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** Oh, that Jetta?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Yes, that Jetta.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:33]** So I was driving around and I heard a quiet rattling from the front passenger side, but I thought it was just my suspension.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Something rubber had worn out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** You know, typical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** It's a typical car.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:47]** So I'm just cruising along and driving down the road to my girlfriend's house at the time and just...

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** Boom!

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** Boom!

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:57]** Turns out, because the Jetta has wheel studs and not like lugs and nuts, so the screw passes through the wheel into the hub.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:02]** The hub had worn out on all four lugs at the same time.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:06]** So like the screws were just slowly rattling out and rattling out and rattling out.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** And I lost all four of them at the same time.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:12]** The first boom was the rotor hitting the bottom of the rim.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:17]** The second boom was the rim spitting out and the rotor hitting the... The ground, yeah.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** The asphalt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Yeah, it's fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:21]** It's real fun.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** I remember you telling me that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** I just saw, like, there was a drift video.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** I think it was in LA somewhere.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:30]** And some guy's drifting in a circle and his back tire just can't handle it.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** It was flying off into the audience.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** And the best part was, it was like KTLA or something, like news.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:42]** And it had... They put, like, a little quotation box that said, like, I'm free!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:48]** Wow, I'm impressed that they did that.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** I love KTLA for their trolling the news.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:55]** It's good to see that there's a television news station that's actually not garbage.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I'm happy that it's at least entertaining.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Television news is terrible, usually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:04]** There was some 10 o'clock late night newscast.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:08]** They were interviewing people about some political thing or something.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** And they were like serious, serious.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** And then all of a sudden it cut to a guy in a SpongeBob costume.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** And he was like, oh, I don't know.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Whatever SpongeBob's voice is.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Thank you, KTLA.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:30]** Before we started this, we almost got into a discussion about tool preference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** I thought you were going to go with the Ugga Mugga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** The Ugga Mugga.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Were you soft leading into that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** To be fair, my Ugga Mugga machine is not from Harbor Freight.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Is it Milwaukee?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** I've got some opinions.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** No, it's Ryobi.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** I like Ryobi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** All my lawn stuff is Ryobi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** I'm a huge fan of Ryobi.

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:04]** So like there's a, there's like four Home Depots around here, but I've also got a direct tools about a half hour South, which is like, uh, they do Ryobi and I think it's Husky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Yeah.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** It's Home Depot brand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Yeah.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:14]** The Home Depot brands, like they're factory reconditioned or like, uh, remanufactured tools.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** So like the Ryobi tools are already pretty affordable.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** These are even more affordable and they have like the same warranty.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** So yeah, I'll go get all my batteries from there.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:33]** And it's both of my Okabugas are both of my impact wrenches are Ryobi and I'm a huge fan, but Harbor Freight for everything hand tool.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** No, if it doesn't have a battery, it doesn't plug into the wall.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** I'm all about some Harper Freight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** I mean, I don't know.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:44]** I haven't actually shopped at enough Harbor Freight for like hand planers or anything like that.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** But I like versatility in my tools.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** I think you pick the right tool for the right job.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:57]** And sometimes that tool needs to be a cheap disposable and sometimes it needs to be, you know, high impact.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** You need it to work every single time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:04]** Oh, I thought you were going to go on a rant about how you don't like Harbor Freight for whatever reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** No, I don't hate Harbor Freight.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Okay.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Well, here's my tool philosophy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** I just like having the right tool for the right job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Right.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Buy the right thing.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:19]** But if you don't know what the right thing is, buy the cheapest possible solution.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** And if you break it, you probably need a better solution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:27]** If you're breaking tools, man, you're wasting money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:50]** in my opinion sure that's true my two cents i don't know that i've ever broken a harbor freight tool though like all of my impact sockets are harbor freight most of my ratchets are i think i broke a torque wrench from harbor freight once oh that's interesting my torque wrench is from harbor freight and i've had it for like eight years yeah sounds like you're not working hard enough eddie apparently


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** I need to fix some more cars, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:58]** I need to fly out to Will's garage in LA and break some s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:07]** That's because f***ing Will's building a f***ing transmutation machine or some kind of transmogrifier or time travel, anything.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** He's always doing weird stuff, that's why.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** I'm just fixing cars over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** A drift engine.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Will's working on his drift engine.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** For legal reasons, I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:25]** I found out Will's actual age, and I'm not going to share it with any of you because I want to know only me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** It's bleep.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** No, no, no.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** It's bleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** Wait, did you find it out when we were at that party and then I left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** I did.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** You left it before it happened.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** So, sorry.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Oh, dude.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I know how old he is.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Carissa told me how old he is.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** It's not a secret.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Don't tell anyone.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Don't tell the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Hold on.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:42]** We actually know.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** I'm old.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** I'm between.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Is there anything alone who doesn't know?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Here's what I found out today.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Apparently.

**[00:12:49 - 00:13:14]** that your age isn't how old you are it's what level you've completed up to so it's like you've completed and you guys are level four let's play the game yes is that a good transition no wow okay sorry i mentioned to play i want to know where this is gonna go wait wait we have to do we have to do a free captain's thing we talked about that real quick kev kev where what is gonna go i think everything's fine it's all good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** Also, you're not old, Will.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** And then, like, you don't look that old anyway.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** You don't look that old anyway, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** What I meant was, like, you don't look that age that you are.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** I feel old.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:32]** I really hope that Thaddeus has that level of, you know, of compassion.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** No, not for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** None at all.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** So, yeah, let's talk about this for a second.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** Let's start off with a Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** Okay, Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** Starfinder story time.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Starfinder Storytime!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Thank you, my space children.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:59]** So today we're going to be talking about the Free Captains, of which all of our characters are members.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** So talking a little bit about them.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:08]** These pirates are ostensibly led by a council of elected pirate lords.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:19]** The Free Captains are an association of independent starship captains whose primary traits are freebooting, piracy, raiding, smuggling, and other enterprises that lie firmly outside the law.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:32]** What binds these disparate individuals together is the code they follow, which determines who can be raided, which ships can be stolen or scuttled, and perhaps most importantly, who has been granted immunity to such predations.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:48]** While the rules that compose the code may seem arbitrary or capricious, simply having a structure at all is essential to keeping the group working together, rather than devolving into a free-for-all that's easily mopped up by the stewards, who you will know from our three-fold conspiracy campaign.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:57]** Now, these rules are modified from time to time based on the whims of the ruling captains, and we can go over those rules another time.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:15]** But while the free captains range throughout the packed worlds and beyond, their center of power is in the Diaspora, whose scattered collections of asteroids, chunks of space rock, and plantesimals provide countless docking stations, ports, and safe havens for fugitives, outcasts, and pirates eking out an existence on the wrong side of the law.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:21]** And the Free Captain's Pirate Council meets on one of these asteroids, called the Broken Rock.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:33]** Though its precise location is a closely guarded secret, and the place is said to be exceptionally well defended, lest the stewards or a planetary police force seek to curb the Free Captain's extra-legal activities.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:50]** The Free Captains don't have much of a unified ambition beyond the piracy of their individual members, but intelligence reports in the highest echelons of planetary governments suggest a nascent pirate kingdom is emerging in the Diaspora as a result of the Free Captains' growing power and influence.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** And if you'd like to read more about the Free Captains, you can do so on page 476 of the Core Rulebook.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** At least 476 on the paperback version of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Yeah, we talked about this.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** Disclaimer, we don't know if the hardback... I don't have a hardback book, so I can't compare it.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:10]** Like, whether or not the hardback is the same as the... I would think it's the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:16]** I think it's just... They call it the pocket edition, but we were discussing earlier that it's effing huge.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** I think it's like 6x8 or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** I don't know whose pocket this thing fits in.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** A giant's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** I do have both, and I have to say... Hang on, let me pull out my Harbor Freight tape measure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:31]** Careful, don't break it.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** Alright, so you guys are all on the main page, correct?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** You're on the landing page?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** So let me just drop this.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Hopefully it works right.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Ah!

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** I made this myself.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:45]** I stole a lightsaber off of the internet somewhere.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:49]** Ideally, it's supposed to be a digital scroll.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** I tried to use AI to do it, and AI was like, I don't know what you're asking me.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** That's how AI talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** Prompt engineering, Newfield.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Kev rolled a two on his engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:06]** For the listener, it's basically a digital scroll that is projecting a screen up.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** And on there I have the tenants for the free captains.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** So I'm going to roll a dice for the last three of you guys.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:21]** Will, why don't you read off the tenants for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:27]** No free captain will attack another outside of council-approved duels.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:38]** Clients paying the Pirate Council's steep fees for protection must enjoy complete security from unwarranted attacks.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:48]** A deal is a deal, and once an individual free captain has made a bargain, he or she must honor it.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Or they must honor it.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Yes.

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:03]** All crew members are free to leave a ship in port, but once they are underway, they must fight to the death if their captain commands it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:08]** Man, I just... These are the rules of the free captains.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** I thought it'd be important to reiterate them.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** And let me just read over now.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Yes, I'm reading this.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Last time...

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:25]** With her last breath, the gray let out a telepathic screech, and you all continued your fight with the drift phantom.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Rolu missed out on a critical hit because... He sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** It's dark in there!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** And then the phantom slammed Rolu into unconsciousness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** And, sorry, that phantom was shaped like who?

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I don't know at the time.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** It was Thaddeus, man.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** It was Thaddeus' form.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Of course.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:53]** The phantom shifts into whoever's in the room.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** It basically cycles through.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** As the battle went on,

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** And on and on and on because I'm an idiot and I forgot how DR works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** This is the fight that ever ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:14]** But the important things that happened were Rolly went down and got back up after Treme stabbed him in the head with a healing serum.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** Treme was able to finally take out the drift phantom with a critical attack from his frostbite pistol.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** but not before Rolu was paralyzed in place.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** And we ended that episode with Thaddeus approaching Rolu and putting a gun to his head.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:40]** And before I take you over to the map, Rolu is paralyzed for 12 more seconds, and there is still a windstorm stirring and going strong.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:46]** Oh, yeah, and the lights are going to keep changing every approximately six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:50]** Now, don't, like, count down the 12 seconds necessarily as I'm talking.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** You can sort of treat this as, like, a vacuum.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Vacuum of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Sorry.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** I didn't get those notes going in there.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** All right, we're back to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** It certainly doesn't include narration, but yeah, go ahead.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** I can really just see a white blob.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** I just see blackness.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Oh, wait, there we go.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Oh, now I see it.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Wait, why am I outside of the room?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Kevin, you put me in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** That was my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Oh, weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** It was just a glitch in the drift.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Dude, this is messed up.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** I had to go back to the tripwire thing.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Thaddeus is in timeout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** No, I thought I put you back.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** I was using you to see how the dark... Now I don't see my character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** The vortex looks really great.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** I see a rainbow vortex, yeah.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** You're there, Will.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Pretty nice color.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** All right, so let me take you back to the map.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:46]** Just for the listener, we are in a large laboratory at the back of the wreckage of the Stellar Flare.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:51]** There is a giant windstorm spiraling at the door.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:57]** And the windstorm that I picked just on roll 20 is rainbow colored because it's cool.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:06]** We have the drift drive kind of in the center is busted and broken and the dead gray is sitting, is laying in the middle of it.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** And Treme is kind of standing over her.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:18]** And then we have Rolu and Thaddeus standing just to the west of that and Chak kind of north of them.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:24]** So before we go back to what Thaddeus was doing, which is walking up, putting a fist to Rolu's head, um,

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** I'm going to put us technically back into initiative order.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** We're still in initiative order.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** So I'm just going to start off the top of the round.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** It's going to be Rolu's turn, but you're paralyzed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** What are you thinking about in those six seconds?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** This is after Thaddeus has put his gun to my head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Yes.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:45]** So Thaddeus has a gun to your head and he said, freeze to you.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** There's nothing you can do about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** I imagine he's thinking about, like, doesn't care about the gun at all.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** He's just imagining, like, brush strokes for different constellations.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** There are two parts of Rolo.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** Part of him is thinking about brushstrokes in an attempt to stay mentally calm.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:16]** The other part of him is trying to figure out what to do next.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** And it feels a little bit like a pre-gog thing.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** Maybe he's trying to think ahead to what's going to happen.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:28]** And part of it is wondering, is just anxiety, nervousness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** I'm nervous for you.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Has Ralu already seen what's going to happen as a precog?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:37]** Has he precogged this situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Do you die right now, Ralu?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** That's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** Did you see your comeuppance coming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:53]** There is a... When the gun is pointed at your head, Ralu feels a familiar feeling of a gun pointed at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Chalk, you're up.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:24]** chalk is incredibly curious about this object that he didn't want to give up and so he moves to the corner nearest uh rolu he's like hi rolu i think i'll take that off of your hands and goes for the what formerly glowing blue object okay so roll perception check it's yeah it's not glowing anymore

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Right.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** Can I see the glowing thing?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:31]** It's not glowing because you guys are... Can I see the glowing thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:31]** You cannot.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:37]** So you guys were in magical darkness, and that's why you saw the glowing magic.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** You're no longer in magical darkness.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** You're just in dim light.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** Actually, you might be in dim light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** I don't remember.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** 19 is the perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** 19!

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** So your vines are running up along... Does it tickle?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Yeah, you start at the ankle...

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** Pat down one leg, get up, get right into the crotch.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Sorry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Sorry.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** It's awkward.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:01]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:09]** And then as you're coming up the other leg, you can feel, you feel like a latch or something.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:12]** It's definitely not a pocket.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** It's almost like it's a hidden compartment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** Is this a hidden compartment or are you happy to see me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** And I'm going to say that was your action.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** Oh, is that check Thaddeus?

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** Thaddeus observes this happening and he knows what's going on.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** He knows that he's going for the puck.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:40]** He still has this for me and Venom caster like pointed at roll his head and he has this enormous eating grin because he's been waiting for this moment.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:48]** He takes out of his pocket the star map that Shaak got off of his body, and he unfurls it in front of Rulu's face.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Lookie, lookie.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** We got this off of you the other night.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** I know what you did, Rulu.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Look at this.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** What is this ship?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** The Nova Rider.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:06]** The very ship that your old captain here has raided.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** You're not a pirate of the Free Captains.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** You're a traitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:19]** And that, that pug, you were going to give that to Hears, weren't you?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** Well, the Free Captains are going to squash that little bug.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** And you'll get to watch it all happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** From the brig.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** Now Shaq, to me, restrain Rulu.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:37]** And Shaq, give that puck to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Termay, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** What are you doing?

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:47]** Uh, Termay hearing this is gonna perform grave awards on the gray.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:54]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:21]** delivered that was absolutely delivered oh my god uh i really want to though but um i'll do it after i tie up rolu with uh some cord somewhere oh wow i don't know if i have any though what am i supposed to tie him up with anything you have don't you have some magic that you can use uh no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:46]** not in this situation uh we'll just do what you can to hold him down and be careful he's very okay check check just fine to his right hey i think there's some cords going from this table to the wall you might oh yeah there's some cords over there i can go grab great uh so i'm gonna do that and then i'll try to tie him up i'll grab these cords that are 35 feet away


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:47 - 00:27:09]** i'll grab these cords i'll grab these cords they're like only they're closer to to the situation right so you're gonna you're gonna walk kind of right in between rolu and uh thaddeus and towards the computer that the gray was at and just yank cords right out the wall and rip them off the computer yeah i guess so

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** All right.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** And you're still within range.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** So that is your move action.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** And I guess your standard action would be yanking the cords off.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** Yeah.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Okay.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** It's going to put us back to the top of the next round.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:24]** Rolu, you have one more round of being paralyzed.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:34]** Rolu still has that familiar feeling of the gun pointing at him, which is giving him...

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** A small bit of trauma and anxiety.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** And he's confused.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:49]** I believe when Thaddeus calls him a traitor, he's confused.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:54]** He hasn't thought of it like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** All right, Chalk, are you going to attempt to pull the puck out of the secret compartment?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** So you know where the compartment is now.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** Or are you binding him up as Thaddeus told you to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:07]** Yeah, I'm taking the puck.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Have you met me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:20]** John, you might have to correct me on this, but is this going to take some kind of engineering check to open your compartment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** No.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:27]** Concealed compartments technically only gives you a plus five to sleight of hand when hiding objects.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:32]** So I don't think there's any issue for you to open it, unfasten it, whatever the mechanism is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:40]** So let's just roll a sleight of hand check against... I mean, he's going to see what you're doing anyways, but I think it's a DC 20.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** I'll aid.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Oh, look at that.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** I think it's fair.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** I'll give that.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** I'm not sure if you can actually aid in sleight of hand, but I'll allow it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:52]** Look over, if you just use your vines to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** I think I've seen this kind of compartment before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** This is a good one.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:58]** Good tip.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Good tip, Jermaine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:03]** All right, so the DC for this is usually 20, but can be modified.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** I'll keep it at 20.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** So roll me a sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** It's a 26 without aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Wow.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** It's the power of the vines, man.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:28]** I like to think like the vines kind of just like completely wrap around Ralu's leg and squeezes and then like a little bit of it pops up and yanks the puck in your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:38]** I'm going to grab the puck and then I'm going to like run over to on top of what I assume are some shelves on the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:44]** She's standing on top of the highest shelf you can find.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** I just climbed on top of the shelf.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Keep away.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** Like a Tusken Raider.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:56]** Needless to say, Rory, you're relieved of command.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** Now we're going to escort you back to the ship.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** Be a good boy until we're there.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** But first, we need to finish our job here.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** Torme, see that he stays put.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** Torme, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Right.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:20]** Listen, Rolu, just explain yourself and we can go back to being civil, I'm sure.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:26]** But for the meantime, I think it's best if I were to tie you up now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:31]** And Tremé's going to bind as best he can.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:37]** I'm assuming there'd be, like, an engineering, maybe, I don't know.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Athletics?

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** How do you bind somebody up?

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Survival?

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Strength?

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** I don't know.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Survival could be it.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** You've got to know how to tighten up.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Yeah.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:53]** Control amount?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:18]** i'm gonna mount you're just gonna mount roly there's a mechanical the mechanical aspect is you actually have a bind um and the target is entangled it would be the proper that's what i think too okay so i'm not even gonna make you do a dc on that because it's to bind somebody during combat i think is the way it's looking at it and we're not technically in combat he's useless rude

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** So, yeah, I'm going to let you say he's automatically bound.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:27]** Go ahead and put an entangled condition on your character, Ralu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** And then I'm going to walk over.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Well, I can't.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** That's fine.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I can't do it.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** I still want to cast grave words.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** I want to see what that does.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** I want to know what that alien was trying to do.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Naturally.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** One step at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:48]** Sorry, you did go over and... No, I don't have enough movement and actions to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Maybe I'll move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** No.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Wait, he's tied up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Yeah, he's tied up.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** All right, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Good.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** I mean, whatever that means.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** He's entangled.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** Are you holding on to his bindings or did you just tie him up and let him go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** Uh, I have control of him.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** The reins, I suppose.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** You're pulling them along with you or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** Well, I haven't, I haven't moved over to the gray yet.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Right.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** I would say I'd like move to the other side of him cause I was maybe wrapping him.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Sure.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** Cool.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:25]** Cool.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** It's just toilet paper style walking in circles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:35]** No, like, like a mummy, like a, like a party Halloween party mummy of toilet paper.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** You're going to tape me to the wall.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:40 - 00:33:02]** okay it is the end of the second round it has been 12 seconds rolu you start to get incitation it kind of starts at your fingertips and your toes and it works its way back towards your core and you now are completely free of paralysis i'm going to keep you in initiative order though uh what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** Visibly, fingers start moving.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:15]** Shoulders start trying to pull out of the binding that Termay has put on me.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Look, you all know me.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** You all know that I'm not a traitor.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:26]** Jack, I need you to just give me the puck right now.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** We can finish our job.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:35]** I can explain this to you civilly without being bound to

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:41]** And we can go back to the ship and this will stay between us.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:47]** You have the wrong enemy, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:50]** You're in no position to negotiate, ruler.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** And we all know we can't trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** Thaddeus, I don't know that I'd go that far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:10]** Listen, I just, I want to hear the whole story before I make a judgment call, but that might be a little easier if you're not trying to hide things from us, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:19]** I have good reason for trying to hide this stone, and I've saved it.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Your lies, you have saved mine.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** We are a group, and I look out for you as a family.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** Or at least, that's what I thought as he's looking at Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:37]** So, so here's... Thaddeus, go with me.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** Rolo?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** I believe you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** But there's some pretty d***ing evidence to the contrary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:54]** You're referring to the schematics of the Nova Rider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** The schematics?

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** The fact that I saw you steal something from the captain's office?

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** The fact that I noticed you take something off of Tinkerton?

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** You've been acting sketchy ever since we got down here.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:09]** I think we are all owed an explanation right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Hold on a second.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:16]** Thaddeus, do you mind hanging on to this cord here for a minute?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, gladly.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:25]** Thaddeus goes behind Rolu, keeps the gun at his head, but is holding onto the rope from the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** With the gun behind him, Rolu's anxiety increases even further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Are we still in initiative?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Yeah, I guess so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Sorry, yeah.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** I'm also still trying to read up.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:41]** I think that I'm going to give you actually grappled as well as entangled.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Oh, damn.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** Because grappled is you actually holding on to him, and I'm going to give that to you automatically.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** But you're also entangled because now you're tied.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** So you're stepping away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:52 - 00:36:04]** Yeah, I gave the court to Thaddeus to grapple Rolu, and I want to move over to the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:16]** And I'm going to conjure up, I'm going to pull in the mystic energies and say, Grey, tell me your secrets.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:22]** Explain to us your motive for this puck.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** And I'm going to cast grave words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Jack starts giggling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** I love this part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** One in ten chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** God, Kevin.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** That was the Grace speaking in Aklo.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** And since you guys all speak Aklo, right?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** You guys all speak Aklo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** Let's just say yeah.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** I do.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** I have Aklo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** Conveniently took Aklo on your level up.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** Since you guys all speak Aklo, she is saying...

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** Drift.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Open.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Drift.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Shut.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Drift.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Open.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Drift.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Did you guys all hear that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:17]** And it's kind of just repeating that over and over and over again until she falls dead again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:24]** I think this puck might have something to do with opening and closing the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Can I investigate the puck first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Do you have mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** I do.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Okay, so sorry.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:43]** Going back to... We are stepping out of initiative order because Treme kind of jumped ahead of Chak and Thaddeus.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** So Treme, that was your turn.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** No, you're fine.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:51]** Chak, it is your turn and you're going to try to analyze the puck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:54]** Yeah, I want to figure out what it is, where it's from, why it exists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:59]** I'm going to say, unless you have mysticism, I don't know if you can.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Cool.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Can I do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Not on Chuck's turn.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Chuck tries to figure it out, but has no frame of reference for this object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Guys, I have no idea what this puck is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Let me see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:14]** Rulu, what is this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** It says what?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** It says Harbor Freight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Just got to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Nice.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Amazing.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** All right, Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Thaddeus is just responding to Shaq.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:42]** He's like, it's fine for Rolu to try to explain himself for a little bit, but I'm not going to let him go until we get back to the ship.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** It's too risky.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:49]** And I can't believe, I can't be sure that he's going to give us a truthful explanation.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** So Rolu back on the ship, we can talk about it.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** But I don't think it's going to be, I don't think it's going to turn out good for you.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** But you can defend yourself there.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:10]** Like I said, from the brig, for now, we need to figure out what we need to get from this place and give it to that android, Bari, right?

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** So let's finish the job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:16]** All right, so I'm going to take us back to the top of the round.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:27]** And Rolu, whatever you do now is going to determine whether or not we stay in Nish of Order or get out.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:32]** And just play this through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:36]** Shock, do you... Do you promise...

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** To give the stone back to me.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:43]** Because that is, you have the wrong...

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** You have the wrong enemy.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** You need to let me go.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:56]** I can't go back to the ship and have this trial in front of the captain and everybody.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** No, that's not acceptable.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** I won't let that happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:05]** You're full of explanations, but come on.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Come on, Rolo.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** You don't provide specifics, so no one can believe you.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** If I tell you, if I tell you,

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Will you let him go?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** It's a starting point, but you're not in a position to negotiate, like I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:23]** How could we agree to that terms without knowing what it is we're agreeing to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** You know, he thinks we're idiots.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Hang on.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** Listen to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** I don't think you're idiots.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** You just don't know what you're meddling with here.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** So what is it, Rulu?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** You don't know who's in the wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** What is it?

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Rulu, you're right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** We don't know what's going on.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** That's exactly why you're tied up and I have this puck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** By the way, let me see that puck if I might try to look at it.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Check.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:52]** I've learned some new things in the, in this past five minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Check throws the puck, the terminated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Do I have to do like an athletics to catch it?

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Forearm?

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** What is your dex bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** My dex is plus one.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:27]** yeah roll me an athletics to catch it i got 17 actually perfect all right so you just he tosses it to you you catch it catch it um i'd like to uh identify magic item as part of a detect magic

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** Use Mysticism to identify the property and command words of magic and hybrid items.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** The DC of this check is 15, plus 1.5 to item level.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:43]** You can usually attempt a Mysticism check to identify a magic item only once per 24-hour period.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Further attempts with that period fail.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:56]** However, casting an Identify spell allows you to attempt a second check in the same 24-hour period and grants plus 10 insight bonus to the check.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:09]** If you have the time, you can take 20 to attempt another check to identify a magic item in the same 24-hour period, but only if you can perform research such as access to an information network or downloaded data set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:14]** So do you have what it says identify is a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** I have detect magic.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:23]** So the first part of the spell or the mysticism for part of it says as part of the action to cast detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:31]** You can use mysticism to identify the properties and command words of magic and hybrid items.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Okay.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:42]** So yeah, I'm going to attempt 18 on the die plus three, or sorry, plus five is 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:46]** I'm going to leave that to John to tell you what you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** What's the item level?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** It's not for you to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:50 - 00:43:13]** there's not a level to know per se it feels like it's connected to something larger but the composition the feel the sense of magic it feels like a base element building block like a like a star metal would


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Yeah, I don't know what this thing does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:27]** 23, it... It would be like picking up some really... You know, it's like picking up any other element and being like, this could do a lot of things.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** But you're not quite sure what it is.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** You haven't seen a star metal like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** This is a piece of a larger hole, I believe.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:39]** Is there... Based on nothing that I can really glean as to its specific purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** Right.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Is there any clue as to why the Grey was looking for it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** Well, I kept...

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** Badgering on about drift open, drift close.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:51]** It's got star metal, whatever that means.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** I don't know.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** He listens to Kiss.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Nice one.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Deep cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:01]** Rulu, why was this grey looking for star metal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:07]** I... I was asking them the same question.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:10]** I wanted to know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Alright, so...

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** Should I take you out of initiative order?

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Or, like, it's still technically Rolu's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:25]** Look, if I explain, I hope that the three of you will let me go.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:30]** I don't know entirely what this punk will do.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** It could, no.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:35]** Why don't you want to go back to the ship, huh?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** I'm happy to go back to the ship.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:43]** I would love to go back to the free captains, my family.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:48]** But there are others who are interested in this stone.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** And it's important.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** What others?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** I speak of.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** He means he is.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** I know he does.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** You wouldn't know if I told you, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** You wouldn't know.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** It's better that you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Hilarious.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** You.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** You see what I mean, both of you.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Benevolent censor, are you?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** A seven-year-old would not be fooled by this.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** All right, Rolu.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Now, we're going to finish the mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Unless anyone else has anything to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** Jack very loudly says, Thaddeus, enough.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Let him speak.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** He's spoken enough.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Hurry up, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** Yes, Hears is important to me.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:34]** That should be obvious by now.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** You all have known this.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:40]** The schematics only allow you to make this charge against me valid.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:45]** But Hears was the only one who could see what the issues were.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** and like me, could see what might happen.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:54]** And he suffered more than any of us should, and his actions prevented the suffering of many more.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:58]** But he is not connected to the stone.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:05]** The stone... Do any of you know N'Krall?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** I didn't think so.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** So as it is.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** What is that supposed to mean?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:20]** You all could try and make a culture check or something like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** I'll leave that to Kef.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** I'm not trained in culture.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** Or mysticism might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** I got a 24 on a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:34]** Let me roll quick.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** I have plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** I think that's enough to know it.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** At least something about it.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** 17.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** I have to Google it myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I've heard that one before.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** I wouldn't Google it too much.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** I'll say that.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Yeah, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** So, John, what do they know then?

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** You are aware.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Dual GMO right now.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Oh, God.

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:13]** You are aware, Treme, of a Barathu entity that has been known to issue predictions quite successfully.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** For large events.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Think like Nostradamus.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:30]** And Confluence is a melding of many Baratheons as they are a leader of Prithiva, right?

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** And by extension, Leovara.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:47]** Nekral is another melding of Barathus, but legend has it that they've melded with tech that allows them to algorithmically become clairvoyant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:53]** A very interesting thing for a precog to embark on.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:59]** Some technological wonder, to be clairvoyant, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:06]** I don't know that this puck will, but you understand now that there are many others.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** I am not trying to betray the Free Captains.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** I did not do that with Hears.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:17]** In fact, we worked hard to prevent the Free Captains from sullying their own reputation.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** There are others who are interested in the stone.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** And I'm surprised that we are all pirates here in this room.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:33]** That you would think that we are all altruistic to just the free captain's interests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** That is literally what we are.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Only altruistic to.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** That's our job, Rowling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** I mean, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** We took our oaths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Exactly, Treme.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** We took an oath.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** I took an oath.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** As will.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** And I am upholding it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Are you saying pirates are altruistic?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Check.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Is that what I heard?

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:59]** Check hops down as all of this talk of the oath comes down and mumbles to himself, oh, they're more like guidelines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** Come on, come on, come on, come on.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:09]** He ambles over to Thaddeus and says, Thaddeus, give me the paper we stole from him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Thaddeus hands it over.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** Rolled up.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:26]** And he looks and is suddenly reminded, not at all because Kev DM'd me, about the partial coordinates that he saw on Gray's computer screen before all of this fighting ensued.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:37]** Especially during the fighting with the gray is when you try to turn off the drift drive, you saw that information kind of on a Word doc on one of the seven screens that are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:44]** So, like, do I recognize those coordinates as any part of this document?

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Or, like...

**[00:49:47 - 00:50:02]** I guess I'm going to pull out my data pad and search those partial coordinates to see what star might have burnt out, where the star metal came from, and to see if this document schematic has anything related to those partial coordinates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:08]** Give me... Would that be a physical science check?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Piloting?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** I don't know what that would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Well, I don't have physical silence, so I'm going to hope it's piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Physical silence.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:28]** maybe survival like orienteering i'm trying to think there's like a lot of different things um let's do let's just do i'm gonna say culture check okay it's probably the best 14.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** You're looking through – you looked at the paper.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** You kind of scanned it real quick.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** You didn't really see any numbers of significance on that paper.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:39]** And the ones that you do, they definitely don't line up with the numbers you saw on the computer.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** Okay.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:45]** And honestly, your remembering of what you saw on the computer is still a little blurry.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:51]** It's like looking at a license plate but not actually remembering to look at it, if that makes sense.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:57]** The other thing, you're scanning through your computer, but you guys are inside the Stellar Flare and don't have data access.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:06]** So you're just kind of cycling through whatever Wikipedia pages you already downloaded, and there's nothing in there that's significant enough to piece together much of anything.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** Look, I'll answer your questions in time, but can you release me from this bindings?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Don't do it.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** Give me the stone and we can finish our mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** I don't know if you should be holding on to this stone.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** What I just told you.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Yeah, because we can't verify it.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:29]** And if what you say is true, then we'll verify it later with Goldhorn.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** You're staying put.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Here's what I'll say to that.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** I'm going to hold on to the stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:42]** And he like tucks it away under some like leaves, but also like shuffles it around his body.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** I think I have the stone, don't I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Do a sleight of hand check for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Treme has the stone.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** Oh yeah, Treme has the stone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Treme, would you mind tossing it over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** Sure, what do you plan to do with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** I'm going to hide it in my vines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** Here, take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** It's garbage to me.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:09]** So that is a terrible roll.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** I'm going to use my covert.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Oh, fudge.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** I was going to use my new ability since we're level four, but I can't.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** That's a 12.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:23]** Okay, and who is trying to oppose this?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** I guess it would be definitely John, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** So go ahead.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:32]** It says that you can check a pose to a perception check of anybody observing you or searching your body.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:37]** In the latter case, the searcher gains plus four bonus check.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** That's if you're searching your body, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** Yeah, I'm not searching.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:44]** I got a 24 to notice where it is, perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** What did you roll, Vinny?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** 12.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** 12.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:57]** So yeah, you're shuffling it around and you put it down your pants and Rolo sees it very clearly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** It's just a big bulge in your pants.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Bingo.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** So Jack shoves it into his pants, but it's like this obvious bulge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** It's just like a hockey puck in your pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:14]** Are you happy to see us or is that a puck in your pants?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** I'm always happy to see you, Trey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** I have robes I could hide in that, right?

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** I think... Oh, sorry, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:32]** And after he tucks it away in what he thinks is a great hiding spot, he says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:38]** Thaddeus, Torme, I think Vrolu, if he was going to do anything to us, would have done it by now.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:46]** He's going to be far more valuable to us untied than he is tied.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Remember, we're still in a hot zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Shaq has a point.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** We all know that you think so.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** Um... Look...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** That is a dear call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** I'll stay close to you.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:05]** I'm not going to hold you, but I'll leave you tied for now.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Stay put and help us figure this out.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** If you help us with that, we'll untie you, all right?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** But you don't get the puck until we're back at the ship.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Deal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:27]** And as you were talking about that, the windstorm kind of slowly... It slowly slows?

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Yeah.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** And disappears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** How did the windstorm happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** It was a critical fail.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** There you go, Vrolu.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** That was an auspicious sign, wasn't it?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** So, sounds like a good path forward, right?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Let's move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** Vrolu has a wisdom of nine.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** And I don't know.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:52]** Rolu wants to trust you because of all that we've been through.

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:05]** And I, John, don't know if Rolu would trust that you all are going to act altruistically, as we've discussed that all free captains do, and give the puck back and let me loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Listen, a deal is a deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** That's what the code says, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:14]** If everything's on the up and up, you can keep your star medal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:35]** like you we follow the rules don't we you don't even know what you're meddling with that is just don't spew then why don't you tell us what he said enough he'll tell us later i don't need more pretentious rants from you we have a mission to finish so let's finish it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:40]** I don't want to be casting grave words on your body, Rulu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Yes.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** You don't have to.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:45]** You have the choice to let me go, as would be prudent.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** Rulu, we're spinning in circles here.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Thaddeus, I'm agreeing.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** All right.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Good, good.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** All right.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** I rolled a 15, so I'm agreeing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** All right, good.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Now, what do we need to do here?

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:00]** We need to research this computer, right?

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** We need to get in there somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** The one I just ripped all these cords out?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Yeah, so I'm sure... Well, we need the technology.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** He wouldn't have pulled the power cord.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:18]** He yanked out the cord for two of the seven monitors.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** So those monitors are down.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** The computer automatically adjusted because that's what computers can do.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Alright, so you guys want to check the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Sure.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** Let's get this technology and get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Right.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** Okay, so who's taking the lead on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:38]** Who's got the... I got a plus three to computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** It's definitely not me.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** No, I got a plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:44]** Jack, I can maybe try to help you out.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Maybe you take the lead on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Yeah, let's get it.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** Okay, so Chuck, you're going to walk over to the computer.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:53]** You kind of slide a chair over and jump on top of it.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Throw a couple books underneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Yeah, no, he climbs up onto the desk and dances on the keyboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Oh, just on the desk?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Okay.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** But as you're climbing up onto that, I need you to roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Ooh, 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Of course you pass.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:14]** So as you're climbing up on the computer, you're small enough, you're eye level with everything that's on that desk, and you notice that there is a

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** An intact metal bracelet.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:24]** Its outward appearance is quite stylish, but it doesn't belong with any of the other apparatuses in this room.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:32]** And there's a small panel on the interior side of that bracelet that is open and reveals circuitry.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** And there's wires actually soldered into it.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:46]** And those wires are connecting it back to the computer through a USB-T because we're that far into the future, which is A, B, C, D, E. Nice.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** So go ahead.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:52]** You can either give me a computers check or an engineering check on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** I'll assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** I wish I could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:57]** I think I've seen this one set of fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** It's not a great roll either way.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** There's grays and fries.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** At least a prize out here.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Did you succeed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Yeah, I succeeded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** I rolled a 19.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** Cool.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** You're like, man, this is a cool watch.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** I'm curious why it plugged in to the computer.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** It's shiny, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** Man, I had some good jokes in there, too.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Ignoring that, go ahead.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** Give me a computer's check for the computer itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** I will assist again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** 16.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** The computer explodes on you.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** Does anybody else want to try?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** As we know, computers are pretty hard to crack.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Can I try?

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** Is there like, can I detect before we start?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:53]** Can I detect any like countermeasures or fake shell or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** Uh, if there were countermeasures, a fail would have triggered them.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** So you see chalk working out at you.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Chalk is like just typing away on the computer.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:02]** He's not dead yet.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** So you're, you're probably fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Okie doke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** At least at this level, I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** Uh, do you want to help?

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** Yeah, I'll assist to make it 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** I assist to make it 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** I think that's enough.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:20]** So with like, you're, you are like so close to breaking into it.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** And chalk is like,

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** I tried that one already.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** That one too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** Nope, not that.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** And then you're like, okay, how about this one?

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** And you type in... Wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** What about this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Fifty Shades of Grey.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** That's the password.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** Okay, so... First...

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:52]** First, you look over the user interface for the drift drive, and though it's busted, you're able to actually adjust the computer power or the emergency power to stabilize lights in the entire ship to dim again, so we're not dealing with complete darkness.

**[00:59:53 - 01:00:05]** And then you're looking at the screens, and you can see there's the drift drive UI, and then there's the Word doc that was open with the gray information on it, and Chalk points to that.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** He's like, wait, go look at that.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Go look at that.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:16]** And as you dig through that, you recognize the grazed notes, and you see a drift drive, and you see a bunch of symbols that are the Aklo alphabet.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** Like wingdings, I'm assuming.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** But you can't make out the words, though.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** Why not?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** We'll get to that.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:52]** you do see the partial drift drive coordinates that you were looking for earlier and you see that blue cylinder kind of sketched with with like powerpoint drawings and a bunch of aclo notes around it you also see there is a file that's it's open on the other side it's a mini computer that is connected to that to the computer a midi computer a mini mini

**[01:00:52 - 01:01:18]** yeah and as as you're looking at this chalk you're going to pick up that watch and look a little bit closer and you actually see that it that watch itself is a miniature computer it's a miniature computer that can synthesize with an android allowing access to the data within it's a watch it's it's an android smart watch got it you get it android smart watch yep okay

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:25]** But in actuality, it is a tier two computer with two miniaturization upgrades and a security one module on it.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:30]** And what you know is that this you're able to click it and break into it.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Give me one more computers.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:31]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** I will not assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** It's a 20 on the day for 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:39]** Beautiful.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Okay.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** So you finally figured it.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** You're like, I got this.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** Once you're in, you're like, you already saw what this computer could do.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** And you recognize that thing and you're digging into it.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:59]** You reach the secure data modules that include VARI 8's research projects and theories on how to draw power from the drift.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:07]** This virtual treasure trove of lost facts and figures combined with the salvage of the partially working power core is exactly what Varya 13 was looking for.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:15]** That watch is Varya 8's personal watch that, shoot, I forgot her name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** Dr. Oh, crap.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Looking in the notes.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** Let me scroll up in the notes.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** I know, I'm doing the same.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** Dr. Nobu Sweeney?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Yes, Dr. Sweeney.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** That she basically warned Varya about.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]** She said, Vara, you need to put your documents onto an actual computer and not on this watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Hashtag data hygiene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Right.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** Okay, so that's what you need.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** to give Vahri 13.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** That's what she's, what they are looking for.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Cool.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** But you guys are all drawn to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:49]** Yeah, the tale of Sweeney's Keef.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:57]** You're actually more drawn to the Aklo and the Scribble and that puck and everything that's around in that puck.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:08]** So give me, give me a culture check and I'll let, I'll let any of you guys can roll a culture check for this because you guys all know Gaklo now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** I don't, actually, and I don't have culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** Then you cannot roll me a culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:15]** If you know Aklo, you can give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** 16.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** What is it?

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:18]** 28.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** All right.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:31]** So, like, all you are staring at this thing, figuring out Chalk finally points to it and says, like, I don't know what this says, but it's definitely an Aklo.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:43]** If somebody gives me an assistant, I would get... So, Terme, you know the alphabet and you recognize some of the words, but you're a linguist at heart.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:46]** You study languages.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:51]** And from what you can see, you can put together this form of ACLU actually seems to be almost archaic.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** It's very old.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** Probably around 300 years old.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** DC 30 complexity.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Right.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:03]** The language has evolved, but you know Aklo has evolved.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** But this particular script is written in old Aklo.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:25]** You also piece together that Malziox, the gray, wanted to use that blue object that Rolu has to somehow complete those coordinates and possibly help them open the drive to the coordinates.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:27]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Oh, wow.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** Wow.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:33]** Nice.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Nice.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:39]** Could you repeat that last part?

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Nope.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** Go back and listen to the tape.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]** It's necessary for the next episode.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:58]** Until next week, drift begones and distance stars.
