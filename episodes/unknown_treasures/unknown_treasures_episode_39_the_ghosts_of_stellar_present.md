**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:01]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** This is Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:07]** Unknown Treasures.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:08]** Unknown Treasures of the Unknowns.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:10 - 00:01:10]** Yeah.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:14]** I feel like we're getting close to the end, right?

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:16]** Like maybe the last leg of our journey.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:17]** Yeah.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:17]** We're on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:18]** Are we?

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** Maybe.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** Maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:38]** i don't know everyone i have no idea how to judge it and other people's discords that are talking about us like they're just like yeah i don't know when it's gonna end they just have never this eyes of concern i have the innate ability to turn a small uh standalone adventure into a full ap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:38]** It's our fault, too.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** Come on.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** It's really amazing.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** It's really amazing.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Yeah, we're taking our time.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** Yeah, I think it's mostly Kev's fault.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:48]** Let's just place the blame where it needs to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** It's fine.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** Now I'm putting this all in my pocket because I'm going to be able to criticize John when we get back to playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** We'll see.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** That's the exact opposite of my plan.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:02]** My plan was that you never criticize again because now you see what it's like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Now I'd be like, why are you doing that?

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** This is such a better way to do it now that I'm an expert GM because I've been GMing for a year and a half straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** Wait, you're going to become more of a rules lawyer?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:18]** You've started a terrible trend, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:44]** yeah this is horrible that's pretty bad hey guys I heard a really off color pirate joke this week since this is a pirate adventure get ready to edit whoever edits this episode is free to cut it out what's the difference between a casual party invite and a pirate casual party invite and a pirate

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** They have no idea.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** One says to come as you are, and one says are as they come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Oh, my God.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** That reminds me of another joke.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Amazing.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** That's pretty good.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I think we should keep it in.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** I like that.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** I like that joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** I had to let that sink in a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Yeah.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:09]** It's a little kind of a slow burn because you got to think about like, oh.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** Oh.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** Oh.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** Oh, wait.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:22]** That reminds me of the time I had a Halloween costume and I had a steering wheel sticking out of my pants and I was kind of dressed up like Jack Sparrow.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:29]** And I would go around and people would ask me, like, oh, what's this thing that you're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** It drives me nuts.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** It's driving me nuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:04:06]** beautiful I love that every time someone says it's just a casual conversation they're like oh man that drives me nuts I'm like yeah like a pirate will belt buckle no one ever gets up no no I'm trying to I just my memory sucks I used to have all sorts of stupid one-liner jokes and I'm sure I had some pirate ones in there and I can't remember the only one I can remember right now is what kind of bees make milk


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** What kind of bees?

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Boobies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** That's a solid dad joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Do you know how pirates know they're pirates?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** How?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** They think, therefore, they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:27]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That's a Will Garrett pirate joke.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** Yeah, that's what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:34]** That's a very Will thing to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Very deep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** We'll listen to, like, philosophy.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I'm sure everyone's got this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** I feel like Will, like, made that joke to, like, Descartes.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:48]** And then he was like, oh, hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** During his time travel adventures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Yeah.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Yeah.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]** My French is horrible.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** I clearly am not.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** I don't have any French NPCs coming or else I would have a better French accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** And knowing Will, he was like, oh, you're on a good path.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Stick to this one.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** It's really going to help you out.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** Because it ended real well for Dicker.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** But...

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:15]** Well, yeah, Pirate Talk's fun because you guys are pirates and stuff.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:22]** I was going to ask, I don't know if I... Have we talked about ghosts before on this show?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** We have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** I don't feel like we have.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** I feel like we've talked about a lot of things.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Have we?

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Yeah, back in the...

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:33]** back in the day, Kevin, Kevin talked about his like ghost experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** I don't know.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** I don't know which ghost story I told because I've got a few.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** It was the lamp one.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** The lamp one.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Okay.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Yep.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Yep.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** But go for another one.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** I'm down for another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** Go for it.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:44]** Okay.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** So I love ghost tours is what I'll say.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Yes.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Yep.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** I did a ghost tour of South Carolina, which was like Charles, like Charleston.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** And it was awesome.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** Cool tour at night in the dark.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** It's real creepy.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Um,

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** We didn't go into the buildings.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** We stopped on the corners and they would point things out to us.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** And they stopped on the corner and this place was called Pugin's Porch.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:11]** And there's a restaurant now named Pugin's Porch.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:16]** And it was named after the dog that is buried underneath the front porch.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Because Pugin used to sit on the porch.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** That's the whole thing.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** Dog has nothing to do with the ghost story.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** No.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:30]** The ghost story was that there was two women that were orphaned to their aunt and uncle and basically kept in the attic their whole lives.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** And so by the time the aunt and uncle died, the two women were recluses and didn't know how to live in society.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** So they lived by themselves.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** It's just two women.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** And then one passed away.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** And then another one passed away.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:47]** And the way that they found the second one was the milk bottles piling up on the front porch.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:48 - 00:07:15]** anyways so the haunting stuff comes from the restaurant the restaurant's been converted over or the home was converted over to a restaurant and there were a lot of weird things that would happen in the restaurant that like you would get your coffee mug and it would have lipstick stains on it and the waiter would be like oh sorry about that and just take it and replace it no questions asked and they'd swear it was clean by the time it left you know

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:21]** Uh, other things like candles coming back on after they bloom out weird little things.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:26]** The biggest thing was the, the women's bathroom was the old woman's bathroom.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:33]** And some women have claimed that they would see a little old woman in the mirror while they were washing their hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** Dude, that's creepy as super creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** So anyways, yeah.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** So we, we decided to go to dinner cause why not?

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** And so we went to dinner, had a great time.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** They had fantastic popcorn, Gator, delicious, um,

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:50]** And while we were there, we started talking to like the guy at the front and turns out he was like the son of the person that bought the place.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** And he had plenty of stories to us, including like he locked the back door.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:59]** And by the time he got to the front door, the back door was wide open and he had a friend with him.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** So he yelled for his friend, like, dude, that's not funny.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** And his friend came down the stairs.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Like, what are you talking about?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** Oh.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:30]** but he's like i deadbolted that thing weird stuff and so he's like man if you guys want to explore go right ahead like upstairs is shut down because it's like you know a late evening but if you guys want to go and we had we met a couple of girls that night so we were like hey let's go upstairs let's show you know i was trying to convince them to go into the bathroom and try to see if this woman would come out and they were like no we're not gonna do it so i was like you know what fine i'll go so i went i went into the bathroom and i turned in the water and

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Nothing happened.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** Absolutely nothing.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** So we're like, whatever.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** So we stepped out of the bathroom and into like the dining room, which the dining room was really cool.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** It was two bedrooms that they kind of broke the wall down in between.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:45]** And then just, they left the wallpapers and stuff of the two separate rooms and the carpet.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** But there's all one combined dining hall now.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:51]** And they're all these tables and the chairs were set up against the tables.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** They were like leaned into the table.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** So they're on two legs, but they're like pushing forward onto the table.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** Okay.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** We were standing there talking, just like BSing or whatever.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:12]** And at one point, somebody noted that there was a very definitive temperature difference along the seam of the room where the two bedrooms were.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** And it was just like, it was cold and colder.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** And it was like, that's weird.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** And we were talking and joking.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:24]** And then as we're joking about it, one of the chairs just toppled completely backwards.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Like...

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** And like I said, they're on two legs forward.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:34]** And like, uh, this is one of the things that makes me believe in ghosts is that like, uh, physics and art is explainable.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:39]** And the way that chair fell was not explainable by physics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** And so there was no gust of wind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:42 - 00:10:01]** No, yeah, no, we were, like, in a closed room, and it was just, nothing shook, and it was only one chair, so, like, the girls we were with, like, screamed and ran away, and my friends were like, I'm leaving, and I picked up the chair and put it back, and was like, sorry, and, like, left the room, but...

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Yeah.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Wow.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** That's creepy.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** The other ghost story I told was probably a little more involved.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** That was in my own home, and that was much more creepy, I think.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** But I love ghost stories.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** I wish I could experience more of them because I want to know the truth.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** I want to know, do ghosts exist?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Do ghosts exist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Do you not believe ghosts exist?

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** I didn't prove it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** I don't have any definitive evidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** I don't think you can prove it.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:34]** I think maybe someday, but I don't think we're there yet to prove whether they do or don't.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** But I wish that I've had ghost stories, man.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** I want them.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** I just haven't had them.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** I really do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:47]** All you got to do is go to the ghost tours and then go back to the places that the ghost tours told you about.

**[00:10:47 - 00:11:07]** but oh yeah speaking of ghost tours i'm sure the stellar flare is going to end up on ghost tours of uh kifak depot from now on so uh let's get back into the game let's play let's let's play you guys sound scared that's not actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:18]** No, I just want to see this beautiful, hauntingly beautiful Swedish metal band guy that's been walking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Oh my god.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** I put that up there as a joke.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:28]** So on our landing page, I just threw a picture of a woman with long black hair because...

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:58]** kelly thought it was a woman but it is a human male with long black hair is what jock saw that's fine kelly takes all types that are hauntingly beautiful and that's okay i'm fine with this he's very beautiful so last time i was able to coerce you to explore some of the rooms um the first room you guys entered was some kind of dining area there wasn't much in there except for potential junk um but on your way out rolu heard something

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:02]** When he turned back, there was nothing there.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:06]** Then Kesh and Merc came in on the intercom system.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:15]** After that, you entered the other room on the east side and you found an assortment of magic and technical items all associated with a drift.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:24]** Then when Chalk left that room, he saw a Lashinta woman with red hair in a lab coat walking up the east corridor.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** So creepy.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** But no one else saw her.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:38]** And as you guys all went out there to try to track her down, you then all saw a human man with long black hair on the opposite side of the ship.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:48]** On your approach to him, though, we paused at that intersection because you caught a glimpse of this wall of darkness that receded.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:57]** And as it receded away, you saw a couple of you caught a glimpse of a leg passing through the door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** And that's where we're into the game.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** So let's go back to the map.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Let's go back to the map.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** This is creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** Yes.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** This is how it's creepy.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** I literally have goosebumps right now.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** I love that series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** I felt goosebumps when Kev was telling some of these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** I forgot how scary it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Also, are you afraid of the dark?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:23]** The one with the kid in the waterfall, the dam, and the bike?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Oh, that was creepy.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** The scarecrows with the pumpkin heads.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Good times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** None of that in here, though.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** They were good times.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** Just good old-fashioned hallways of nothingness.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Alright, so we're back on the map.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:43]** The four of you are at that intersection that kind of zigzags its way back to the front.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:52]** And now you see that there is a door to the north, and then there are also two doors, one on each side of this little corridor.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:57]** And then the top of that large door there is a corridor that's

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:07]** It runs east to west, and you figure that probably wraps back around to connect to the two north and south corridors on the east and west side of this map.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Yes.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** All right.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** So what do you want to do next?

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:17]** Thaddeus is just kind of like, They went...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:22]** The shadow disappeared, and they went through it, and I see two doors.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** What?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Dead ahead, north.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Shall we go through?

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** Who were you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Did you not see it?

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** No, I'm behind you around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** I'm just gonna...

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** What's all this about?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** What's going on?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Oh, yes.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** I mean, I saw something.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** I saw the man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:48]** I saw that, you know, like at least two sessions ago.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** This is... That's what I was trying to tell you about.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Nobody believed me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** Well, it's not that we didn't believe you.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** I think that's a bit of an overstatement.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:02]** I don't even believe my eyes at this moment, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** I believed you, Chuck, and I believe you now.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** And I believe we need to follow it.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** That will be our key.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** What if, you know, what about these doors on the sides?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** We should get them on our way.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Okay.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** All right.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** I'll check as I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** All right.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** Let's go probably the one on the left first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** That's the one that this leg went through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** No, it went further along, Rulu, but go ahead.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** You were opening doors.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** You're a resident door opener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Kevin, it went through this door, right?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** It went through the door directly north.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Yes.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** Got it.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** The door directly north.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:49]** The double door at the end of this hallway due north.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** All right, I'm going to roll a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:25]** super strong roll it's a 13 to just on the door itself yeah just to see if there's any traps or anything see what's going on uh you don't sense any traps on the door and on the door it says data center kind of written on the little placard next to it daddy's rolled a 20 perception does he sense anything dangerous or no we're gonna go uh no no questions


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Okay.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:34]** With looking at the data center, is there another placard on this other door by chance?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Across from it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Yes.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** That one says study.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Cool.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** All right, Roto.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Chop, chop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Let's go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** So you're going to step in or you need to open the door?

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Okay.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Give me a second.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** I have to...

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** work on my magic tricks.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** Polygon Reveal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** How good is Kevin's Polygon Reveal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Whoa!

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** That's a pretty good one.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Polygon Reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Solid 4 out of 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Yeah, I have no idea what you see there.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Hopefully it's cool.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** 4 out of 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** All right, we'll step in.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** It appears to be...

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:19]** Some sort of, yeah, racks of servers, I imagine, and a TV or a display in the center without some wires cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:27]** As the door opens, you see a handful of server racks lie tangled in one corner of the room.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** Three overturned filing cabinets take up the opposite corner.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:35]** Their drawers hang open like the slack jaw of a dead creature.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Just kind of cool.

**[00:17:36 - 00:18:04]** there's a single computer console that stands bolted to the floor in the center of the room its screen is flickering a bluish flicker and you also notice there are windows that run along the north side of this wall that's transparent wall but it is there is like a glass there and that is probably the blue light that you saw earlier when you came up that western corridor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:09]** Can you move out of the doorway so I can go in?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** You're little.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** You can just wiggle around.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** Josh is a cop over me.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** Give me a perception check now that you're in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Give you a what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Emphasis on the shen.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** It's a 23 for my perception.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** 11 for Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** You see a computer there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** Dude, these are hot.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** 23?

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** I don't see anything.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:41]** Chuck, you should probably... I'm not the best at computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:50]** Chuck steps over to the machine and sees if there's any histogram readings or what is this machine used for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** So are you just looking at it, or are you going to actually start typing at it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** I'm going to start typing at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:09]** All right, so as you reach toward the computer, the moment you rest your palms on the edge of the keyboard, there's an explosion of electricity, and it arcs through the floor, striking you and Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Cool.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** What?

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** This is why I did not walk in.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Yep, figured.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Each of you need to give me a reflex save.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:22]** No, you need to give me a reflex save for punching you through Zoom.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Okay.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:32]** So you both get to take half damage from this.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Is this one a D12?

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Yeah, I think that's a D12.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** So this one is just for you, Chuck.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** It is four of these.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** Four dice or four damage?

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** 4d12?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** 4d12?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Wait, really?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** 2, 2, 2, and 10, so 16.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** You take half of that, it's 8.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:58]** I rolled really low, but it is 4d12.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** God dang.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** Of electricity damage, so you take half of that, that's 8.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** John, you take 4d6 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** Half of that?

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Curiosity.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** Looks like it almost killed the plant.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** One is eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Fourteen.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** So you take seven points of electrical damage.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Chuck, are you okay?

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:32]** Treme, when he peeked in and saw the windows, decided to go down the hallway just like a couple feet.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** And I'm assuming he saw, like, a flash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** Yeah, you walked right in front of the window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** You could smell the ozone.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Yeah.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** You could just see Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** His leaves just go.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Yeah.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Oh, poor Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Chuck is hurt.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Chuck is down to three hit points.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** Wait.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** You got the hit points?

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Dang.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** Wait, you have three hit points left.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** That's what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** Yeah.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Three hit points.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Zero stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:20]** shark are you all right you need to be chopped up there um yeah absolutely i think i think he just became a chopped salad i have more than three mark one healing serums of healing i think i will give one to you and roll loose hand shakily pulls out one of them trying to

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:34]** trying to exercise his muscles and Rulu carefully steps through servers to a square that is adjacent to shock and gives him a mark one serum of healing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:43]** So after that surge of electricity, you guys did hear a large, a loud pop as if like a fuse blew somewhere.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Oh, geez.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:50]** The computer screen went dark, but it doesn't look like there's any damage to the computer or even the surrounding base stand of it.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** You can give me a DC.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Sorry.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** I always say that.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** I was like, give me a DC.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** And I'm like, wait, no, don't tell them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Secret.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** DC.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** That's six points of six hit points.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Do you shock?

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** Perhaps we should take a 10 minute rest at some point soon.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Get your stem.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:17]** Hey, guys, I see at the end of this hallway, there seems to be a door behind this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** But before we do that, I want to resolve Kev's role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Ooh, beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Can I aid?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** Yes.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** That is a... I aid successfully.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** So 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** Unnecessarily.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:43]** You were actually, you're able to see that there is a faulty conduit that runs along the floor to this computer.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:50]** And that is definitely what caused the short to the stand of this computer.

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:15]** what you also know is that the computer is still functional and you're actually able to pull out a battery pack and uh jimmy rig it to get it to turn back on so the power comes back up it does burn one energy uh or one charge sure each round that you're you're doing it but it comes back on okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** I got one of these extra batteries.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** Should I just chuck it over to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Yeah.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** We'll use that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:28]** So Chuck is going to try to get in to the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Sweet.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** So give me a computer check.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** And does anybody want to aid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** If one could, one would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Ooh.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** No aids?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** I can't.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** I can aid.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** Hold on.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** Get your ass over here to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** To me.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** Perhaps you can aid.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Sorry.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Hold on a second.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:52]** Most of my skills are in analog communication and drawing.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** I aid as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** So 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Great.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:03]** So you can download what little information remains on this console to your data pad.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** While it's downloading, you see that most of the console's data is corrupted.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:19]** But you can see names of the missing servers, names like Avalon, Castorvon, Absalon, etc.,

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:23]** These servers are gone and cannot be accessed.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:36]** Instead, you do find a message in the council's only data pad that reads, To Dr. Vari8, please transfer your experiment results to the servers at the earliest convenience.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:41]** They are not doing anyone any good sitting on your personal computer.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** Thank you, Dr. Swinney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:44 - 00:25:03]** dr swinney uh does dr swinney's uh email signature have a headshot no it does not it's got an animated gif of them waving right his holographic image pops up exactly what they look like no it is it just says dr swinney

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Interesting.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Okay.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:15]** So can we... Chuck wants to poke around this server farm to see if anything is clearly labeled for the missing servers.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** Like to see if they're here and disconnected or if they've been like torn out and removed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** No, it's just corrupted.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Like you would recognize that...

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** There's files there, but all the files are broken.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** If you click them, there's nothing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Cool.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:36]** This personal computer, though, of some note, right?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** That's right.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** Somebody's personal machine maybe we should be on the lookout for.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** Let's just take... Does anybody want to roll...

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:48]** I don't know, give me just a general knowledge role of something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Like a culture or physical engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** Like a memory?

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** Or physical science?

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Give me your memory role.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** Or check your notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Is that wisdom?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Yeah, is that wisdom or intelligence?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:06]** I'm just going to say it said to Dr. Vari8.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Yes.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** Yeah.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** We understood that.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Vari13 or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Right.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** So it is the personal computer of Vari8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** So we're looking for Vari8's personal machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Potentially.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:24]** This is like several generations of Vari13 ago then, right?

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** We're talking about.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** I think you're onto something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Yes.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** That is.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Yes.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:34]** Because this is the first time our characters are realizing this, or did Vahri... No, Vahri explained all of it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:40]** They told you that they are... Or their progenitor, is that the right term?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:49]** Their progenitor was Vahri VIII, and they were on board this vessel when it went down, and they were researching some kind of...

**[00:26:49 - 00:27:16]** uh drift batteries the way that vari 13 described it as a way to connect to the drift and use that energy directly instead of having to nice fly like right now drift like as of right now drift it can the drift drives get you in and out of the drift and that's about it there's not any real technology that's useful besides travel right and they were trying to find something else like yeah nicola tesla they're trying to use the drift as an energy source


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** Energy source.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Cool.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** Can I text Vare13 and be like, hey, do you remember where you put your computer?

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** Go ahead.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Try it.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** That's what I do.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Do I have service?

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** I'm assuming I have service.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:33 - 00:28:03]** roll roll a T-Mobile check physical science I don't have physical science I have engineering go ahead roll it roll for bars okay yeah roll for bars I got a two perfect so you type this whole thing up and it says whatever roll is gonna say about yay we did this this and this and blah blah and you take 25 minutes to write it up and you hit I don't take that long to write it up yep yep you slang bro you have four hands but you're using a single finger from each hand Vary you up yo

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:12]** um and and you hit send and it just gives you like the like whole like the delay message or whatever the and you realize you have zero bars


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** I think this fits because I don't even have the computer skills, so I just didn't even think to look if it was service or not.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Yeah.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Works out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:26]** I think if you try maybe at the end of the hallway and stand on a rock or something, you might be able to get some service.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Yeah, that's probably true.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Let's just keep going.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** I'm sure we'll find it.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** We'll tell them when we get back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Did you find everything you needed there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** I found a little bit more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Wow.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Hey, guys.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** Can you see me through this window over here?

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** That way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Yes, Jermaine.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Hey, Jermaine.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** What are you doing in that window?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:52]** I was just thinking there's something behind this room.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** I peeked over here.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** There's another doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:02]** That was the door where I feel that ghost-like thing went into or around previously.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** But it looks locked, right?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** The red lights and so on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** Check the edges around the corner to follow the group.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:16]** Rolo takes too long to tell you that he's going to walk around and outside of the room to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:35]** rolo's actually at the window watching you guys like trying to peek around get his head flat i'll join you when i can let me get out of here what are you guys doing out there so you guys get to the door cool and give me a strength check i'll help with that um i'll help with that ah

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Ah, 21.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Beautiful.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** So you're able to crank the door almost like off the hinge.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:48]** And you actually just see almost like a solid stone behind it.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** And basically this room is completely collapsed.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:56]** It's like landed on a spike of just rock that pierced through this room.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** So there's nothing useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Well, nothing here.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** There's another door across the computer room.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** And I've disappeared from the map on accident.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** What?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Hathaway, where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Hathaway!

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** I've been deleted.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** Maybe he went through the window.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** Let me check.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** The spooky ethereal sort of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** How do you do this every time, bro?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** He didn't go through the window.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** I'm not sure where he is.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Hit control Z. Roll it.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** What did you do to me?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I didn't do anything.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** I thought perhaps maybe he went through the window.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** God dang it, Rollo.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** It's not helping, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** I think it's because you keep deleting your token instead of deleting your drawing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** Well, it wasn't selected, but I hit the delete button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Now you have to find your token somewhere else and try to recover it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** I don't know where it is, man.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** It's at the final boss, like map.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Copy paste.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** It's going to get like a preview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** Here we go.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Oh, wait.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** Guys, what are we going to do?

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** First we see ghosts, and then Tomei vanishes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** While we're waiting for Tomei, we should head back to the library.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** If he's anything like these other ghosts, I'm sure he'll turn up in a few seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** That's probably true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** He'll walk through somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** He's going to come back so beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** I thought I heard something.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** I feel like I'm in an ethereal plane now.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Where am I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Where did you go?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** There he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Can you see us?

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** No, I don't see anybody.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** What?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Are you serious?

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Yeah.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** Are you moving it?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Yeah, I moved it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Yeah, he's been moving it, but you need to give him light.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** Tomei, are you blind?

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** The settings aren't...

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** I can see you, but you... I see dark vision.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** I think that you're blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Thaddeus is going to lead Torme by the hand because he can see the dark.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Let's go, buddy.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Come on.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** No, you're going the wrong way.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Go to the west.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** To the right.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** I mean the east.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** There's a hallway here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Now go down.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** No.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Down.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Down.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** There you go.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Yes, yes.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Yes, there you go.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Good job, buddy.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** Can you still not see anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:54]** You're almost still...

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** It's all right.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** This affliction will pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** Okay, you're still looking fuzzy, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** What's up?

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Is that better?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** I'll show you what I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** I should have fixed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I'll just show you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Hit refresh, maybe.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** I did.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** I want to see what you see.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Oh my god, Will.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** If you delete your character one more time, you're just dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** I'm like in an ethereal plane.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** Yeah, you are.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** You appear to be in the shadow plane.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** I don't know.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** You barely adopted the darkness.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:34]** I was born in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** Alright, I'm going to refresh you.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Finally!

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Go back in the real world.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** You can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** Are you all right now?

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** You can see.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Oh, my God.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Fantastic.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** All right.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** That was a technical difficulty from Dankardus.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:52]** I mean, why on earth would you be able to delete your own token?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** I don't get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** It's very strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** You're not on Earth.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** I'm just glad that you can see again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** Let's see what's behind door number two.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Rules don't apply here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** What kind of Monty Hall of Horror is this?

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Let's get on with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:11]** What would you recommend I do, GM, to avoid a trap on the board?

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** Perception or engineering?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** I'll assist.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** Over the PA speakers you hear, perception.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Perception.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** I suggest perception if you're trying to avoid traps.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** 17.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** I assist you, right?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Did everyone assist?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** It's only a 14, sadly.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Check assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Dang, with that stacked up, what?

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** 14 plus 6, so 20?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** No, 8 plus 6, 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Oh, total of 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:56]** And your vision is so bad, but you can still read Braille, and so you can feel that it says study.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** We already established this as study.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** You didn't see that, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Now you feel it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** I'm just going to open this stupid door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** All right, Torme.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** All right.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Torme opens it, or tries to.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** Okay, give me a second.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Polygon reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** Polygon reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** I'll try not to delete my token this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:19]** They actually added doors to Roll20, but I didn't bother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** It's fancy.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** What do you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** It's pretty big.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Okay.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:31]** So you open up that door and you see two rows of metal tables occupy this room, all bolted to the floor.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:37]** Though emergency lights flicker overhead, the lamps attached to each table remain dark.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:45]** A haphazard pile of moldering plastic chairs rests in the southeast corner of

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** And there are several vid screens hanging on the wall.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** Some are correct.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:56]** Others are blinking occasionally on and off to show a serene outdoor panorama, kind of.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** The east corners of the room hold a pair of conference, like small conference rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** And you said that the chairs were smoldering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Moldering.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** And it actually is a term.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I had to Google that one.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** What does it mean, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Teach us a word this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** Slowly decay or disintegrate.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** So smoldering involves fire.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** Moldering is just time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:42]** what do you see to me uh see this decrepit study it's all uh looks like there's some conference rooms in the back and uh i don't know do i see anything as far as like reading materials or study materials i rolled a natural 20


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Nice.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:55]** So, yes, you can see that there are scientific journals and bound textbooks kind of on random desks here.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:00]** There are also a couple of broken electronic devices like Kindle, iPad, kind of.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** And then up ahead on the floor, you see a statue.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** Okay.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Right about here-ish.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** You see that little thing there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:34]** yeah it's like a like a like a one that you would see on a like a desk or something like a bust or what what are we talking about i think you'd have to get a little closer to find out okay i think there's something here there's a lot of books i don't really have time to read them but i'll join us all right give me a give me an engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Okay.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Check, follow, submit to the room.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Yeah.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Where's that bust so I can walk to it?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** It's the central walkway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:48]** I got a 16 on my engineering, and I'm going to be walking towards the bust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** All right, so you recognize that this area is meant for studying and meditation.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** You can note that the walls are nearly soundproofed.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** John can probably tell you a lot more about that than I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** Soundproofed or, like, isolated or proofed?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Let's talk about this later.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:26]** sound proof sound isolation sound dampening so now termay has walked kind of down the corridor and he's over where that the broken desks are in the pile in the corner we have uh rolu in the kind of middle of the room with chalk and then termay finally or thaddeus finally stepped into the room uh termay if you want to take pick up that statue


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Yeah, I'll pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:34]** You can see that it is a little statuette of three robotic figurines.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Is somebody giving me a culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Is this a triune?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** I got a 16 on my culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** All right.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:53]** It is not Triune, but it is actually Epic, Cassandale, Cass, man, I knew, I practiced this like 80 times, too.

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:00]** Cassandale and Bri, and they are the three deities that combine to become Triune.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Uh,

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** So I think this is a good time for Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:19]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** All right, take it away.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Gather round, everyone.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** I got your hot chocolate.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Gather round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** Do you guys know about triune?

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Some marshmallows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** Picture Treme actually sitting in front of... Little children, come gather to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** Come gather and listen and hear that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:43]** The Caduceus actually sponsors a local school somewhere around that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** This isn't court appointed, I promise.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** I just do this out of the goodness of my heart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:51]** He adjusts the leg cuff on his pants to hide his ankle bracelet.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** His tracking anklet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:09]** I want to tell you about Abalon and for centuries it sought to construct, maintain a vast city-sized neural network called Epoch.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** One of these figures here.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:39]** for a single purpose which was the creation of a god for robotic uh machines and such those machines they they succeeded but not in what they intended upon achieving godhood epoch reached out into the ether searching for an ascended artificial intelligences like himself like itself sorry

**[00:39:40 - 00:40:02]** and found two of them metaphorically right next door, a living construct called Bri that had become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness of an alien android named Cassandali, who achieved divinity as an iron god on Pregap Glorian.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:24]** At speeds incomprehensible, even to other deities, the three open themselves to one another, pouring through one another's processes and finding not just camaraderie, but the opportunity for all of them to be so much more.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:35]** In an eye blink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite deity far greater than the sum of its parts, the new god Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Wow, that was one of your best yet.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** That was great.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Thanks so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:49]** I was quoted from something called a core rule book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** He's real.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Reading the car roll book to the kids.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** Do you frequently do this at local libraries and bookstores?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** Yes, every other Sunday from 4 to 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Just before bedtime.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** This is good material for you.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** The outreach credit that we need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** It's free, Captain.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Thank you, gentlemen.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** I think it's lunchtime for the kids.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** We have to get them out of here, so thank you guys for coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:29]** If you'd like to learn more about Triune, follow Paizo and go to visit your local library.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** The god of all gods is Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** The highest god is Paizo.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:40]** Also, if you need any protection from anybody, you know, Jocelyn, your library or something, then just let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:51]** I get some real Metropolis, like 1927 film vibes from the three of these figurines.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Yeah.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Cool.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Well, with that...

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** Will, go ahead and roll me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Oh, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** God dang it.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:08]** Okay, if you actually get a message from Triune, I'm going to be so upset.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:13]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Okay, I failed.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Or I got a 10.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** I got a 10.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Oh, that's a fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** You are now confused for two rounds.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** Go ahead and roll me a D100.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** Why are you confused?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** We're in combat though, right?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:53]** don't ask what's going on here again i'm so confused depending on this role you might be in combat you just read uh you 68 so close deal 1d8 plus your strength modifier to yourself what with the statue that you just picked up what the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** What are you doing?

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:00]** Okay, so I didn't roll too bad.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** I got a three.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** And I don't have a strength modifier, so three points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** All right, so you take three points of damage.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Stop.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** Take it from him.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:13]** This statue is possessed by, I'm sure.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Pick it out of his arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:34]** i slap it out of his hands triune's not okay so don't touch it don't touch it don't touch it so rolu and thaddeus just stepped up to try to stop termay from hurting himself but yeah just knock it out of his hands yeah yeah chuck is just shook as you approach him

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** I need both of you to roll will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Oh, fuck.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Damn it.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** All right.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** This is not the time to shout will save.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** 14.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** 18.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Will save!

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Yeah, of course, Kev shouts it.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** You said 14 and 18?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Yeah.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** So neither one of you actually feel the effects.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** To me, drop it.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Wait, is it coming from that statue or something?

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** I almost lost my own... Oh, to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** I thought for a second I felt something.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Guys, what's going on up there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:12]** Alright, I try and kick it into the corner of the room.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Don't approach.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** I'm sure, right?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:21]** Do I kick it into the corner of the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** You kicked it out of his hand?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** It's in his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** I already said that I walked up and I've said like three times that I've walked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Well, we'd have to look up disarm rules.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** There was a lot going on there.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Starfinder disarmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:39]** Do you want to go by disarm rules or do you want to do another mechanic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** There is a disarm.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** That's the best way to take something out of somebody's hand.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:48]** A character with improved combat can gain a plus four.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** That's not what I'm looking for.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Disarm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** I didn't drop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:52]** All right.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** No, because you struck yourself with it.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** So it's still in your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** I'm going to throw it against the ground if I can now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** You're still confused for one more round.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:07]** So before anybody does anything else, Rolu, you said you wanted to do a disarm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Start the timer.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Two minutes on the clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Oh, yeah, right.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** That's my job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Jeez, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Sorry, my watch is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Oh, it's not a skill.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** It's a tactical rules, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** And start at two minutes on the clock.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** We're looking at how to disarm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** There's a mechanic for it, right?

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Period.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Line of sight.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** It's definitely like combat maneuvers.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** These are conditions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Yeah, it's disarm.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** It's a combat maneuver.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** KC plus eight.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Try it.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Okay, one sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** So final ruling, you roll against his KC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Yep.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** Do you have a weapon with the disarm property?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** I do not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** What weapons have a disarm property?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** I got a 14, which probably does not beat his KC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Probably not.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:54]** So you try, you reach for it with all three out of the four arms, and you miss.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** He's just like, no, this is mine.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So go ahead and roll another D100, Will.

**[00:45:59 - 00:45:59]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Gosh, for real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** This is the last time.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** This is round two.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** 37.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** 37.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:12]** Okay, so you stand there and do nothing but babble incoherently for six seconds.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:19]** 1,001, 1,002, 1,003, 1,004, 1,005, 1,006.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** Okay, he shakes his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:43]** what just happened you were telling a dope as f story and then your eyes rolled back into your head and uh you know you lost your mind that statue was cursed i told you this place is creepy so as you guys go with it right now yeah i dropped that shit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:48]** And as you guys are arguing over this and finally get her to drop the statue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** I'm going to not drop it in, by the way.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** I just want to be clear.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** I'm dropping it like in this corner over here so we don't have to be near this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** So you're throwing it is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** No, just like right here.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Just dropping it next to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** The Torme doesn't like to break relics, you know?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** He just wants to set it down.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Let me hear it.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** It might be profitable later.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** We could sell it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** I don't know.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** See, that is the Torme that I know.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** That's the one that hits himself.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** I was hitting myself?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** Yes, you hit yourself with a statue.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Gosh, that's why I got a headache.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Yeah, and then you spoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:23]** I think the light of understanding passes over Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** He's like, guys, guys.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Do you think that's what happened to the crew?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:35]** And as you say that, you hear shifting.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Something.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** In one of those two rooms to the east.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:45]** But their doors are kind of next to each other, so it just kind of sounds like it's coming from the same area.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** So I can't tell you which room it's in.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Unless you get real close.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Do you hear that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** One of those rooms over there.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** Something's in there.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Hmm.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Sounds like something you should check out, Roloo.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:58]** I agree.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** It's very easy to be the leader.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:10]** And Roloo steps ten feet forward, standing not in the threshold of either door, but right before it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:23]** So Chuck skitters, like, across all of the desks on the wall farthest from this totem and climbs up onto Rolu's shoulder, but is, like, holding onto Rolu's face.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Like, Chuck is scared.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** This is some s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** Chuck, this is intense, but we are ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** Rolu's going to peek in both rooms.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:39]** Yeah, can we perceive at this range, like, what direction it was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:46]** So Rolo is now, you're standing, there's one square, and in that square there's a door to the south and a door to the north.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** And you're standing just to the left, like the square to the left of it.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** So you're able to kind of peek in to each door.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** And you don't see anything in the left side, kind of to the north.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** But when you go to peek to the right, you find there's a small table there.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** And there's somebody sitting at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:11]** Does this somebody look ethereal or is this like a whole person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Yeah.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Do I need to perceive?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** Do I have any, or is it just a, do I see the outline of a figure?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Cause I, I have the worst vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Right.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:23]** And I don't think like at the angle that you're at, you don't have enough to see.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** You see that there's somebody there.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** There's some, there's a figure you see just like a sleeve.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** I think I'm going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** So.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** All right.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:39]** Two of Rollu's hands are beckoning to Thaddeus and Torme saying, like, come, come.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** And Rollu's going to step into the square between the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** So you know how I roll wisdom checks to see what Chalk is going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Oh, my God.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** That was the best noise you could have ever made, Kev.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** So that was a two on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** Yeah.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:06]** For a total of two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** So Choc is going to climb down from your shoulder, walk right up to the individual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** I don't think you even climb down.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** You just straight jump onto the table and you're like, hey!

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** There's some weird stuff going on around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Hey, how's it going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:33]** So Rolu stepped up at the same time, and he sees it, but you see it too, that there is a Lashunta Demaya in a lab coat sitting at this table.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:40]** Her hair is dark red, and you can see just a little bit of olive skin past her hair.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** And sitting across from her is a human man with long black hair.

**[00:50:46 - 00:51:08]** hey i've seen you two roaming around and i was gonna ask for a perception check but yep chalk is on the table and i'm gonna i want to move you chalk sure to where you're actually at uh oh oh from oh man there's a i i got it

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Okay, cool.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** There's a little table there.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** I want you to sit on top of that table.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** And when you're sitting there, you jump in the middle and you look back and forth.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** And you get a much better look.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:23]** And you realize their faces are actually decayed away.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** It's almost just bone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:29]** And they are nothing more than just skeletons.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:37]** And as you jumped on that table, it shifted just enough that the Lashunta falls over.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:49]** And as her body hits the ground, a semi-transparent form seemingly grows from her.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** And stands up.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** And I need you all to roll for initiative.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** No!

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:00]** You know, I really try to keep my language clean in this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** Fiddlesticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:11]** This setup couldn't have been any better.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:15]** Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Oh, shock.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Oh, shock.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** It's been a minute since we've had combat, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** Hey, you guys remember that time that Chuck just dove into the middle of two whites?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** That was a good time.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Oh, yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** So bad.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** Let me see.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** I think I did.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** Ah, I didn't.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** Okay, here, I do have this one, so let me show you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** This is what she looks like.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** Oh, God!

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** Wow, she looks way worse as a skeleton.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:55]** So she's a Lashunta, so her antennae are still there, but her jaw, the skin around her teeth have just decayed completely.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** Her teeth look like a wicked smile.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:01]** Her eyes are just these big, bug-red eyes.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** She has long nails.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** I was going to say, she looks like she just got her nails did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** She got her nails did.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Nails have been growing for a long time.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** They look like pink daggers.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Right.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** She looks like she's from the Fallout series.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** For sure.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** She's like a ghoul, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Yeah.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** I don't like it.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Cool.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** It's going to haunt me for a long time.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:27]** Yeah, this is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** It'll haunt you if it doesn't kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Drift dead is what it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** Okay, what are your guys'... He'll float too.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Oh, no, Kevin.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Or maybe I was just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** What's your initiative rolls?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Seven for Chuck.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Seven for Chuck?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** He's absolutely shook at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** TPK, coming your way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** It was good while it lasted, old friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** I got a 14.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** It was good while it lasted.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** 14 for Tremere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Great show while it lasted.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** 18 for Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** 18 for Rolo.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** And Thaddeus, what do you got?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Thaddeus is 9.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** 9.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** 9.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** And you never did take that 10-minute rest, did you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** Nope.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Oh, no.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Why?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Why?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:23]** I, like, from a metagame perspective, I expected the big battle to come after the double door.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** So, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** Well, it is the LaShunta's turn.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:30]** No.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** And they are flanking you.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** So let me roll that dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** I'm just going to go ahead and look up the dying rolls while you do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:46]** It's a 21 plus 2 for 23 to hit.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** Does a 23 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Jeez.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Come on.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** You took that healing serum though, didn't you?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:56]** I'm not going to answer that question because I'm going to say mean things to you if I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** Well, just go ahead and write it down.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** You take five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** That thing just took a swipe at a truck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Cool.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** It's the end of this creature's turn.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** It is now Roller's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:15]** I think Rolu can't actually see the other long hair, per se.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** Maybe just saw briefly.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:26]** And I think the first thing that Rolu thinks of is that Chak needs to get out of there, and we need to draw them out.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:39]** So Rolu's one of his hands reaches out and he tries to feel like he can imagine in his head what has happened in this Lashunta's 300 plus years of existence.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:45]** And his hand reaches out and he conjures this moment of serenity and peace and...

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:51]** And tries to just plant it in with the serene image that is seen on the video displays in the room behind him.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** And he tries to put the Lashunta in that space.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** And then his fingers snap.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** And he is going to cast Dream of Home.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** And that Lashunta needs to make a...

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** A will save.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Will save.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** Do it.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Make the will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** DC 14.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** DC 14.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:16]** Let me just double check to make sure that... Is this a... It's not a force, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:19]** I think... No, it's a mind affecting enchantment.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** No, it's a mind effect.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** Unless they're immune, at which point... There's a lot of immunities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** I just want to make sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Oh, they might be undead immunities.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** At that point, I'm an idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** Does it not work on... No.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** It's already done.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** I don't see anything that says... It's a will save, and it's... What is it?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** It's a mind-affecting enchantment.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Does it not work on undead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** I do see undead are immune to the following effects.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** Unless the effect specifies it works against undead creatures...

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** This is mind affecting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Yep.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** There it is.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** I see it finally.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Cause I'm a slow reader.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Uh, so mind affecting does not work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** Um, so I'll, I'll give that to you as a free action.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Cause that's not, well, no, is it?

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** I don't know.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** That's entirely your call.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:10]** Roll, roll, roll me, uh, uh, D 100 and I'll give you 50, 50 chances that wasted your spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Over or under?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** You pick.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Okay, if I get over.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** Yeah, so if I get over, then... Is it my favorite?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:20]** I got a... Oh, nope, I got a 26.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:20]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:26]** So you do this, and you try to bring them in, but you get no sense back.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Yeah, they're doing anything.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** There's nothing in their head.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:32]** They are just a creature of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Okay.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** Then I still have a move action that was a standard action, and it'll completely waste its spell.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** Is there space that I can see for me to step into the room?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** The room that they're in?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Yeah, or is it already full up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** No, you can step into the room with them.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** Okay, Bro's going to step into the room with them.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** That's foolish, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** I'm trying to save shock.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Are you going to carry?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** No, I'm just trying to maybe divert.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** Rulu's thinking he needs to move in and do something.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** Maybe use that portal in there.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** Good idea.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** Okay, I'm just trying to put these on actual squares.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:08]** I had them set up so you guys couldn't just see them when you walk in the room, but that's where they're actually standing.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** Okay, so...

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:17]** Just for the listener, there's a tiny room that is about, what, 15 feet by 10 feet.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:27]** And there are now two of these specter-like creatures standing over the dead bodies of presumably who they were before.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:32]** And then there's Rolu and Chak all up in the mix of that.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** And it is now the second creature's turn.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:41]** And that second creature is going to strike at Chuck.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Oh, dang.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** I was hoping that wouldn't happen.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** With a full attack.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Oh, my God.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:48]** And I need to make sure I have the right dice in my hand.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** So it's a minus four.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** But it's also still flanking.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** So it's a minus two.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** And that's a 19 on the die.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Chuck, you're going to take...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Nine points of damage.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** And he immediately falls unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** Ah, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Question.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:18]** If I'm doing a full round of attack and I do two attacks, can I just turn and attack John now since you're dead?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Right?

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** I don't see why not.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Can you attack two creatures?

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** I mean, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** I'm going to assume so.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** I think I missed though.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** That is, I got to do like, okay.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** So it's a minus four.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** It's okay.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** That is nine, a nine to hit does not hit, right?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** No.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:46]** So this, this second creature, the one with the long black hair, and I'll pull up an image for you.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:57]** Uh, it goes to swipe at you and it strikes down chalk and then it swings at Rolo, but Mrs.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:04]** Oh, Kev, you son of a... Oh, shock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** All right.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** You better live through this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:10]** Currently exploring options to evac you out of there immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** We don't want to carry his dead body out.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** I think you guys should go use your portal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** That's what I'm trying to look at.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** Trying to look at what I can do to plane or fade out of there.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:23]** But we need to see if they can... Or seal the door.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Listen, man.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Let's seal the door.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** But can they go through it?

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** We need to know.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** It's okay to make the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** They probably can't.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** They probably can go through the door, I'm sure.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** They probably can.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Well, actually.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** Based on Kevin's face, they probably can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Yeah.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** They can too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
