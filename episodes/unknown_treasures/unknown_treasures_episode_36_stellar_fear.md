**[00:00:01 - 00:00:12]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:16]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:23]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:56 - 00:01:00]** Welcome back to We'll Save in the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:06]** I am Kevin, your GM for Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:06]** Yeah!

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:08]** Treasures unknown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:17]** Uh, so fun fact, uh, I, I was going back to look up the room cause I've, I love watching that movie so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:19]** How often do you watch that movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:20]** All the time.

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:28]** And I was actually really impressed cause when I, I Googled it and there is a showing tonight at 1150, uh, in my head, like the local theater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** I was like, you should do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** You should do it.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** I'll be honest.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:34]** I've, I've never seen the room or, um,

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** What's the other one?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** Disaster... The Disaster Artist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** The Disaster Artist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** The movie about the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** You have to see the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** I have no context for this conversation.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** What?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Zero context?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Do you know what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Can somebody explain?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** John, I guess you probably know the most.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** Explain Tommy Wiseau to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** Well, I think Kelly knows the most.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Why would Kelly know the most?

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:01]** I might know the most about Tommy, but like... Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** John might have seen my post, but I actually met him like a couple days ago.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** All right, well, we should explain, especially for Vinny, because he's here.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** He's not anyone who hasn't seen it.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** So wild.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:17]** So basically, The Room is a passion project made by a guy who looks like a vampire of questionable European descent.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** No one knows where he's from, and no one knows where he got his money.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** But he made a movie called The Room that he starred in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** Wait, wait, before we go any further...

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** I was reading his Wikipedia.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** He also has never admitted when he was born.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** He's basically Will.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** Yes.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** He's Will.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** He's Will.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** He's another highlighter.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** It's like Will has to kill him.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** But I feel like Will would actually be good at acting and writing a movie.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:44]** But the thing is Tommy Wiseau is not this way.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:51]** So basically, it is widely accepted to be the worst movie ever in the funniest way.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** So you really, really have to see it.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** In some way, that makes it the greatest, though, is what is contended.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:00]** It is legendarily bad and good.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** So I was at Comic-Con LA last weekend.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Jealous.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** And then, like, I went with, like, my sister and some friends and stuff.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** And, like, there were, like, Marvel people there.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** And I didn't give a shit.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:18]** But then, like, out of the corner of my eye, like, I saw, like, the table, the booth for the room.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** And I saw all this Tommy Wiseau merchandise there.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** And I was like, oh, my God.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** And I grabbed my sister.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** And I was like, check this out.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** And then I was looking down, awestruck at all the room merchandise.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** And I was like, Natalie, you don't understand.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** My sister's name is Natalie.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:37]** This is the worst movie ever.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** You have to watch it.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** And then I didn't realize until I said that.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** And I went on and on about how terrible it was.

**[00:03:43 - 00:04:01]** So there was a shadow over me, you know, there's like a shadow over you but you don't realize You know, it's crazy about this Tommy just emerges from his own shadow.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** So

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** Yeah, so the shadow, I know, it was like a double shadow.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** It was so weird.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** It was better than the whole movie.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:10]** And then I realized that someone was above me.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** And then I just looked up and I saw his face turn away.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:19]** And he always wears sunglasses, man, no matter where and when.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** And he had them on.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:26]** Anyway, he looks like a freaking death metal guy from Scandinavia.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Yes.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:30]** But anyway, so he like, he turned away and then my sister also saw it too.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** And she told me like, oh my God, that was him.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** He turned away.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** I felt so bad.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** He wiped a tear.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Especially since he's...

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** I know he was such a good guy, too.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:43]** So then I was wearing this jacket, and immediately I turned the corner, and I was like, okay, but I need to get a picture with him.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** But after I insulted him, I don't know how I could do this.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** So you just stood there, like, gave my jacket.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** He's been on this movie for 10 minutes.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** For like a while.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** He hears you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]** And then you want to get his autograph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Yes, because I love him.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** He's like, exactly.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** He's like Nicolas Cage.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** He's like one of those people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** I love Nicolas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** He's like William Chung.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** The Bs, not the Bs.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** William Chung.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:12]** Did you guys see the latest movie of his?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Big Shark.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** No, the one where it's about... It's the same right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:39]** sidetracked by nicholas cage so okay so there's some movies that nicholas cage is super good and for some reason that just perfect for him so it's probably great but anyway so then like so then i was like oh well i can't like he i don't want him to know who i am so i gave my sister my jacket i put on like a beanie that i got from somewhere and then like i adopted a british accent and i went back to him and i was like and then like then like i got this like photo

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** that they were selling.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** And I was like, can I please get a picture with Tommy if I do this?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** But he was so nice.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** He like brofisted me.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** And then he's like, you know what, man?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Get the fresh photo.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Because they were like pre-written.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Like on there.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** And he's like, get the new one.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** And then instead of in black pen, he wrote it in brilliant red.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** And he's like, what do you want to say?

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** And then I was like, just anything you want.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** I don't care, Tommy.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Just do it.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** And then like, but just write it to Kelly.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** And then he thought about it.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** for way too long because it's the motto of the Rue movie.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** And he's like, love is blind.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** And then he like wrote that on there.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** And then he wrote like an extra heart for Kelly because I think he thought that was my girlfriend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** Like, you know, because of my name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I took some photos of him.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** But this was all in a British accent.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** This is all in a British accent.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** A very terrible one.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** But I framed it and it's on the top shelf.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** His accent is not real.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** It can't be real.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** No one knows if he's self-aware about how bad it is or not.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** I think he's not.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** Yeah, that's why he's so upset because he heard you say how bad it is.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** He looked really crushed.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** And he's like, but it's the greatest film ever.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** I felt so sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** But he has to be aware of how...

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** It's close as anyone can be.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:54]** How much panning this movie has led to the success of this movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** Yeah.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** I think that's kind of the problem, though.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:04]** He has so much success from the film because of how bad it was that he thinks it's actual success.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:11]** So I would say this is the same thing that we talk about in our business meetings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:14]** How do you measure success?

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** And we think we're amazing and everybody else hates us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Right.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** The podcast is so terrible that people can't stop listening to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** Basically, this is prisoners of the ghost land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Yeah.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Oh my God.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** Are you saying that we're not self-aware about how bad we are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:31]** It's two and a half books deep of just like car accident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:38]** Everyone on Discord is in on it, but they're too polite to tell us.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Separate secret Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:44]** They download it every Wednesday morning just to hear how bad it is.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Are we the room of podcasts?

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** I think we are.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** That's fine, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** It'll make us rich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** We're going to start talking with funny accents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** We'll open up our own booth.

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:02]** We already do that because Kelly impersonated a British accent to talk to Tommy Wiseau.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:12]** I did know that Kelly saw Tommy Wiseau, but I did not know the massive story behind the... I just saw the one image of him with the signature.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:21]** The other thing is Nicolas Cage's new movie is called The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and it's a self-aware mockumentary.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** I also haven't seen the Weird Al movie.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** Dude, it's so good.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:31]** Weird Al is so freaking good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** What is good?

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** I think it's just called Weird.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** It's the Weird Al movie.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:59]** starring oh yeah really and that is like an exaggerated ridiculous like i've been a weird fan forever me too and like i expected it to be a fairly faithful retelling of his story it's it's word for word reality dude it is the most weird owl movie you could possibly imagine more than uhf

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:06]** whatever it was it was UHF yeah it is the most Weird Al movie you could ever imagine amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Okay.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I gotta watch it.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** That is all that I will say.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Yeah, I gotta watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:18]** I saw the trailer for it and it was like he was doing cocaine off of Madonna and that's how they came up with like a surgeon.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** And I was like, I'm pretty sure Weird Al is like the most Christian Christian.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** Like, that is fact.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** He's like the most wholesome human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** That's probably one of the more accurate parts of the movie.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** I was getting mixed up with Carrot Top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** No, Carrot Top.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** No, Carrot Top actually did cocaine off of Madonna.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Probably really unchristian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** I did see...

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:45]** weird out one time because i think he lives in echo park or in silver lake oh yeah i'm sure really yeah and yeah he probably walks his dogs every day it's like probably next door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** He's probably, yeah, he's probably right around the corner.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Well, if you get a signature with him, make sure you tell him how great he is.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** And I want it.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** I want a signature from him.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:57]** I'll buy the signature off your skin when he signs your chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** Okay.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Oh, Weird Al?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** Why don't we just have him sign a piece of paper and have it tattooed on you, Kev?

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** On your butt, next to your cock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** You need to open your shirt and have a piece of paper on your chest and let him sign that.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Just kidding, that's for Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:18]** And then we can just superglue the paper to your shirt, to your chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** We can definitely permade it for Kevin.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** Kevin is not discriminating about his tattoos, I should say.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:28]** They're all kinds of interesting stuff all over his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:36]** If you do that, if you're able to get Weird Al to sign your chest with a piece of paper, I will then get it tattooed on my chest.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** And have him sign over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** No matter what it says on there.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I feel like we should approach Weird Al to just do the tattoo himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Yeah.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** That's true.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** Design it himself.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** Oh, my God.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I would let Weird Al tattoo me.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I'm in.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** Weird Al, if you're listening, I would let you tattoo me.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Patreon goal.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Patreon goal.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Patreon goal.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Tommy, you can tattoo me.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** And also, I'm sorry again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** Kelly, you do have a thing for insulting celebrities at conventions.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** You're two for two.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Hang on, this is so hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Matthew Wheeler?

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** Yeah.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** That guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** What happened?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** No, why would you say that?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** He wouldn't leave me alone.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** He's such a nice guy, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** Dude, he's so awesome.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** I mean, you should check out Beetle and Grimms.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:18]** He owns Beetle and Grimms and does super quality, cool work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** He just couldn't accept that I've never seen Scream and I only knew him as Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** You only knew him as Shaggy.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** He was just sad about it.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** SLC Punks.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** I saw him in Hackers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** He's been in so much and he was so nice standing in front and he was like talking to everybody.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** He was like, hey, do you want this?

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Do you want to get this?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** He was so friendly and Kelly was just like, I don't know who this guy is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** You know, and he's like,

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** Blissfully unaware he's pretty good and without a paddle without a paddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Oh, I saw him in that.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Yeah, Matthew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:47 - 00:12:01]** That's another movie Yeah, he is now we gave him somebody no wonder he will be that famous but until we are I think we got to stick to what we know the best and that's playing our finder.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:05]** Oh Let's play what a transition


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** What a trans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Was that good?

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** I tried.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** I was working it in and I was like, oh, that was pretty good.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** That was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Take it away, Kev.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** I'd put it in the top 50 percentile of your transitions.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Yeah.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Yeah.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Oh, it was out of turn.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Yeah, it was all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:21]** Not like top 10, but like top 25.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** I prefer your like.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:25]** I had something to tie it in and I totally forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** I am curious now.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** Tell me, what was my best transition?

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** I want to know.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** I'm very curious.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** It's episode seven.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:40]** Okay, so last time, you all gathered at the... What was that?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Nothing.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:50]** You just like waved like, you know, like some kind of like a mom in an Eddie Murphy movie or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** And what's weird is that your video lagged.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:59]** So for all we know, the real Kevin could have been pulled out of his seat and now you're fake Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** Anyways, last time, you were all gathered at the entrance of the Great Wreckage.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:08]** You tried to convince Fari 13 to come in with you, but I had to shoot that down.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:18]** And speaking of shooting down, you went into the airlock, you got the inner door open, and beyond that door, there was an archway with a podium behind some glass.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:41]** chalk knew that this was some kind of trap or what some people would call a security system uh chalk climbed over the glass and tried to hack into the computer but got frustrated and shot it instead uh that set off the auto turret that was hidden in the ceiling it came down open fire on every moving thing in sight including the poor goblin peeking through the exterior door i keep

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:45]** and then hit each of you for some heavy damage, except Rolloo.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:48]** Rolloo was actually able to duck out of the way at the last second.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:57]** Then you all ran for cover and waited for the turret to run down, and then while it was recharging, you passed through that scanner and disabled the turret.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:08]** Once inside, you took inventory of your surroundings and you noted a distinct metal-on-metal sound coming from up the corridors up to the front and to the left of you.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Clink, clink.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Clink, clink.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Let me take you back to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Oh, fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:20]** Also, if you see me on my phone, it's because I have Hero Lab on it, so don't judge, okay?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Judgments.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** All judgments.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** It's not working on my PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** Hero Lab, if you're listening, reach out.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Yeah, Hero Lab.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** No, it's not your fault, Hero Lab.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** I don't know, man.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** It's my fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** The software engineer is complaining about Hero Lab not working on his computer.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** I love it, so just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** So we bring you back to the map.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** One thing I do need to note is I did not say this last time.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:49]** There are, in fact, two dead Akestis, two deceased Akesti Technomancers laying on the ground right within that first corridor.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** So it's possible that corridor was telling the truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** Oh, can we add one more update to the previous?

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** We realized how much of a traitor Rolly was.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:04]** I know that that was maybe two episodes ago, but I feel like I want to emphasize he's a big traitor.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Define this for us.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Why was he a traitor?

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** I'm curious.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** I don't know.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:13]** Obviously, we found out Shaq and Torme was... God damn it, Torme.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** It's too sleepy to help.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** What?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** What are you talking about?

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** I don't know what you're saying.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Shaq, he was less Torme.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** So then he went to Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:26]** So is this conversation happening in the hallway of this dark... All right, all right, fine, here we go.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** I'm curious, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** Hey, Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** Rolu's standing five feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** I mean, we already kind of like... Yeah?

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** What's up, what's up, webs?

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Rolu, turn away.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Don't, don't, don't.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** This is a private conversation.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** This is not a very big corridor.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** I can't turn away.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** I mean, like, yeah.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** I'm just going to ignore you, so just ignore us, all right?

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** We'll make it mutual.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Listen, Shaq, that was pretty amazing, wasn't it?

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** I mean, I know we never really talked about it, but...

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Good lord.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** What's your thoughts on this?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** I mean... Okay, for real, Roly, you can't be listening.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** Let's just pretend that, like... But I'm standing right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** I don't know.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** I'm fucking up this roleplay moment so hard.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I mean, I'll walk away.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** All right.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Just walking towards the sound.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** This is what Thaddeus does.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** No, no, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:14]** The funniest part is like acoustically, we're a hallway with a bunch of hard parallel surfaces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:17]** Yeah, the RT in here is like all echoing.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** Yeah, it's at least two seconds.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** I mean, is it intelligible?

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** I don't know.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** Good thing Rolo brought a sound level meter and a microphone.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** He's going to set up smart and we'll be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:29]** But I'm not sure you could hear it over the clink, clink, clink, clink.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** That's echoing through the halls either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** Yeah.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** That bot that Kevin forgot to hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** I was kidding about doing this in person.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** Wait, everybody stop moving.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** Do you want to have this conversation outside of the game real quick?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** You're talking about how much of a traitor Rolu is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Rolu's 30 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** Chuck was the one that actually acknowledged that to you, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Twice now.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** Did he?

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Oh, I'm sorry.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** I guess Thaddeus just likes to talk about how much of a traitor Rolu is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Right, but Chuck was like, oh yeah, you're right.

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** He's totally a traitor.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** We know that for sure.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** He feels vindicated.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:08]** It's been episodes and episodes of people not being sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** That much salt is bad for your heart, dude.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** I'm GMing this and I'm still not sure.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** You haven't convinced me yet.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Cool.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** So here is the situation.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** Are we done on the topic?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** You're settled?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** You're good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** Here's the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Here's the situation.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Here's the situation.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** I feel silly now.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** Does he know about the whereabouts of that wanted man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:34]** Yeah, he is a douche.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** But he's kind of cool, though, at the same time.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** I wish that I had a hat like that, I've got to say.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** He's kind of dope.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** Way cooler than Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:47]** All right, so you guys are all grouped together tightly, including Rolo.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** Get back over there.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:53]** In the cross sections of the hallway and the main entrance.

**[00:17:53 - 00:18:00]** So again, there's a hallway that goes straight ahead of you, but it's possible that it opens into a bigger room or goes off straight and just splits off.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** And that splits off into other corridors.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:07]** And then there's corridors to the left and the right of you that go about 30 feet each.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** What are you guys thinking?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** And just to note, that clinking sound was coming from... Are we out of initiative?

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** We're out of initiative.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:17]** So that clinking noise was coming from the left or the front.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** And or both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** I'm going to administer a healing serum for myself.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** Yep.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Okay.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I'm going to vote left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Man, that clinking sound is really annoying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** It is.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** It sounds like it's coming down from the left side.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** I thought I saw a shadow of something earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** Maybe.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:42]** We should probably check these Akestis and see if they've got anything valuable or something we might want to take back to their family.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:48]** Can I make a culture check to figure out if there's some sort of thing we should bring back for their burial ritual?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** To bring back to their family?

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Sure.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Let me make this up.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** It's a 16.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:10]** Yeah, you know that they like to take the skull and place it onto a grave and plant a plant inside of it so that the plant grows up out of each eye socket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Oh, man.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** That's metal.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Who's going to clean the skulls?

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Yeah.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** Jack immediately regrets the idea.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Yeah.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** Guys, we should, when we're making our exit, we should probably bring these bodies back with us.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** From what I've observed, they've got a burial ritual.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** Something about plants and eye sockets.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** It's a bit metal, but they're probably going to want these bodies returned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** You want to just toss them outside or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** Uh, yeah, that's a good idea.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** Let's do that now, and then we can keep exploring the ship so we don't forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Agreed.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** That's good.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** Give them something to do outside instead of wandering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:58]** But we still got something observing us ahead, perhaps.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:04]** We should post up in case something comes after us as we're pulling a body out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** All right, so you guys are all gathered in the middle of this intersection, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:32]** what way which what direction are you guys thinking which way are you moving how long are we worried or concerned about this uh thing that was skittering and or these things growing i'm worried about it because it's kevin and i want to avoid it wait the growing the growing thing is is a is a ritual that that the kestis do so they would take the skull after the fact and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:39]** And instead of burying the body, they would place the skull and use it as a planter, which, yes, that is canon.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** And it's in, I think, Alien Archive 7 or will be in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Which makes sense because they're like in the desert.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:50]** And so the withering plant is like a picture of their withering life form.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:02]** Perhaps we should, as we were discussing earlier, move the Kestis outside so they can bury their own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** I forgot about that.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** I know it was only two minutes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** I'll keep my eyes trained on this hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:18]** And I'm going to be trying to do perception to see if I hear anything from a specific direction.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** While this is going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Okay, so do you want to move the bodies outside?

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** Because I put them on the map, so we're going to drag one out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:34]** Yeah, I think Jack is going to step out of the door because he can't actually help move bodies and ask for whomever from the Keshti regime to retrieve these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** Daddy just kind of tosses it out, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** We found these.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** It's dark.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** Thought we might want to return them to you for last rites.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:49]** Hey, we were told about a couple of Keshtis that teleported in.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:56]** Obviously, they didn't make it, but we wanted to give you the opportunity to respect your fallen comrades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** I told you.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** I told you.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:04]** The one corridor is shouting like, I knew it was real.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:10]** And a southern Australian accent, like southeastern, like Sydney, Tasmania.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** That's the accent they have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** It's pretty specific.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** It didn't sound Australian.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** I'll try to verify that for you.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Check turns to him with fire in his eyes.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** Cordo, now is not the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:33]** What's going on in there, guys?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Are you guys okay?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:34]** You need more help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:43]** Probably best that you stay away from this entrance as we saw the compatriot who fell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** To answer your actual question, I do think we need more help.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** I don't think you can offer it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** Yeah, I'm going to have to be on that latter part there.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:57]** But, like, is that canon thing stopped?

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** We've taken care of it for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** For the time being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** There's more to explore on the inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** I don't recommend approaching.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Truly.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** Again, to my first point, just stay away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** Keep clear of the doorway.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:18]** You may want to barricade it or mark something in the sand, put something in the way so no innocent bystanders are caught in the crossfire again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:29]** So, Merc is actually going to run up and just take her finger and drag it in this big archway and be like, No, go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** No, no!

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** No, don't go that way!

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Uh-oh.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** That's exactly what I had in mind, Mark.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Caduceus, what's more into the breach?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Tally-ho.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** Ho.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:43]** All right.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:48]** Once you guys get back inside to the intersection, why don't you give me... Are you done here?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:52]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** Torme, what did you see while I do a perception check as well?

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** I got a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Natural 20!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** For a total of 18?

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Yeah, for a total of 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** I got a 22.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** I got a 9.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Clink, clink.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Clink, clink.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Clink, clink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Clink, clink.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** I hear something.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** This time it is almost entirely in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:23]** Got it.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** So check down the corridor.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:27]** Check where the 22 could localize it to straight down the corridor.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Hey guys, I think it's down this way.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** I'm going to try to sneak forward to see what I can see.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Everyone else take cover.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:44]** So Jack is going to sneak to like the corner of the next intersection and peer around to whichever side he hears the clinking from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** Okay, so as you approach that corner... Make a stealth check?

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Yes.

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:00]** But also, just describing what you're seeing, you come to that corner, the end of that corner, and that's where that area teed off.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:12]** So there's a corridor that goes to the left, another corridor that goes to the right, and then you can see that there is... It's almost like there's just a wall, a barrier, that is dividing kind of a front and aft section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:24]** And on this wall, there are, I would say like there's digital devices kind of embedded into the wall along the way, but none of it's energized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Nothing's powered.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** Displays like probes, like, like just lighting effects.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** What are we talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:35]** I would say it looks more like equipment for the ship.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:40]** Possibly readouts, power readouts, servers, whatever the case may be.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:45]** Something related to keeping the ship operational.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:50]** And just to note, the part of the ship that you're on is definitely not the entirety of the ship.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** You found...

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:00]** You know, the control council for the bridge.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:04]** You found another section over near where the escape pods were.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Like this ship has been decimated.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:10]** This is pretty much just the lab area of the Stellar Flight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:14]** Thank you for connecting those thoughts because I didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Yep.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Let me draw those lines in there for you.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Cool.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Thank you, GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Much appreciated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Um, and so you rolled your stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** What was your stealth?

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** 27.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** 24.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** Uh, that's all.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:37]** That's all I got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** Uh, can I, which, which direction do I see the, do I hear the clicking in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Oh, you're a roll.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Roll me another perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Another 22.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Another 22.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:55]** So you hear it ahead of you, but it's definitely starting to echo from the side as well.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:02]** So you're starting to realize this whole entire area is just a mesh of different corridors, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:06]** And so the sounds that you're hearing are echoing off of different walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:17]** Um, so yeah, that, that sound you're, you're, you're kind of losing track of exactly where it's at, but it's, it's coming from like the Northeast region is what I'd say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Got it.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:22]** Um, so hearing Rolu check says, uh, trader says what?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Wait, what are we talking about?

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Chuck, you cut out there.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** I didn't hear what you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Nothing.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** It's more hallway.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Come on.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Come on.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** That clicking appears to be further on.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** I'm going to sneak across this corridor and we'll see if I can localize it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Okay, so just real quick, slow down.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** You guys are... So you're all moving up that center corridor?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Keep a distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Are you all moving that way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Yes.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** I see Thaddeus and Rolo moving forward.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Well...

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:02]** Thaddeus is going to roll stealth, but he's going to stay a bit behind Shaq because Shaq's scouting.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** Oh, God.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** Let's forget that he did that.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** Go ahead.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** What did you roll for yourself?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** I rolled a six.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Do you know what my modifier is?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** It's really high.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** I rolled a nine.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** It's really sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** Do you want me to pull up your Hero Lab?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Speaking of pulling up your Hero Lab, I added your Dash Co for you.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Maybe that's why you can't open it on your computer.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** I locked you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** Why would you do that, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Hacker man!

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Enhance.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** I'm kidding.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** I'm logging into Hero Lab.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:41]** Okay, so Chuck, while he's rolling his stealth, Rolo, you're moving up.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** Are you rolling stealth too, or you're just like right next to him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** I rolled a nine.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** That's what I told you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** Nine.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Okay.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** So like I said, you're right next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:56]** I imagine Chuck like floated on a bed of vines and tendrils silently to the corner.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:05]** And it's just like, as you guys are walking, you're bumping into loose panels and like drag rocks on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:13]** Rolo actually has all four arms up and out and just dragging his hands along the walls going along every panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Daddy is just like, shut up, Rolo.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Good Lord.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** But he's scraping along the ground with his claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** You don't want to talk.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** You literally just farted very loudly.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** Hey, shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Be quiet over there.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:32]** I'm trying to see if there's any other movement down these corridors while you're investigating.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** I knew I should have gone by myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** I love this so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** Okay, so Chuck.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** Show me where you're going to move one square at a time just so I can keep track of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:51]** So can I show you my destination where I would like to be?

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** You're going to ping it?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** Yeah.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** So like I want to move to that corner next like down the straight down.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** It veers off a bit to the right, but I'm like working my.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** But you're not going to go.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** I'm not going to move straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** You're not going to look at that corner yet.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** You're going to like go up and wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Right.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** You're stopping at that wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** I'm going to move one square at a time because that's what you asked me to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** No, but I see where you're going.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:18]** So you're moving forward, and then I talked about how it's almost like there's two sets of corridors that are staggered.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** And so there's those two panels of walls I was talking about.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:29]** So you're going to move up and kind of zigzag through them and then wait against the left side of that wall before it turns into the next corridor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** So like here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** No, right where you pinged.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** I'm just saying.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** But as you walk into this hallway...

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** You actually see at the end of the hall to the west.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** I don't know if you can see it on your map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** I cannot.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** You can't?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Because it's too far away.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Okay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** I could see it.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** I think I could see it here.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** All right.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** So you see something.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I see something.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Hey, guys.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** This track freezes.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Chuck, what is it?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** Guys, there's... He whispers into his communicator.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** Guys, there's something in the shadows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Sorry, let me do this real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** I'm going to like... And Termay's going to mind link with Chuck.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:18]** He's going to ask him, what is it that you think you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** Is it a... It's a... A ghost?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** A ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:35]** And as you are telling him this, what you actually see is a human male with long black hair in a lab coat.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** And he walks north out of sight.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Oh, that's creepy.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Tommy?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Tommy.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** It's Tommy.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Yeah, played by Tommy Wussop.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Oh, hi, Mark.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** Oh, hi, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Hi, Mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:57]** Was there any recognition on the dude in the lab coat?

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:01]** Did he see me and move up, or was he just moving in that direction coincidentally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** He did not see you, if that's your question.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** He did not respond to you.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:12]** I can't see anything on the map because Kev did a great job of laying out the dynamic lighting.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:17]** So just hearing Vinny say it as if he's... A ghost.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:26]** Yeah, it's so perfect to see Jack look around the corner and you just see a human male with long hair just turn the corner right as you look.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Oh, God, it's so creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** But just another couple of notes for you.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:37]** In this corridor, you see a doorway along the corridor to your left.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** You see a doorway to the south.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** And then to the right, you see two doors connecting.

**[00:32:42 - 00:33:12]** to the south so again the walls to your north are kind of dividers and they have all sorts of electronic equipment dials and gauges but the walls to the south are clearly leading into rooms that may or may not be connected to the other side that you saw earlier okay Chuck seeing life and movement wants to change and go to the west to like see if he can catch up to said ghost that's a pretty shock thing to do

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** without even a wisdom save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:22]** Jack is like, he is the curiosity that killed the cat.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** Yes.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Hopefully not this cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:29]** That's his middle name, Curiosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Actually, I do help this cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** Chuck Curiosity Wussow.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** So let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Okay, so let's finish your movement.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** You're going to then move westbound, and your goal is to get to the end of that hallway?

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** So let's stop halfway, and then we'll see what anybody else is doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:49]** Hey, so did you guys, hey, you're pushing forward or what?

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Chuck just disappeared around the corner.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Well, I can still mind link with Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** I'm following this ghost, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:00]** Hey, guys, Chuck's going up ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Why?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Come on.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** All right, support Chuck.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** So we all walk up to the front of the corridor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:18]** Yeah, and I'm going to be just, Tremaine's going to be in the back doing kind of like rear security, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Holding his face in his hands in disappointment.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Seriously.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** Well, I'm right behind Shaq.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** I'm right behind.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Thaddeus has my six.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** Thaddeus.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** Okay, so you guys come along.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** We're going to follow for the ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:39]** mystery ink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:46]** This big dog behind you and a man in a green shirt.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** I don't know if this is a good idea.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:52]** I'm not Matthew Lillard.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** I can't do Shaggy.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** Gee willikers, Scoob.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** Oh, gee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** I used to be able to.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Oh, no, Reggie.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** You're just going to reset up, gang.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Pay attention.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** You guys are moving.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:14]** You move up and to the left in the first set of corridors, and you guys stop right about a doorway.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** There's a doorway to your south.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** What do you guys want to do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** Uh, Shaq wants to keep going.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** Did the dude go through the doorway?

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** So, like, dude, dude went through, are you asking this on your mind link?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Yes.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Yeah, did you see where he went?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** Did he go through that door, or did he go through something else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:40]** He was, he was at the end of this hall and went north, so we need, if I'm gonna keep following him, I need to go to the corner and make a right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** I suppose, yeah, if you want to keep going.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** Try carefully, everyone.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Is there anything about this door?

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** Are you a little nervous about it, as I am?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** I think it's the best lead we've seen on what happened to this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** Let's do it.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:03]** I mean, like, we're all in, like, communicating distance at this point.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Yeah.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Do we hear anything else scurrying around?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** Like, that's what Termay's been... Well, that was all via Mindlink.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** Yeah, that was done in Mindlink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I'm curious about this door.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** Perhaps there are other rooms here that could shed light on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Rolu looking for light cause he can't see anything.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Um, let's, let's split up gang.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** So, okay.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:31]** And at the end of the hallway, you also see a, another double door, big metallic double doors, right?

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Um, so what, what are you guys talking about doing?

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Are you talking about going through the door to the South or are you talking about going to the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** I'm trying to, I mean, I'm investigating where we are.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:46]** I am following behind chalk, uh, doing effectively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** I like that.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** I can see what you see.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Yeah.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** I think we should follow the ghostly figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:53 - 00:37:02]** I'm effectively trying to, like, suss this area, right, behind us as we are moving forward nervously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Okay, so you're kind of just pulling up the rear.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** You're walking backwards almost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** Yeah, because I don't know how far into this thing we're going.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:14]** And then occasionally... I think this might be a good spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** I don't know.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:20]** Should I put up a booby trap or... Yeah, I think I'm going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Okay.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** I'm going to put up... Is this our first official booby trap of all of Will Save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** No, because we did the one in...

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** In book one.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** This is a very Will thing, which I like.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** It is a very Will thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:43]** He always comes prepared with this kind of – even with our D&D game, he was – Dropping ball bearing balls, just to clarify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** This is a good rally point.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:50]** We know this is just going to go off if something moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** So I had – So what exactly are you dropping here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:57]** I'm going to put in just a... Is this a spell or... Flash grenade.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:12]** A flash grenade with a mark one proximity switch, which does a plus eight perception check to... That's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Yeah.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** I'm for this, but is there some kind of engineering check to put that together?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** Uh, let me double check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** No, it's like paint by numbers.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** I'm going to say there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Yeah.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** I'm pretty sure it's paint by numbers.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Best, best manual you've ever seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Yeah.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:34]** So the best manual that I've ever seen was for this super cheap, uh, online purchase of a like toilet paper holder.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** It's like a toilet paper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:41]** The patent for the toilet paper roll that just has it over the front.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Cause that is the correct way to put it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:43]** Mm hmm.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:50]** No, no, this is just a, like a, a stand that holds, it's like a, it's got a big door that holds like three or four toilet paper things.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:54]** You close that and it's got a little like flip top for the other toilet paper that we'll be actually using.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:59]** Anyways, the actual instructions for are amazing as, and I'm, I'm an engineer.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:03]** I've taken classes on like how to, to better give instructions on to build things.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** And they had like, uh,

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:23]** asymmetric installation so you couldn't put the wrong side on the right side you had to put the right on the right side the instructions actually had like it was a red color so it would be like this one has a different tab than that one and it would highlight that tab in red and like it was just the instructions were just phenomenal and they weren't even in english

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Anyways, moving on.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** So you made a proximity switch on a flash grenade, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Yes.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:39]** So if it's a friendly, it's not going to kill them, but it's going to blind them potentially if they come in contact with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Love it.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:45]** Okay, and the proximity switch, you said it's paint by number, you're ready to just like boop boop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:45 - 00:40:04]** Yeah, it's a standard action, and I can set a timer within one minute, and then basically it does a bonus equal to eight with a perception check for any creature doing, I forget, whatever the opposing DC is, but yeah, just like an opposing roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** It's got a timer and a proximity switch.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Now I'm confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** I sent you the information in the chat if you want to read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Yeah, it's in the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Oh, man, that's a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** I can't read this fast.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** It sounds like you've got an option.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** You can either put a fuse on it or you can put a proximity sensor on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:26]** Well, I'm putting it proximity, but it has a one-minute countdown for me to get out of the way of that proximity.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** That makes sense.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** You can arm proximity switch with a one-minute countdown.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Yeah, it's armed after that one minute.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** That makes sense.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Okay, so you're going to hit the switch, step away.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Yeah.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** Erase your purple thing, and I'll take care of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** Yeah, so are we going down that hole, Chuck?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Whoops.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** I just deleted everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** I think we should.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** That's fine.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Delete everything.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** I mean, I deleted myself from the map.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** I can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** Yeah, he is.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Control Z. Do Control Z. I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** It doesn't work.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Get it together, gang.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Oh, wait.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Maybe it did.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Did that work?

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** There it is.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** You're back.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Is that you, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** I hit Control Z. I don't know if it was for you or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** I don't know, but now I can't remove my purple thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** That I can try to worry about myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:16]** Anyways, what I think I'll do is... Is there some rubble that I could disguise it in an area nearby?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Nice.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Or depress?

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** It looks like there's something right behind you.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** Yeah, is this maybe here in this junction?

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** Yeah, keep drawing stuff on my screen so I can't erase it.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Thanks, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** You can click on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** No, I can't.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** It won't let me.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** I finally got some of it.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** Anyways, so just you guys move on, right?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I will take care of the proximity switch thing.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** You're going to put it in that rubble.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Got it.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** The proximity switch is good for that 10-foot area, I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Are we good with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Let me just double check.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** It's five feet from that point.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** Okay.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Five feet from that area?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** So, yeah, like one foot.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Yeah.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** Okay.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** So now what?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** You guys are moving down further into the hall to the right or to the left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** The west.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** The west.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Smart move.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Starboard side because we're actually facing backwards on the ship.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** If you guys know what that is.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Navy lingo.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** Yay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Let's keep moving.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** All right.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Your lead, Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** All right.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:23]** I'm going to keep chasing that ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:45]** and let's let's do it check moves to the corner don't give up the ghost um hold it up the rear guys okay pause at the end of that hallway for a second while i oh look i just found a a claymore that's what you get that is your device is a claymore booyah love it love me a claymore

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Love it.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Bam.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** It's hidden behind the rocks.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** Good to go.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:55]** Okay, so that hallway is pretty secure, and then now you get to the end of the hallway.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:03]** There is, again, the door behind you to the south, and then there's these big metal doors right in front of you, and the corridor splits north and south.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** What now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:14]** Thaddeus, keep a mental note of these doors so we can go back and have a look at them once we find this ghost.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:18]** Jack looks around for any signs of... Sorry, I'll let you respond to that.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Okay.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:24]** I'll also... Thanks, Thaddeus.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Hold on, let me wait.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:32]** Are there any signs of this man lab researcher poltergeist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Not from where you're standing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Okay.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:43]** Guys, I'm going to go around this corner, see if I can find anything, but I don't see any signs.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** I wonder if I was seeing something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Just a question.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** Yeah.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** What are you holding in your hands, all of you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** Are you about to be mugged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:00]** I'm holding my Venom for me and Venomcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:09]** I'm holding my staff and my tactical semi-auto pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** I don't think Jack is holding anything.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** I think he probably put it away to try to be more stealthy.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Does holding a weapon actually... No, that's purely flavor.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I don't think so.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Not mechanically, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:42]** for story purposes i mean the appearance flavor he puts it away i'm okay with that yeah right like it would be a potential friendly right so you guys are all armed except for jack is what i heard yep yes okay uh go ahead chalk why if you're gonna step out step out can i do it stealthily step up yeah go ahead give me a self-check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** 19 to go around the corner and up.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** How far can I go on that single roll?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:53]** I don't want to overstep because of lighting and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Sorry, what's your question?

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** How far can you move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** How far can I move with that before having to make another roll?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** Because I haven't looked around the corner yet and I don't want to reveal something I shouldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** I don't know.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Is there a rule for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** I'd say one full movement.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Is it so like...

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:19]** cool so your call or is it a half speed i don't i don't let's say half speed so sure okay no no stop stop stop yeah

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Here, I'll move you.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** Thank you.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:25]** Okay, so you're going to step out and around this corner, right?

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** So you kind of just like tiptoe around this corner.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** There's, again, the door at the end of the hallway.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** You walk right past that.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:37]** What you see as you step around that corner, there's this cutout in the wall.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Let me get to it.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Okay.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:46]** There's a niche in the hallway that looks just big enough to hold a medium-sized creature.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:55]** There's a thick metal cord hanging from a port in the center of the wall with blue lights flashing down the length of it.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** And there's a small glowing pad at the bottom of this niche that hums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Chuck, do you see anything interesting?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:09]** Yeah, I'm going to amend that movement now that I have all of this new information and look more closely at that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** Thaddeus, let's step up to the end of the hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:19]** Treme, there's like a big crevasse.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:25]** It's like a cutout in the wall with some sort of wiring harness.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** There's blue lights that are glowing down it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:32]** It's a niche, and I looked this up on Google to make sure I was saying it right.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** A niche?

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Not a niche.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** It's a niche.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Corn to Google.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** A Nike.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Nike.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** All right, and as you do that, explosion!

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** No, I'm kidding.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Okay, so you guys all come to the end of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:49]** Yeah.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Where's this panel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Rolo's going to step out.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** I lost Thaddeus.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Where's Thaddeus?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** There he is.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Okay, you guys are standing on top of each other.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I mean...

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** So this niche is right there.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Yeah.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** You see no sign of the ghost either way.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** So I want to look closer at that panel at the bottom, like just to figure out what this niche is for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:13]** Yeah, is there like a directory of this facility somewhere?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Is there power?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:21]** There's definitely power in the building because you see the glowing blue and you can hear the hum of the energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** I think that turret ran out of electricity, so there's probably power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Yeah.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Roll is going to do an engineering check.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Okay.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Go ahead and roll it for me.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Roll, Lou.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** 14.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Somebody want to assist that?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** No?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Yeah, I can assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** You're like, oh, it looks like a panel.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** I assist.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Check also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** Yeah, I think I've seen that before.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** One time when I was outside...

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:58]** System in... I forget where, but... The system is old, but it checks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Do I know anything on my 16?

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Plus whatever.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** I had a 14 plus 2.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** Plus 4.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Because Jack also assisted.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:13]** I think with a 16, you know enough to not want to touch it.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** You hear the humming.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** You see the blue cable.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:20]** You're like, those are probably electrical prongs.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** But that's about all you know.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** What about an 18?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** You know that it has 240 volts.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Ooh.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Oh.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Whoa.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:32]** Well, it won't run my toaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:36]** I think there's two hot legs on this one, not just one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** I'm not an electrician by any means, so that was just a random number I pulled.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** I think 240 is what my... Anyways.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** It was a good guess.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Yeah, no, that's a good guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** It was.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Three-phase power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** Yep.

**[00:48:46 - 00:49:09]** all right way to go yeah there's there's three phases there's yeah i used to know all that stuff okay so what do you guys want to do you're at the end of this hallway um you're at this niche i want to know more more about this door to the west this double door that we're standing in front of you think this uh maybe is the power for the red light it's dark in here right it's dark in there it is dim lit there is a

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** There's emergency lighting.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:14]** So, like, there's actually an orange glow and a reddish glow.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Oh, boy, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** You know, like, for just emergency lighting.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** Got it.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** Thaddeus can see around the end of the corner.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:29]** It looks like there's light spilling out from a room around the corner, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Your ghost might be in there, Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Guys, I think I lost him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** I'm not sure what you see, to be honest.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** I can't see it from my screen.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** I wonder if we should... I can see it a little bit, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:41]** What are you going to say?

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** I think it's like blue light spilling out into a dark hallway.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Okay.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** I think it's the next hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Yes, you're correct.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** At the very end of the hall.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:57]** So where you guys are standing now, that niche is at the end of one of those long barricaded areas I was telling you about that have just like a bunch of electronics and stuff in the wall.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** So is this niche with these power cords.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:07]** And then next to you, there is another wall with – there's a door.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** And you can actually see there's two doors from where you can see.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** There's one on the south side of the door there.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:36]** or the the wall here i'm going to click it which is easier just for me to click because i can't explain it um and then the corridor going north there is a a door to on the east side about halfway up that wall and then at the very end it kind of just makes a hard right and there's another corridor and that is where you're seeing the light shine from there's a dim blue light bluish green teal whatever

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:41]** But Rolly was asking about the door to the left, the western door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Yeah, the big double door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Yes.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** The far starboard side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Yes.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** The one we're presently in front of.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Is it doors or ghosts?

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Yes.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Where would you like to go?

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:01]** Well, now that you bring to our attention the light spilling out at the end of the hall, I don't want to give up the ghost, as they say.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** So perhaps we should stay focused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** Is that a phrase of some sort?

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:06]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** I don't know.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:39]** suppose should i set another one of these proximity switches as we uh get as we chase down or what well i i worry that we might how many do you have in your your inventory uh so i have three switches and i can attach them to use one down sorry you've already used one so now you have two left yes or you have three left okay i think we might want to be as judicious where we put them and not paint i can recover i would imagine all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** It was an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** So if we go by them, we don't?

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:48]** You said if friendlies trigger them, then they just get... It does go off or doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** So it goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Yeah, it just goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:57]** And I'm going to say the way you set it up is going to determine which way you can... You can't approach it from the opposite side that you set it up from.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** I'm going to hold you to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:08]** So like, no, but I'm saying just mechanically speaking, anyone can do an engineering check to disable it or to defeat it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Right.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** But like I, what I'm saying is that you're setting up a proxy switch head, you know, that's pointing North and East.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:20]** I'm not going to let you do an engineering check from the Northeast and say like, Oh no, it's, it's, it's five, it's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** It's a, it's a radius, anything moving within five feet.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** So it's a radius of five feet.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:29]** It's just, it's, it is mechanically what it is.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** There's no choosing direction or anything like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:37]** Let's not set one up here just in case we need to exit this way quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Agreed.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:45]** Thaddeus' ears twitch and he's listening for the metallic sounds of that bot to see if he might be around the corner where the ghost went.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** I did.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** It's a four, so if anyone else wants to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** You rolled a four.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** You actually just hear the hum of that electronic equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:58]** Guys, I think I might have lost that ghost.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** Do we want to circle back and explore some rooms?

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** Or do we want to try to press on and see if we can find it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Personally, I want to find it.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:13]** I mean, that light at the end of the tunnel, it's got to lead somewhere, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** I know.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Rolu, I'm sorry.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Thaddeus, I'm surprised you asked what I thought.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:30]** I'm thinking we should perhaps get a lay of the land before, as Treme said, going to these possibly dazzling lights.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:34]** So perhaps choose a door, either one in the hallway behind us.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** All right, so which door do you guys want to go in?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:46]** Again, there's the big double doors at the end of the hallway straight ahead in front of you, or there is the one door to the south.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:50]** You could also go back to the original corridor, and there are several doors along those walls.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** I think we should go through the double door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Rolo puts a hand on your shoulder.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** I agree.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:58]** I'm right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** He puts two hands on top and rubs your shoulders real deep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Oh, God.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** So uncomfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:13]** I'm not even going to joke roleplay.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** All the hair on his body goes up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** All the hair on Kelly's body just stood up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Yeah.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** I think my hair is standing up, too.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Okay, so you're going to open the double doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:33]** From a metagaming perspective, these double doors are right at the left edge of the map, and it feels like we're walking into a world of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** They are beyond the scope of this adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** It might lead to a whole new map, for all you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Perhaps.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** All right, do you want to check out the little door?

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** I can't metagame this.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** No, don't let that stop you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** You've already chosen one.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** Kelly, you guys line up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Double door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** I think it's more like a military tactic, right?

**[00:54:53 - 00:55:05]** So, like, weps being the weps, but, like, Rolu shows that he is tactically aware when he puts one shoulder or one hand on your shoulder because he's got his other two hands along his rifle and probably his weapon, his hand weapon.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** What do you have for a hand weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Wait, where's his fourth hand?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** What's that do?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Wouldn't you like to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Stop touching him.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** He's touching me.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** I don't want that.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:19]** He's got his Venomcaster up and he pushes the button.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:25]** He's painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Sketching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** When he pushes the button, nothing happens.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** The door doesn't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Anyone want to do a check on this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** You guys have to do an engineering check or just try to, I don't know, crank it up with some strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Who's going to do an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Who's the strongest person here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** It's definitely 18.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Definitely for the strongest mental strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Your engineering check.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:56]** You look at this door and you can see that like it's not energized and it's going to require like a manually opening.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** It means that the bot is not through these doors at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:07]** This might be a fortified door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Get your hand off of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Do we hear the clinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Yeah, it's fortified.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** The clinking has never stopped.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Where is the clinking coming from?

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** Can I roll a perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** Let's get this door open first.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Oh, you rolled a 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** Rolo, Rolo, help me with this door, all right?

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** Just take your hand off and put it on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** Thaddeus, I haven't had my hand on you for at least two minutes.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Oh, my God, Rolo, you're creeping me out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** I've been trying to understand where this clinking is coming from for this whole time, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** So you rolled a 20 for the clinking.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:43]** You hear it's just coming from behind you because you're looking at that door for a second.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** Then you turn around, you look back down the hallway, and you just hear it from almost all directions.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** It's just somewhere.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:54]** You're on the far left side of this map, and it's somewhere on the right side of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** here-ish.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** I didn't even see where you pinged.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:08]** I love this idea that Thaddeus and I are working on the door, Jack is standing in front of this power, and Torme is like, guys, the clinking, he's like, it's like in your head.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Go ahead, ping again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Ping again where you think it's at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** I don't know, man.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Maybe like here.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:21]** Torme, I need your eyes on this door right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** I don't know what you're going on about.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:29]** There's this clicking back here on this other side of this corridor where we were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** We will deal with that.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Let's stay focused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** What do you want me to do?

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Just stay calm for now.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Keep an eye out.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** What was your strength check?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Strength check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** I still didn't see your ping.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Ping it one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** I just figured it was like here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Maybe here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** 20, 20, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** I don't know.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Oh, it's here, here, or here.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** He's pinging all up and down the east side of this map.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** So, yes, it's somewhere in that region.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Good job.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** What was your number on the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** This is where I thought it was.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** It's 20.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** 20.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** Wow, I'm really strong right now, Rulu.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** What's your check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:33]** right so you you actually like uh you take your venom caster it's probably got a bayonet kind of on the front of it you stick the bayonet between the doors and you just crank it and the doors actually follow suit and they they slide open and there's a wall of dirt and some of it actually falls down and and hits your feet so like can't open this door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:39]** Okay, dirt, but, like, is plausible to be in this desert, or would we expect sand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** It's red sand.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Yes.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** Yes, it is definitely Akatonian earth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Got it.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Oh, no.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:55]** Does this mean that it just crashed into the... We can't get... Hey, uh... This is probably, like, airlock or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Garbage, I don't know.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Wait, wait.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:03]** You know, Thaddeus... Thaddeus, why don't you... Jack, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:12]** I know your primary expertise is in tactics and weapons, but I'm pretty sure this is sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:14]** Yes.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:19]** If you would like to need at all Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** That's what he's doing.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** He's kneading.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Like trying to get there.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** It's like a litter box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:29]** I was going to say he poops in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** He covers it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Get out of here.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** I'm not sticking around for this while you open a little box.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** All right, Thaddeus.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Dude, Thaddeus.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** It looks like Torme just went south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:46]** Okay, so Thaddeus, he takes his shit and he covers it up with his foot.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Just kicks some dirt on it.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:52]** And as he's doing that, Thaddeus, or Torme, marches to the end of that hallway.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** 16.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** But you have night vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** I have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Same thing.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** It's night vision.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:11]** You have goggles.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** All right.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Check your map again.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:23]** I'm curious whether or not... You only have 60 feet of... Okay.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:27]** But you do hear, very clearly, clink, clink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** There's something here, guys.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** I can hear it.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Let's go check it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:59]** jack like toddles up beside him to me are you at the end of the hall sorry what do you mean you're in the same hallway man it's tough to see i i i don't have the same it's where we came in i speaking about tactics why are we engaging the robot so i'm just gonna come up slow i'm gonna try and come up slow or say like hey we should go up like back the direction we were just to see it let's do it right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** Go ahead.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Roll me.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Where are you rolling?

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Where are you walking to?

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Ping where you're going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** I'm going to go here.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** So a foot at a time.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Sorry.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Like where we entered, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Okay.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:25]** So just for the listener, they kind of went up and around a rectangular area that has doors on the north and the south side leading into that area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** In a counterclockwise fashion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:53]** counterclockwise right so now we're on the left south left southwest side of the map um at the corner there and termay is talking about going back to the entrance which is about 60 feet i said 30 earlier or 30 earlier and i was wrong um okay go ahead move wherever you're gonna move to and just a curious question are you doing it with stealth or without


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:53 - 01:02:04]** I mean, I would assume I'm trying to be stealthily, not trying to give away anything or, you know.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** But I'll roll for it.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** That was a natural one on stealth.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:17]** So I trip over something, I imagine, as I creep forward on my very first step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:20]** So move as far as you're going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:20]** Okay.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:26]** And as you do that, you actually trip and fall.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** And there's a clunk, clunk.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** To me.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** It's probably a deeper tone.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Clunk.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:36]** As you hit the metal and you stand, you push yourself back up with all four arms.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** You get to the end of that hallway.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:43]** You're now at the front entrance area, that intersection.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:46]** Roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Great.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** You see...

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:03]** What looks like a large anthropod raised up on six legs.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:12]** Red luminescence runs along each leg between the segments of its carapace up two large antennae.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Antennae?

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** Whatever.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** It's antennae.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** I looked it up on Google again.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:23]** And out of two large gills, one on each side.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Gills.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]** Let me just show you a picture of this real quick.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Is it friendly?

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** Nothing else is in this freaking boat.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:36]** Diplomacy.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** Here you go.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** I'm showing it to everybody.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Does somebody else want to describe this thing for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** Looks like it.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:45]** I'm not going to lie.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** It's kind of cute.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:49]** It looks like a really thick anglerfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:54]** Yeah, like a metallic anglerfish with these intense feet that look like they could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** Yeah, but also a little bit like a crawdad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:06]** Yeah, like the scales and ridges of a shrimp head and then one big uni eye, like a, yeah, RoboCop eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Yeah, it looks cool.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:15]** I mean, the mask looks like sort of grievancy from Star Wars.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** It looks like it runs on coal.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** It's kind of dope.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Yeah, it does.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** It's just like a bunch of smoke coming out of the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:27]** It has this little antenna on the bottom and a thruster.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:31]** It looks like probably can move pretty quick, I'm imagining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:33]** Wait, what?

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** Was, like, blue sparks coming out of it?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Is that what that is?

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** Is it, like, assembled by space goblins or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:42]** I think Rulu stepped around the corner when he heard Treme fall just to try and see what he can.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** Rulu's squinting.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** Treme, are you all right?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Oops.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:48]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:51]** There's a f***ing security robot here.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** I'm going to duck out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Good call.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Don't move anywhere.

**[01:04:55 - 01:05:05]** You stay right where you're at because what you do notice is there is a little green light kind of passing around in a circle on the face of this thing.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:10]** And as you stepped up and fell, that light turned red.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:19]** And as that creature moves closer, you hear the familiar clink, clink, clink, clink.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Oh.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Nice knowing you, Rolo.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** I think Rolo's about to get curb stomped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:27]** Wait, what?

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Not Rolo.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:28]** I think it's Tremé.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** I think Tremé's about to get curb stomped.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:30]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:34]** I was like, Chuck's going to pick up Rolo and just carry him forward.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** No, no, this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:38]** I'm not a traitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]** You don't know my side of the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:49]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:55]** Until next week, drift begones on Distant Stars.
