## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:13]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:13]** Get in.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:15]** Restore balance.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:17]** Get out.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:30]** This is Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:33]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:56]** All right.

**[00:00:57 - 00:00:59]** Welcome back to Unknown Treasures.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:08]** Again, just to reiterate, this is a part of We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** Episode 10.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:15]** 10 episodes.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:15]** 10 episodes.

**[00:01:15 - 00:01:16]** How does it feel?

**[00:01:16 - 00:01:18]** Can we do a quick GM check-in, Kev?

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** I hate it so much.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:21]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** I'm just not built to be a GM.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** I'm having a lot of fun.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:30]** It is really fun to play with you guys.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:35]** But like GMing, it just eats away at my ADD so bad.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:40]** I have so many things open and so many things I have to like try to keep, you know,

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** on top of my mind.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** And then you guys are like talking and I'm not listening.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:46]** Cause I'm too busy reading something or like looking at what's going to happen next.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** It's just, Oh, this is stressful.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** It's so stressful.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** Thank you to every GM out there, um, for doing what you do.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** And I, I like people are like, man, I love GMing.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** And I'm like,

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** You do it.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I love playing.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** I love that journey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Yeah.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** And I will gladly play at your table anytime.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** I think before we go into... I know, I'm sorry.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:20]** Again, as the GM, I'm kind of getting sidetracked of like... I'm following our Discord.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Thank you to everybody on our Discord.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It's very active.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:29]** Find us on Twitter or Facebook or wherever else to find an easy way to get to our Discord because it's Discord and it's complicated to get in there.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** We'll definitely post that link for you guys as well.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:36]** But our Discord is fantastic and our paralegals are on it.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** They are weighing in on the mounted rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** If you have an opinion on this...

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** three of the paralegals are really at it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:50]** Yeah, they're having a full-on debate while we're trying to figure this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:57]** Yeah, so we don't even know yet what... So we're still... There's still a... The firm's still debating amongst themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:10]** Yeah, so until they settle, which we're going to allow them to do that, we are going to be sticking to our rule of you can stay on any character you want, but...

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:17]** you have to forfeit your move in the next turn if you're going to stay with that character if they move.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Does that make sense?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Does anybody have any questions on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** I mean, I get it.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** I feel like it should be more generous.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** I think it should be a little bit more generous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:28]** But we'll see what the... You want to say it's a swift action, but you would lose your reaction then?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Is that the case?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** I think it would be like a balance check.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Here's where I would go with it.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** I agree with that.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** If the mount is not hit, we can use it as a swift action.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** If the mount takes damage, it has to be a move to stay on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I think that's good.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** So when I'm on Thaddeus' back, Thaddeus gets stabbed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** And you're constantly riding his back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** This is... Chak is a small gentleman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** That is definitely a stipulation, and this is that Chak is small, so he's the only one allowed.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** Or he's tiny, so he's the only one allowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Chak is tiny.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Right.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** I think Rolu's incredibly swole as well.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** He's not, actually.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** He's not swole.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** I think Thaddeus is swole.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** We're both swole.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** This is why we have so much tension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:21]** I do want to say, though, so far in the conversations going on in Discord, they did point out that, Chuck, you're not weightless.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** And so you do weigh, and we looked it up, you weigh one bulk.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:31]** So, John, make sure you add one bulk to you if Chuck is on your shoulders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Right.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** And, Chuck, you have one bulk of equipment already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** So it's two bulks?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** So I get two bulks.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Chuck is two bulk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** And everybody needs to keep this in mind, because Chuck can jump on anybody's shoulder.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It's going to add that weight to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Chuck a jump on a kapok, for all we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Yeah.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Well, that's different.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** You've got to roll survival checks, and that's riding a wild animal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Threaten me with a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:56]** Anyways, it adds that weight to you, so just keep that in mind.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:02]** Make sure you're paying attention to your weight limits and whether or not you're encumbered, and we'll take that on as it comes along.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Rolo, I think you're fine, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** Yeah, I'm at four out of ten.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** So I'm one away from being in comfort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** You're also one away from dying.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** But let's roll into â€“ I didn't mean to distract you guys.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** How's everything going this week?

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** It's been a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** It's great.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** I'm broken.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** What?

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I broke an air conditioner this week.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** That was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** My AC hasn't worked all summer, so I'm sweating as we say.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Rawr.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** This is a fun story for you guys.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** I just ran down to check on my family because I love them.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:41]** And my son, my wife pointed out that my son saw Ed Sheeran on the TV and said, dad, dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** Oh, I could see that.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** Yeah, I could totally see that.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** What do you mean no?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** It's a good thing.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** It's a compliment, man.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** Is it?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** He's not a very handsome person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** He's handsome.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Do you have a tiny guitar that you play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** I'm not a musician by any means, no.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** You play a small guitar.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Yeah.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** Grayson might play a small guitar at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Get him a uke.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Dude, ukes are great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** And I do have a question for you guys.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** Should I drink my rum and Dr. Pepper separately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Or should I pour my Dr. Pepper into my rum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Separate, but like double hand.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** That's really nice rum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Most rum, no.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** That rum, yes.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** This rum is very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Keep it separate?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** Keep it separate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Sounds fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Cheers.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Cheers, my dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Cheers, man.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Cheers.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** Cool.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** So everybody's good?

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Everybody's feeling like toasty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** I mean, I'm toasty because I just turned off my AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, that's right, man.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** It's effing hot in America.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:51]** Real quick, we're ruling on this mounted thing because the rules paralegals are still discussing it.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** No, it's still up for debate.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** It's still open for change.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Okay, all right.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** We'll come back to it later then, I guess.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Current established.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Current situation is what?

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Move action to stay on or are we going move slash swift?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** I like the way you said it.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:06]** It's a swift action to stay on, which means you lose your reaction.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:30]** yeah right um it's swift touch to stay on but if the mount is hit then it's a move action which that keeps everything that happened in the last round um within our rules copacetic copacetic yeah that's a big word i don't really know the definition of i probably used it wrong cool cool it just means it's all good i think yeah i think so yeah uh satisfactory in excellent order

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:51]** in excellent order excellent excellent excellent all right cool as for you listeners out there i really hope you guys are staying cool because like i said it is a hot summer staying cool as a cucumber doesn't even matter where you're at unless you're on the southern hemisphere because then it's the opposite um moving on

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:55]** Is there anything else we need to cover before we get into our mini game?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** I don't think so.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Mini game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Let's do a mini interview thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Our mini interview thing, yes.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Our minterview.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** Last time we did a roll-off.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** This time I think we should just do good old-fashioned rock, paper, scissors.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** I didn't say nose goes.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Vinny won nose goes right off the bat.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** So go ahead.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** On three, throw up a rock or a scissor.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** One, two, three.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Paper versus paper.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** That was so late, Kelly.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** This is kind of laggy, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:30]** You guys were late, and you also did the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:35]** I don't think rock, paper, scissors is good for Zoom, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** All right, let's try it one more time, but this time just do it verbally.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I want you to shout out whatever your choice is.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** It's still the same issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** No, no, just say it at the same time.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** But the lag, though.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** All right, whatever.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah, I got what you're saying.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** You never know, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Three, two, one, go.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Paper.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** You guys both said paper again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** Paper twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Benny, you're supposed to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** Kelly and I are just like right there.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** We're on that same wavelength.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Roll some dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** Dude, we like the same cars as well.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** It's like a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** This is not going to work out between Vinny and I. Three, two, one, go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Scissors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** Paper, paper, scissors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Three in a row.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Statistically, that shouldn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** It shouldn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Unless they're identical humans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** They're cloned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** A bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Okay, different.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** I'm going to grab a quarter.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** Hang on.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** That's way better.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** You should slip a coin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** I don't know what I did with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I'll grab a quarter.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** I had a nice Ravens and Riddles flip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** But I think I put them in my travel bag and I don't know where I... I've got a D2 from... What do you call it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Do it, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** If you've got it, do it.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Yeah, Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:58]** It's at the bottom of my... D2s are just fancy plastic coins.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** I've got to get a good D2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** For sure.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Order from Kraken.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** They always give you right.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Kelly, do you want heads or tails?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Let's go with heads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Whatever you would have picked, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Which would be heads, I'm guessing.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** It's heads.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** So does this mean I don't go or I do go?

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Kevin.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Yeah, is it like your choice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** It'd be your choice.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** You called it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Right.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** We'll go football rules.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** You win the coin toss.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** You get to pick to defer or take the ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** There it is.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** All right, I'll just do it.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** All right, so Thaddeus, what's happening now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** Come on down.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** If you want to take a seat, we've already got the camera set up.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** The lights are a little bright, but we need that for a good image.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** If you want to take a seat, though, there's a bottle of water.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** We can get you something else to drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** Maybe some tea.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** One sugar, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** And the director kind of waves off in the corner at one of the PAs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Do I really have to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Uh, yeah, sorry, it's just kind of part of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:04]** You just gotta... Right, I don't remember seeing it in the contract, but... It was definitely there.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** It is covered under press and marketing, apparently.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** I don't know.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** You'll be hearing from my lawyer later, but I'll be cooperative for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** Well, it's just real fast, just look right into the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** Yeah, chop chop on that tea, please.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Waiting.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Alright.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** You're gonna wait for the tea?

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** No, no, I'm coming up with three things while you get the tea.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:31]** And there's also a bowl of M&M's, a bowl of Skittles, and a bowl of wrapped caramels from 1920.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** He's just going to go for Skittles.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I mean, come on.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** It's obviously the best choice.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** So Thaddeus is just picking out Skittles, putting them in his face.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** I missed out on this candy choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** You'll get your chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** I don't think you've gone anywhere.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:57]** I think after mine, they've definitely upgraded the facility, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:03]** Torme, as the yeoman for the ship, is standing behind the cameras because he's coordinating it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:13]** I feel like Rolo is off near the refreshment cart, and he's going to put a second cube of sugar, and that is too easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** That's hilarious.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** Thaddeus is, like, chewing on the Skittles.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:21]** He's, you know, like, and then just, like, smiling at, like, Tremaden.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** I'm curious where Chak will be once we find out.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** All right.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** I'm ready.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** All right, go ahead.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Whenever you're ready.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** All right, so.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Three, two, go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:36]** Hello, listeners at home, kids, gentlemen and ladies.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** Why does Thaddeus, I have a question for you.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** Why does Thaddeus not like Wooloo?

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Here's three options.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:49]** One, Wooloo is as swole as Thaddeus is and he feels threatened in his masculinity.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:50 - 00:13:02]** Two, Rolu wanted to be an artist and is jealous of... Excuse me, Thaddeus wanted to be an artist and is jealous that Rolu is a somewhat accomplished artist himself.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** And...

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:17]** Three, Rolu has killed many creatures of many different origins, and he has the highest kill count for... What's your race again, Rolu?

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Kasotham.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Kasotham.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** How do I not remember that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Kasotham.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** Thanks, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** These Skittles are good.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Which is it?

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** One of these is a lie.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** Wait.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** These Skittles are good.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** That's the lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** There's two reasons why he doesn't like him.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** One of them is a lie.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Wait.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Was the third one you said that Rolo has the highest kill count?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** No, no, no.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** That's obviously not true, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** There's no way.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Sorry.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** That's Kelly talking.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** No, no.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** There's...

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Okay.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** All right, all right.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** No, no.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** This is what Thaddeus said.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** He's killed lots of different types of creatures because he's a jerk.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** And he killed the most Kasothans of all the creatures he's killed.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** That's basically what he said.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** So he doesn't like Kasothans, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:18]** So just to clarify, you're saying that one, you wanted to be an artist and you're jealous of Rolu.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Yeah.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:23]** Two, Rolu is much stronger than you are.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Same strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Same strength.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** He just feels threatened because he's like kind of getting close.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Okay.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Slightly strong.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:37]** And then the third thing is that you've killed more Kasothans than any other creature and that you don't like Kasothans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:42]** Yeah, just because he's like, I could get Rolly, but he's my crew member, so I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** I don't know.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:47]** I mean, Mike, I think the obvious answer is that you're not an artist.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** I think that's the lie, is that you don't care about art at all.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** It's not your thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** You view it as weakness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** What do you guys think?

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Will, Vinny, John?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** You can't just agree with me.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** You have no opinions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** I think the lie is that he likes Skittles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** That was separate.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** That was just him eating Skittles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Let's see.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** How deep are we?

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** How deep do we want to go with this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** How smart is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Yeah, I think the Kasothan thing is a lie.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** I don't think he's killed that many Kasothans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:41]** I think he does think of art as art because I think that Thaddeus, there's an art to his killing and dressing animals.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** That's a spiritual thing for him.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** So I don't think he's killed that many Kasothans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:53]** I like that Rolo is like kind of standing back at the snack table when this conversation is going on.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** And Thaddeus is like, I've killed more Cthothams than anything else.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** And I feel like he just goes and kind of spits out his drink or whatever he's chewing.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Yeah.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Just like a what?

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** What?

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** It gives him an evil stare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Thaddeus is staring daggers at Rolo the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** Yeah.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** Just like chewing slowly as he's staring at Rolo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** Just like sharp cat eyes.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:25]** And then as he eats his Skittles, they just get like really like circular like irises or whatever the hell.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I don't know anything about cats.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** I need to own a cat someday.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** All right.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Okay.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** So.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Wait.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** What about Torme?

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Hold on.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** Torme thinks that he's not really a Taur.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** That's right.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:48]** All right, so now that we've gone through those and we gave it some time for the viewer to kind of decide what they think it is, now's your turn.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:52]** Can you tell us which ones were the truth and which one was the lie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:59]** Okay, so it is true that Thaddeus is a little bit threatened by Rolu's bulk.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** Sorry, is this Kelly or is this Thaddeus?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Oh, I'm sorry.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Yeah, I want to hear some Thaddeus's voice.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Whatever.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** You started it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** I take pride in my workouts, my pre-workout, my post-workout, and so on.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:17]** And I'm a little, uh, threatened with a role who can just, seems to gain muscle so easily.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** So that's like, that's the truth.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:28]** Um, you know, I, I also actually have killed more Kasathans than any other race, but not because of my individual assassinations.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:33]** I once fought in a campaign where I had to fight against Kasathans, a whole army of them.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** And so that actually is my highest kill count of species.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** And I actually don't care about his art.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** I think it's terrible.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** I was right.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** You can't just draw stars, Rolloo, and expect everyone to think that they're great.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** They're stars, Rolloo.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:58]** You can't even mix it up with a galaxy or a black hole or anything like that every now and again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:01]** We tired as doodles too, but I won't say it.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** Can I get back to work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** I just want to leave.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** I want to go.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Can I leave now?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Am I done?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** I love it.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Take your boy, Skittles.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** I didn't get any Skittles.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** I'll see you later.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Goodbye.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** I'm leaving now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** I just love that it's a documentary that's happening on the ship.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** It's kind of just set up in a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** I'm taking the Skittles, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Thanks.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** Anyways, cool.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Thank you so much for that.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Wow.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** Are you guys ready to play?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Yeah.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** I almost forgot.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Go ahead and hit the little button.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** What button?

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:52]** Starfinder Storytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Starfinder Storytime.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Yeah.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Yeah.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** So amazing.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:54]** Thank you.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Starfinder Storytime is fun.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Thanks to the seven kids.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Let's hear the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** Let's hear the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Xeno Wardens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Ah, yeah.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:17]** So I have weirdly always been like fascinated with the Xeno Wardens because in the same way that I'm like fascinated with the stewards, because they just, they operate in kind of a gray area.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:23]** The Xeno Wardens are like a druidic order founded on Castroville.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:27]** We talked about them last time in regards to Rolu's backstory and,

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:36]** And they're really like, they basically are like, a lot of different types of people come under their banner.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:52]** And their purpose is to help protect the natural environment and the exploration of worlds and the sanctity of the wilds that are in the packed worlds, near space, and beyond.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:59]** Some of them, you can think of them as like zealots, right?

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:10]** These environmentalist warriors who are willing to lay down their lives to force civilization to live in harmony with fragile ecosystems.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:17]** Some of them are mystics channeling nature magic.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:21]** They are not above conflict.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** And I would say that

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:30]** The most well-known, I think, are the elite units of the Green Guards and the Wild Knights.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:39]** They're lethal in terms of starfighters and this biological powered armor that they have.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:46]** And what I like is that their philosophy involves a lot of research and understanding of civilization.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:52]** So they actually rival the Brithidans in their knowledge and use of biotech.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** So for instance, they grow their starships.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Their starships are like living organisms.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** that they can use, which is pretty remarkable.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:15]** And they basically can take a lot of what they understand about the world and then apply it even in their political power, right?

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** So they understand that civilization is a step in the evolution of nature.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:32]** So they can be very powerfully wielded depending on which faction they ally with.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:42]** One thing that I want to add that I think really embodies their sense of both adventure and exploration and also their devoutness

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:51]** commitment to the wildlife is that their leader, right, is called the green speaker.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:59]** And the green speaker is chosen, right, chosen from among the captains.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:12]** And what they do is when you're chosen, you're dropped for a year without any gear on some inhabitable but completely wild and unexplored planet.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:21]** And if you survive for a year without significantly harming the ecosystem, then you can step into the role of green speaker.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** So that's how they choose their leaders.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:27]** I think that's really emblematic of their stance.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:32]** So again, this gray area, they are both like protectors,

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:43]** the rangers of the universe, but then depending on what you do, they can be pretty aggressive in metering out justice to anybody who doesn't

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** who impacts the ecosystem.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:51]** Anyway, that is Starfinder Storytime about the Xeno Wardens.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** Haven't seen a lot of them in APs.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** Not that I've read every AP, but I would love to see more of them as a faction in Adventures.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** They're pretty neat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** As the GM, I'll take that into account.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Let me write that down on the side.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** I'll see if they can get the Xeno Wardens to appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** At the last step.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** In Kefauk Depot.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:17]** They don't like the illegal dumping that Riddle's been doing.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** A couple of Xeno Wardens knock on their door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** Turns out the Kefauks are actually like an endangered species.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** You guys are all under the bus.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** You guys are just spoiling everything.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:31]** I'm sorry.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Cool.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Thank you for that, John.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I appreciate it.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:40]** Also, thank you to Odin and Finn for lending us their beautiful voices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** Oh, and if you want to know more, you should also check out Maple Table.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** Good video on the Xeno Wardens.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Classic resource.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** You should make videos, John.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** That was really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I learned a lot of lore from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** Thanks.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Thank you.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** All right.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Anything else before we play?

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** Anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** I've turned off the music, so it's the anything time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Anything.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Absolutely anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Dramatic pause.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Here we go!

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Cool.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** All right, let's play.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Just a brief rundown.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** Last time, you guys started off right at these two ziggurats of rubble.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:21]** Thaddeus points out that they're actually K'vok nests and to be very stealthy.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** Rolu, smooth like butter, slips right up past that first cigarette, kind of in between the two.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** But while he's doing that, Chuck is freaking out.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:37]** He's clenching to Rolu's head, and he's pointing and screaming about how he sees one of these things coming out from the junk.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:59]** and that that actually alerts the entire hive fox as they come charging at you they focused on chuck and rolu you know because you guys are stacked on top of each other we've talked about some of that with our our paralegals thank you um and so they they actually quickly overwhelm the two of you specifically rolu taking him down to just one hp

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:04]** He takes a guarded step back, and then as he does so, you guys all start taking pop shots at these things.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** One at a time.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Boom, boom, boom.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** Successful hits, taking them out each time you shoot.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:15]** And so out of the four that came out, you only have one to go.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** Yes.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Except... Who is blinded.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Who is blinded and prone.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Except...

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:28]** There was one more that came bursting out of the nest, charging right for Rolo.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** And let me take you over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:34]** And went through a threatened square by both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Yes!

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** We're talking about it.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** Mr. Forgetful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:45]** I just wanted to see if you ended the episode right there, just so that wouldn't restart this one.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** False.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Here's a question.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Do you have a melee weapon out?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:54]** I do, because I'm four-armed, my friend.

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:01]** Oh, you almost called me a mean name, didn't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:05]** So I was like, oh, this is crossing Thaddeus' square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** That too.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** It's crossing both of ours, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** But Thaddeus does not have a melee weapon now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** No.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** You can only take attacks of opportunity if you have melee weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** Unless you have improved unarmed strike.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** I think I do have that.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Really?

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** That would make sense, actually.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Unarmed strike.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Yeah, because you've got claws, doesn't he?

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Yeah.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** I don't have claw improved.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** I have unarmed strike, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** It's a feat.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Yeah.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Oh, a feat?

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** I mean, if you took that as your feat at first level...

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** It just says under melee unarmed strike.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** That doesn't count.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** No, I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:50]** It's actually a feat that says improved strike allows you to do non... I forget exactly how it works, but you can do an unarmed strike even if you're holding a two-handed weapon.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Nice.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Gotcha.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:56]** Yeah, you're able to kick or hit with the butt of your gun.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Hit the butt.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** But I think you had a great point, Will.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:04]** It is also passing through the corner section from Treme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:11]** So go ahead and do... I'll take a swing at this beast.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Yes.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** Does a 16 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Sorry, yes.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Yes, it does.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** As I choke on my rum.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:23]** Yeah, no, let me... I'm not even on my initiative tracker, and yeah, I know that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:27]** So... Max damage, four points.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Max...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Oh.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Got him.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Shift.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** Did you?

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** So this thing gets hit as you stab it, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** No, I swing at it with my battle staff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** All right.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** So you definitely bash the side of this thing and kind of catch it just a little bit.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:50]** And it definitely looks hurt, but it continues to move towards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** Can you continue to move if you get hit with an AOA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** I don't know, man.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Read the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** I think so.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** No.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** I'm looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** I think it stops a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** I think not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** And it's as you move out of the day.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** So he already moved out of the threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** Yeah, but it happens before the attack that triggers them.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** So it happens before you move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Okay.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** All right.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Read it, John.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Tell me what you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:18]** No, I'm just saying attacks or opportunities are always resolved before the action that triggers them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Right.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** So the attack has been resolved.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Now he can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:45]** oh okay so you need a feat there's a feat called standstill and that's the only thing that would stop a movement right it's that's a feat that the player has yeah so i don't have cool okay yeah so you can move sweet thank you which is different from like spell casting right so like if you're trying to cast a spell and you get hit by an aol it interrupts the spell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:52]** Unless... Sorry, it's also summer, and I have bug bites all over my legs because my son made me push him in a swing while I was just wearing flip-flops.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** So I keep scratching my legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** Did you get attacked by K'Fox?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Yep, tiny little K'Fox.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Bye-bye.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** What?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** So, four points of damage.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Four points of damage.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:11]** This thing is still up, and it finishes its move action to get right in front of your face, Rolu, and it's going to swing at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Good luck.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Why is it after Rolo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** Because that's the one that alerted them.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** Well, it's Choc that alerted them, but he... I just smacked it.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:26]** Yeah, but it can't change its perspective while you... It's up to you, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** I don't know.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** It's all good.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** If you're after Rolo, you're after Rolo.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** If you're vicious, you're vicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:31]** It's fine.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:35]** I rolled an eight on the dice with a plus four.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** That's 12 to hit, KAC.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Don't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Got him.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Nice.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** You better come correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:51]** So you knocked it off course just enough that it slices at Rolu's foot and completely misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Yeah.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** You better be serious when you come at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** And now, Termay, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Uh, yes.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Well, thank you.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** I suppose this beast needs to be put down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:10]** And he's going to try and take a shot at it again.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:17]** I would say if I miss critically, then I could either shoot Rolu or Chak.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** So let's hope that doesn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Or Thaddeus, really.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Yeah, fair.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** I love how, like, neutral Torme is.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Holy shit.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** No way.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** You spoke into existence.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Oh, my God.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Natural one.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** Yeah.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Oh, no.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Kevin, what are the odds?

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** I feel like it's a percentile dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** I literally spoke it into existence.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** I shouldn't have done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Kev, what's the GM rule?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:53]** Do we do a critical fail deck, or do you want to say, like, I accidentally shoot one of my teammates?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** No, I think you should do critical.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** What's the question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Okay.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Critical fumble.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:07]** The question was a critical fumble deck or... Do you want to do a percent die for me hitting a bystander?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** Yeah, like he hits me or Jack because he's shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:14]** I mean, theoretically, too, I could miss.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:18]** I mean, it's in the line of the sight of the prone creature.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Yeah, I'm going to say we should do the deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Okay, deck.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** Okay, deck it.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:32]** So for the listener, Torme is at the bottom right corner, and the K'fok's right in front of me, and he missed.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Okay, critical fumble deck.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** It's a ranged weapon, right?

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:35]** Yes.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** So I'm going to do this.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Ready?

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Let me know.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Three, two, one.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Stop.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Wait, no.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Not that one.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** No, I just had it upside down.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** I didn't even read it.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Oh, redo it.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Is it, sorry, is it kinetic or energy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** It's an energy.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Energy.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Oh, no.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** I think it's a projectile.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** That's a kinetic.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Yeah.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** Should it make that noise?

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** That's the name of this.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** That's great.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:27]** Your weapon deals damage equal to its item level to anyone who attacks with it until the weapon is repaired with a successful engineering check.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Does it deal damage to me right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** I think so.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:36]** Yeah.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Okay.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** What?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** It's probably item level.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** I'm sure it's level one.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** One or two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Yeah, it's item level one.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Yeah.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Okay.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Yeah.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** It's a one-handed small arm projectile.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Yeah.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** So what happens?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** How much damage can it do?

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** How much damage does it do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** It does.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** It's 1d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Do you want me to roll or do you want to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** It does damage equal to its item level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Oh, so it does one damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Just one damage.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Each time that you attack with it, it will do one damage.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** It doesn't say it doesn't... Well, I guess it does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** I mean, the one says it doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** But it says every time you use it, it'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Every time you use it or every time it hits?

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Every time you use it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Until it's repaired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** So it still doesn't... You can continue to use it.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** It'll still do a roll.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** It's still a roll and attack, roll and attack.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** But every time you do that, you take one point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:50]** yeah so I take one point of damage now basically you just got what is it called when it viper pinches your oh yeah the recoil the slide bite whatever yeah you pull the trigger and it just kind of clips your thumb so I'm down one point in stamina yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Fine.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Great.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:56]** I think this thing might need some repair.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:10]** Well, with that, we're going to move on to K'vok number four, who is blinded and prone.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Let's see how well this goes.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** So he's going to use his move.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** It's a they because it's, I don't know, the sex of this creature.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** Gender.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:25]** They are going to stand up using their move action, right?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** Okay.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Because that's how you get out of being prone.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** So let me figure out how to turn that off.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** They are going to then move forward.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Oh, wait.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Did we roll for how many rounds it was blinded?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** It was 1D3, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** No, we didn't.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Did you want to roll a D3?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Yeah.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Well, you critically failed, so you would roll.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Just roll a D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** I did.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** I rolled a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** So it's three rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** It'd be two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** It'd be three.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** It'd be three.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** One, two is one.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Three, four is two.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Five, six is three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** All right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** It'd actually be five rounds because of how you round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Yep.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Well, it then moved forward to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Second round.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** And that's its turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Right?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** Because that's entire move economy for this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Yeah.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Stand up and then move.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** Ambling over blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** And with that, it is now Rolu's turn at the bottom of the second round.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:16]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** Well, then, you're positively cornered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** I'm positively, I'm literally cornered.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** We're back against a building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** Oh, yeah, so let's describe it to the listener real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:31]** Wait, I thought it was for three rounds that this guy was blinded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** He's still blind, yeah.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** Or they are still blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** Oh, when you're blind, you do to move.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Yeah, don't you have, like, a missed chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** No, to attack, there was a concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** No, wait, hold on.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:48]** You must succeed at a DC 10 acrobatics check to move faster than half your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Oh, I definitely moved at least half.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** You can move five feet.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Moved up.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** You were explaining the situation, Kev?

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** But you were knocked prone, too.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** He got up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:02]** Yeah, I used a move action to stand up, and then a move action to move forward, so it is not attacking.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** It can attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Yeah.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** What was I saying?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** I forget.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** You were explaining the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:14]** So you guys came off of this bridge over the ooze.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:19]** There's the two ziggurats kind of off into the top right corner, one and the other.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:26]** Rolu was being attacked first and stepped backwards against a corner kind of.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:34]** So there's three sides now of Rolu is backed by basically a giant wall of junk.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** And then the two Kafaks that are alive moved in from each side.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** So now there's a Kafak in front and a Kafak to the side of Rolu.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Basically completely cornered.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:48]** But just according to the rules, not flanked.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** So Rolu, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** All right.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:59]** I think Rolu is going to take his tactical spear.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** And he's going to stab at the one to his right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** Fair reminder, before you go any further, you could do some actions like fight defensively or full defense.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Oh, good point, good point.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** If you're feeling to do so, because I know you were at death's door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** No, I am going to... Knock, knock, knocking on death's door.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** Knock, knock, knocking, knocking on death's door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** I am going to fight defensively, because why not?

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** I always like this kind of stuff.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Finds me another round.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** I love it.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Yeah.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** Wait, what?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Nothing.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Okay.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Okay, you fight defensively.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:41]** You take a minus four penalty to attacks and gain a plus two bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** So I'm going to get a minus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** Is that a full action to do that?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:51]** You can do a full action of fight defensively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:54]** Oh, actually, yeah, I'm going to do that, and I'm going to make two attacks.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Nice.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** Actually, I'm not.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Well, that's a minus eight.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Okay.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:08]** Yeah, I'm going to do a full action fight defensively, so it's a minus four to the minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** So fight defensively is just a modifier to the way that you're fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Yes.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** And then I'll get a plus two.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** So I'll make two attacks against this one next to me.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** I'm trying to think of what he does to, like, fight defensively.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** I feel like he kind of, like, tries to, like, elbow back a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Prop himself in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:33]** Yeah, like, try to, like, make kind of a space for myself where I could, like, move or, like, maybe push a little bit of junk in to block an attack, just like his flavor.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** First attack, Raven and Riddle.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Don't...

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Leave me hanging.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:47]** What is with this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** We haven't had a critical fumble for so long.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** And now we've had two in the same combat.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Two in the same combat.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** One last week.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** All right.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** I guess we're doing the crit fumble deck.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Let's do it.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** I'm going to stop myself.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:07]** There we go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** Kinetic attack, just a flesh wound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** Oh my God, you're going to knock yourself unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** Apply the wound critical hit effect to yourself.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Roll on table 7-1.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** That's core rule book 183.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:32]** Wounding weapons and suffer the listed effect.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Fortitude negates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** All right, I have table 7-11 up.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** That's what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Yeah.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** And I got to roll a fortitude save to see if I pass.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Okay.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** What do we say the DC was?

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, this is bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** This table is metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Do you roll DC?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** You just roll a D20.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** And then I'll read off what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** No, no, no.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** It says fortitude negates.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** So I'm just rolling DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:02]** So if he passes a fortitude save, but we don't know what the DC is.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:11]** It says the save DC for an effect triggered by a PC is equal to 10 plus one half the level of the attack.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** The level of the attack.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:19]** The item level for weapon attacks, which a tactical spear item.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** It's got to be level one.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Probably.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** If you click on it on Hero Lab, it pops up.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:48]** thank you yes it is one good call so dc of 11 you said 10 plus one half so it's 11 wait oh shoot plus the pc's kill key ability score oh no oh dude you're gonna be like dc 14 this is like yeah 14 because i because i think for uh yeah key ability score i think it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** I'm so scared for Rolu right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** This is going so well for you guys last time.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** It really was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Also, isn't it one half per item level?

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** So it would actually still be 10 because then it would be 10.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** So it's probably 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Is there no minimum one?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Okay.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** I'm done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** Well, the minimum is 10.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I'll give you 10 on that.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** But what were you saying about the key abilities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** So it's plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Total of 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Score or modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** You could beat a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:24]** No.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** It's got to be the modifier.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** That would be crazy.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Yeah.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** That would be crazy.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** The key ability score is the... It does say score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** I mean, 13 seems reasonable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** That would make it a 20-something.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** Right.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Yeah, that would be crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Okay.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** Let me just double check my fortitude.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Let's call it a DC 13.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Roll your fort.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** Good thing I have a healthy plus zero fortitude save.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** So I'm not that swole with Edeus.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** I don't know.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:59]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Oh, John.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Please don't tell me you rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** It was 13.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** I rolled a 12.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** No!

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:40]** roll another d20 let's find out exactly how all right i'm not even i'm not even looking at the table uh i wouldn't i've got the table up and ready i'm looking at it oh man oh man oh man this is bad dude one of them is lost an eye seven okay that's that's not bad bleed it's general damage uh or general wound and you bleed one d6


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:41 - 00:43:10]** bleed 1d6 so either way I'm you're down you're continuously bleeding 1d6 right so like you you bleed until you're healed yeah okay so like you could have lost an arm yeah or an eye or a leg really oh my god yeah all right so I kind of you got a natural 20 is the brain where you're just stunned I did roll a six ouch so I take this damage right now so I I hit myself and now I'm bleeding


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** And you already bleed.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:17]** And so maybe you were hit a little harder than you thought.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** And it actually has nothing to do with the weapon attack.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:23]** And you're thinking real hard about hitting these things.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** And as you go to swing at them, you just faint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:36]** It's really... I'm going to put a big red X over... I'm not feeling it.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Oh, man.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:41]** I was going to try and flank this guy, and now I can't.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Oh, wait.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Chuck's still there.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Chuck's still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Speaking of which, back to mounting rules.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Rollu just fell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** So, Chuck, go ahead and roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Dexterity save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Yeah, what's the DC going to be for that?

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** You want to say 11?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:01]** It's a whole argument about your level ones and one and a half times your level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** It's a cool 17.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** All right, so you're fine.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:11]** Like, Rolloose kind of gets a little woozy and just kind of tumbles to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:16]** I, like, jump up as he's falling, and then when he hits the ground, I land on his chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** I feel like, like, you don't even, like, have to jump.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:24]** Like, he drops out from underneath you, and, like, your leaf vines kind of just, like, instantly grab.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Can I?

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:32]** I also have, like, an ability where I can just, like, float to the ground.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Oh, that's neat.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** Aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** Yeah.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** That's kind of cool.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** That's very nice.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Can I say this one?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Like a leaf on the wind.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Like a candle leaf.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Like a candle leaf.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** This is my first time going down as a PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** When you wake back up, you can ask Thaddeus.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** You can tell Thaddeus about how much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:56]** Here's a question, and this may be for us, it may be for the firm.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Bleeding status...

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** Bleeding condition, you take that damage for each round.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** If you're already unconscious... Well, I just fell unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:12]** So next round, if I was unconscious and I wasn't healed... Yeah, but I think that's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** Do you continue to take it, and at what point... Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Do you lose a death saving throw?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Well, there's no death saving throw.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** I would probably lose a resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:24]** I'm trying to look right now to see... If you take damage after you're unconscious, what happens?

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Bleeding for each round...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:35]** Your bleed can be stopped with a successful DC 15 medicine check as a standard action, or through the application of any ability that restores hit points.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** So you will likely be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:45]** Well, Chalk, you already had, you dropped your weapon to pull out your healing serum, and that will heal your HP, so that will stop the bleeding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** so I'm going to stick you at the top of next round, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:55]** But just for fun, what happens if you do take damage while you're unconscious in Starfire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:02]** Well, you would use a resolve point to be stabilized, so you'd then be hit while unstable, or be hit while stabilized.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** I think it would put you back in a dying situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** So you'd effectively lose a resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** If I was stable, yeah, then I would be unstable.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** What happens if you lose all your resolve points?

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** You just die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** You're dead, Dad.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** You dead?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** You can f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:18]** John, look into that while we move on.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:22]** Okay, so Rolu is down on the ground, unconscious and bleeding.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** And that is the end of round two.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** Let's go back to the top of round.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** Now we're going to go back to the top of our initiative order with round number three.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** And sorry to make things worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:40]** I swear to God, Kevin, if you pull out another kafak, like, I'm going to be so pissed.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** You should have just shown them all at once.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** I mean, actually, from a tactic standpoint, that's not good, but still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Wait, copy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Copy, paste, bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** This is the fight that never ends.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** That's an eight plus.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Oh, I don't even have to copy and paste.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:01]** I'll just bring this one back alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** I think the question at this point is how many?

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** I know.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** Do we need to burn down these layers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** What did I just do?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** I just broke everything.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Just light the cigarettes.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** That worked.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Okay.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** So now I'll change this to a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** I actually kind of like that plan.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Are these things, like, flammable?

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** Are they made of metal or paper or what?

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Yeah, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** I feel like... Paper mache?

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** These guys are paper mache, right?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Kevin, I have a question.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:34]** Like, this is a preset amount of enemies that the book provides you, or do you have some control over the amount of enemies that are provided?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:38]** Or I should say they go... Make sure you write that question down, and we'll talk about it during class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** I'm curious, because I have a feeling it may be the latter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:46]** Uh, so as the round ends, Rolu is on the ground.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:53]** Um, and you guys actually see another K'vok kind of burrowing up out of this hive on the hive past you guys.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Um, and so you see it on the corner there.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:02]** It's on the corner nearest you, but on the further of the two pyramids.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** And that's up there.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** And I just applied it.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:05]** It's order.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** I'm going to call this one K'fok number six.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Of 20.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Six of 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Six of nine.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Six of nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Love it.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** K'fok number four is still alive.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Also dying and dead.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** K'fok five is still up.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** All right.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** I think I'm ready to move on.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:26]** Chalk, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Cool.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** I'm going to retcon this a little bit.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** So Roloo falls.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** Chalk extends his flowers so he floats.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:43]** While he's floating down, he preps the serum in hand so that when he lands on Roloo, it just injects right into his chest.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** Ah!

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** It goes down like a stabbing action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** It's like Link in Slow Motion.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** And that's full healing.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Eight hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Nice.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** That's what I like to see.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Wow.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Wow.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** It's just like an adrenaline shot to the chest.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** What movie was that?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Pulp Fiction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** Yeah.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** So eight hit points, right?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** Yep.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Dang.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:40]** cool is that your whole turn that is that's it yeah i guess that's a move in a standard action was it oh because it's standard to apply and move to move to not not get clobbered by your falling body yeah yeah yeah i'll give that to you wait is it or was that my move action from last round your move was to stay on um but is it what is the action to to land what was you saying what does it read as my my words are getting stung as a like a like a dexterity check

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** What does the L fan give you?

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:52]** So that's a plant-like ability, flowering.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:58]** DC 15 acrobatics check to negate falling damage when in an atmosphere.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** So, like, I don't know that I would have taken falling damage anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Yeah, I will say you didn't take falling action.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** I'm going to just give that to you.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** For free?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** And that is the end of your turn.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** You land and stab him, give him the eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** That is the end of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Can I reserve a move action to stay on his shoulder when he stands up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:21]** Yeah, your next turn is to choose whether or not you use that move action until we decide on better rules.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** All right.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** Kefauk number two is dead.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** So Thaddeus, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:31]** Could you X out this Kefauk, please?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** I like to see it happen.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** The number two that just died.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** Kefauk 2 has been dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Why would you say that again?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** We already mentioned that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Because I'm going back through my initiative order.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** I marked it in red.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** The person is dead.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** I'm just letting you know that it would be their turn.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** It's no longer their turn.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** That's good.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** They're no longer alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** All right.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** It makes sense.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** I got you.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** All right.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:53]** Thaddeus is going to take a guarded step five feet this direction.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** And then he's going to shoot this guy back.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** So here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** Shirking away from a fight, whips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** It's called a tactical retreat.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** And then he only rolls a nine, though.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** A nine total?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** You can make fun of me for that.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Yeah, that's just a nine to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** A tactical failure, you mean?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:22]** Are you really questioning me in the middle of combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** I'm just remarking on your strategy.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Oh, really?

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Okay, good.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** It's called tactics, not strategy.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** Know your place and get in the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** Hey, hey, hey, Webbs, if you pointed at the kafak, it works better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:40]** I will not have this insubordination.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** The cob just went down.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Assist him.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** I recommend flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** That's what I was going to do.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** I said that like four turns ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** I go down.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Chaos ensues.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** You could have flanked him too, you know.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:03]** He says, I'm fine.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:14]** Okay, so it is now K'vok number five, which is the one that broke out of the Hive and dove at you last time.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** It is now their turn.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:21]** I just need to clarify, Rolu, you are prone, and you dropped your weapons.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Is that correct?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Just double-check following rules.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** I think we were called out on that on Discord last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Yep, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:34]** So given that situation, Rolu on the ground, Chalk now standing on top of him,

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:42]** Um, Kvok number five is going to attack twice against Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Oh, Chuck.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Which one's five?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** The blinded one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** The one to the right without being blinded.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Uh, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Do you want to hit him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** I won't.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** You don't.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Oh, man.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** I keep doing that.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** That's an eight plus four minus five for seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Nope.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Try again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** And that doesn't hit either.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:05]** So this thing... Is it a critical one?

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** No, it's not.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:16]** As you're coming down with that healing serum into his chest, this thing is just like slashing out at the leaves that are coming and misses both times.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** And now we'll move on to Torme's turn.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Yes.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:29]** Well, this guy's going to need some help after this one.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** So he's going to step up.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** And say to Wepps, this is how it's done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** I swear, this shouldn't be happening.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:45]** Terme, you shouldn't be doing this in the middle of combat.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** It's on the Wepps.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** You can't do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:48]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Go ahead.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Nice.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** On my melee.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** So you're also flanking.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Yeah.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** So it doesn't matter.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:02]** You're hitting K'fok number five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:06]** And it's flanked by myself and Choc, since Rollo's still down, right?

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Yeah, Rollo's still down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Does it count?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Yeah.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** No.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:13]** Rollo's up, but he's prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** You're alive, but you're down on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Yes, that's true.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Can you flank while prone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** You don't need him to flank.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Choc is blank.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Choc is there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** It gives you a plus two.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You got a natural 20.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** You definitely hit.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Go ahead.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Roll twice.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Give us your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** I'm just curious what your minimum damage is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:39]** My minimum would be two, but... Because you have no bonuses?

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** No, not for this weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Okay, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Okay.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Five points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Five points of damage.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Oh, man.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:51]** I wish that was just a little bit more for you guys.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** I'm pulling for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Are you?

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** I am.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** This already had nine points then.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** This guy.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** Because I got the A-O-O on him for four points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** Oh, you are right.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** That is five.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Didn't apply the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** No, I put it to the wrong one.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** It's okay.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** So that one.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** I've done that.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Good call.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** Five points of damage is enough to kill it.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Take notes, webs.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:28]** You're going to get a lashing later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:41]** So I think you kind of just take a note from Chak as he puts in the healing serum, and you do the exact same thing with your spear, your staff, and just pin this thing to the ground, and there's just enough of a healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Smash its head under the hilt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** And this thing is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:51]** Let me put a big red X over that one.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** And six more pop up.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** It is now.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** That was TremÃ©'s turn.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:05]** It is, in fact, Cathak number six's turn, which is the one that came out of the edge there.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:15]** And that one is going to go after one, two, three.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** It's going to go after Treme.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Makes sense.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** And that's its move.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** That's its attack.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:25]** It rolls a nine on KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:28]** I'm sorry, but that's going to be a big miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** It just casually talks to it.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** Yeah, I'm sorry, but you missed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:36]** And that's the end of that K'fok's turn.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** It is now K'fok number four's turn.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** This thing is blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Yes.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** For the third round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** No, it's got at least two more rounds, right?

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** Of blindness?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** No, this is the second round that it's blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:55]** It was blinded on the first round.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** We're in round three.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** So second, yeah.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** You're right, you're right, you're right.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:08]** Okay, so K'vok number four is going to swing to attack.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** with a full attack or not a full attack, just a one solid attack.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** So it doesn't take the minus four bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** So you're going to have a 50% mischance though.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Okay.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Is there anything else blind wise that happens?

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** I forget all sorts of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:27]** I, I think for the purpose of you just attacking, it's just the 50% mischance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Okay.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** And this is a attacking chalk.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Uh, should have, should have attacked me.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Well, you're still on the ground.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** You don't count.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** It's a 9 plus 4 for a 13 to hit.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:47]** But before you tell us whether or not that hits, I need to roll this one.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** An 80.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Yeah.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** It hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** I don't know if it hits.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** It's a miss?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** It's got to be a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** It's anything over 50, you said?


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** That's usually how we roll it.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** It's a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** Okay, so 13 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Yeah, that would hit if it was energy.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** But it's not, so you miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** It's not energy, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** Hey, got him.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** You had me in the first half, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** This thing swings and hits, or swings and misses.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** There are two of these up.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Rolu, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:28]** I hate that this other one moved in because I was going to take advantage of the fact that that one was blind and couldn't take an AOL.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** Can I just tell you guys something real quick?

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** When you're down, I just found this out.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** This took a little bit of digging.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:38]** When you're down, the first time that...

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** Any damage you take reduces your stamina points if you still have it, right?

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** So if you still have stamina points, when you go down, the damage reduces that.

**[00:58:48 - 00:59:02]** Once you are at zero stamina points, the first time each round that you are dying and you take hit point damage from an attack or something like a bleed effect, it literally says that, you will lose a resolve point.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:16]** At any other point in that round that you take more hit point damage, if that hit point damage is greater than half of your max HP, you lose another RP.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:22]** If it is equal to or greater than your maximum HP, you die.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** Instantaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Instantaneously.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Really?

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** No matter how many resolve points you have?

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Impressive.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** So at low levels, when we're at low HP.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** So you would need to take what, how many hit points do you have?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Like nine, eight?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** I have nine.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:45]** So if I was at zero, then the first time that one of them hit me, I would be, I would lose a resolve.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:53]** But then if the second or N attack crits you, then yeah, then you're toast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:56]** I mean, even with that bleed effect, because it was a D6.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Even with the bleed effect.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:06]** If you were to take four, five, or six, so you basically had a 33% chance of just instant dying from bleeding out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** You might, yeah.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Well, it's the second, yeah.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Yeah, it's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** That is good to know for sure.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** And it's my turn.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:20]** And I was going to try and cast a spell, but I'm not going to occur an AOL because I... Well, can you attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** So you are prone.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** You're prone with no weapons, right?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:30]** Yeah, I could cast a spell, but then I incur an AOL from the... You could cast a spell from prone, is what you're saying?

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]** Unless someone out there wants to fight me on it.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:39]** But I think what's going to happen is I'm going to stand up, and I can only pick up one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:44]** I'm not trying to metagame too hard, but you could also just pick up a weapon while prone and then attack from prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** That's true.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** It's a minus four for a melee attack.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** You could pick up Chuck's miniature rifle.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Oh, my God.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Pick up a mini pistol.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Sure.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:59]** I like the idea that Rolu is...

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:10]** So he's going to... One of his hands is going to reach over and find the tactical spear and going to make an attack against number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Number two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Which one is number two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:18]** We have four and six now.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** The one that's in the middle.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** You're talking about the one that's not blinded?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Actually, you know what?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:25]** The one that's blinded because they're on my side.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** So I'm going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:32]** Okay, and they are also flat-footed, so they take a minus two to AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** Yep, and I have a minus four to my roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Okay.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** It's a race to the bottom.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** You're attacking the crippled one while the... Cool.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Oh, man.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** I got a six.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** There's no way.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:45]** Unless.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:46]** Is there a way?

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Is there a way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** No, there's no way, but I'm just glad it's not natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Dude, if I rolled another natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** All right.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** All right.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** That is the end of round number three.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Sorry for dragging this out so much.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** You know, you're kind of fighting an entire hive of K'Fox.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** I'm going to change that counter to four and move on to Chuck.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** Oh, goodness gracious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** Am I saying that right?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** It's Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** Chuck.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** Chuck.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** Chuck.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** Chuck.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]** I think I've changed that vowel sound over time.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** I'm sorry, listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Thank you, Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** You're welcome.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:20]** You're welcome, Cobb.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:32]** Uh, he drops the empty vial, picks up his miniature long rifle, and gives the blinded Kefak whatever the Raxalite version of the finger is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** So that's your whole turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:39]** Yeah, I mean, it's a standard action to pick up my rifle, and I can't fire it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Is it?

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:44]** It's a free action to, well, no, you're already expended your... Oh, wait, it's only a move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** It's only a move action to pick up.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Oh, awesome.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Yeah.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** I'm going to start blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Do you incur an AOO from the one in the center?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Shut up, John.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** I incur an AOO from both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** No, not from the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** It's flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** It doesn't get in.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Oh.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** It's flat-footed.

**[01:02:59 - 01:02:59]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** But you do incur from K'vok number five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** That's fine.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:03]** Roll it up.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** You haven't hit me yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** Does he have soft cover from me?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:07]** No.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Shut up.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** That's so rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Why does he hide behind his neck or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:15]** There's so much adding on top of your proud body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** Don't you ever tell me cover again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:21]** Cover no longer exists in this game.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:24]** That is 17 to hit.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** You had to come better than that.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** He had you.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** Sucks, don't it, Kev?

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:36]** Yes, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]** I'm going to have to review your armor, too, Kelly.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** Let's give Kevin a taste of his own medicine.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** Kevin, all of a sudden, some more pirates drop down from our ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Back up.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Cool.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Okay, so this thing misses.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** 17 hits.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** 17 absolutely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** Oh, it does?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Oh, okay.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:56]** Jesus.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** That is six points of damage.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Welcome to the jungle.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:05]** That's as high as I can go.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** Wait, how much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** That hurts.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:07]** Six.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Six points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:15]** You don't lose your attack, though, right?

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** It's only a spell that is just a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:18]** As far as I know.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** Cool.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:25]** I'm going to fire at the non-blinded one.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** Let's see what happens.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:32]** That's an 18 to hit.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** It hits.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Cool.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** For seven projectile damage.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Piercing damage, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** Okay.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:46]** Yeah, this thing, like, it swings at you, and you kind of like, woo-hoo-hoo, and dodge it a little bit.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:54]** And then you point, you just kind of stick the muzzle right to its forehead and pull the trigger, and that thing just falls over backwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Dude.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:57]** That one is dead.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** That's so, like, Chucky.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** That was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:07]** And just real quick, there's only one K'vok left.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** And it's blind.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** It is blinded, weak.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]** I'm going to actually take us out of initiative for just a bit.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Mind you, this is still a live nest.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** These things are swarming.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** So I'll leave that to you.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** What do you want to do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Chuck wants to GTFO, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** Yes, I think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:37]** So we can get past this guy without him noticing and leave combat, basically, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]** He is, it is flat-footed.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** It has no AOOs.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:45]** There are no other K'Vox currently in your field of view.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** So we're good to go.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:47]** We can just leave.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Let's do it.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** I say, good job, everyone.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Let's get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Another one of those tactical retreats, whips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:01]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:05]** It's interesting that you were the furthest away during this fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:14]** Termadin's going to creep up to the edge of the sort of...

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** The ziggurat field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:19]** Let's stealthily make our escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:26]** I just want to point out, while you guys are talking about where you're moving, I was like, well, I'm going to start rolling dice to see if any more fox pop up.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:33]** I set the marker myself about where it would be, and I rolled a natural 20.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** No.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Luckily, I set it to be one.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** So no more Kvass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** All right.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:46]** How do you want us to... Yeah, so Tormadin just moved.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** Can we just... Should we put ourselves where we want to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** Yeah, go ahead and move yourselves.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:56]** I'm just going to say, like, this is... You guys are... You just finished this combat.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:56]** You guys are moving on.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** You guys make it to the end.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** You turn around this corner and get away from these nests.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Yes, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** These ziggurats, what are they made of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:32]** metal they are their chassis yeah we can't burn it okay cool cool cool cool cool yeah there's uh um i wanted to ask i have the ability as a cantrip to cast mending to repair my uh pistol that's cool let's let's worry about that in a bit um so everybody now has rather than an engineering check unless somebody wants to help me out with my sidearm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:35]** Is there anybody else hurt?

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** Looks like your pistol's hurt.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:39]** I can help you with repairing that for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:44]** So you guys get up around the corner from these two ziggurats, right?

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** And there's a little bit of an opening.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** I'm actually going to highlight.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** Let's see if I can do this.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** Move you guys just a little further in.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** So you're now out of the clearing.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** These K'foks in their nests no longer can see you.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** You guys start settling in a little bit.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** Try to relax from that fight.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** But you guys get a message.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:05]** Well, I'll say Treme gets a message.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:10]** His phone, his wrist device beeps a little bit.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** And you look down at it.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:17]** It says, you can read the message.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** And it says, Hey, YRC, it's Harden from radio.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** I've sent all of Rolo's messages on and off.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** I organized them for you.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:29]** Looks like he contacted 46 people and 40 of them were on the Knave's Revenge campaign.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:39]** Majority of the messages were to and from a She-Ra and one other person, but this one was really the most suspicious.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** And that's the message you see.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** And there is an attachment.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:54]** I view the attachment, but I want to keep it from Rolu's eyes, so maybe I'll just...

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:02]** While Rolu is perhaps looking at my weapon, I'm going to nudge over to the weps.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]** Be like, thanks, Rolu, for taking a look at that.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:17]** I'm not going to show weps right away, but I definitely want to use him kind of like concealment to show that I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** So do me a favor.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** I want you to roll stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** Okay.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:28]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** Okay.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:34]** We'll worry about what the others see in a bit.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** You hit the button to bring open the attachment.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:39]** There's actually two attachments.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:44]** So there's the one attachment is like all the files, every last one sent.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:47]** The other one is that specific message that Harden was referring to.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** And you click on them.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** And you get this like spin wheel message.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:55]** And then it stops.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:59]** And it says message failed to download.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:01]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:05]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:09]** Well, what does it say?

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** I guess we'll find out later.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:14]** Guess we'll find out later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:18]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:21]** Until next week.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:25]** Drift begones at Distant Stars.
