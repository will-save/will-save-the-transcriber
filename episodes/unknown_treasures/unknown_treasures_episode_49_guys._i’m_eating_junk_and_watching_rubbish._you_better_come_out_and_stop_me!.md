## Speaker_0

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:14]** This is Yeoman Chief, terminated in hermidex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:34]** Now I know that as space pirates bannered under the sigil of the free captains, explorers of the drift and uncharted space, plunderers of treasures and the unknown, we have chosen this life in order to escape the many confines of normal society that ordinary folk must abide.


## Speaker_0

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:38]** But there is one peril out there that even we can't escape.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:41]** of bureaucracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:50]** Yes, it seems that even in the far outer reaches of the Drift, there be forms to fill in surveys for Free Captain crews to complete.

**[00:00:51 - 00:00:58]** And as it were, the Free Captains have instructed Goldhorn to conduct such a survey and report back to the Council.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:01]** So here's what I need you to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:12]** Make way to the nearest computer terminal, like the ones you see Rolo always chat with other crews on, or Chuck spending his credits to acquire those interstellar NFTs.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** You know where and what they are, so don't be playing coy with me.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:23]** Once you find a terminal, set a course for survey.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:28]** That's right, survey.willsavethepodcast.com.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:38]** Now, I don't know what this podcast business is all about, but if it can help us navigate the treacherous wastelands of bureaucracy, then it's definitely worth our time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:44]** Once you've arrived, follow the instructions and fill out the survey as truthfully as you can.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:51]** Remember, even as space pirates, we have a code, and that means no lying or cheating on this here survey.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** And don't you dare be thinking of evading it.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** I'll be keeping a watchful eye on all of you through the ship's sensors.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** Once you're done, you can head back to plotting and plundering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:12]** But for now, power down your plasma cannons and head to survey.willsafethepodcast.com, or you forfeit any chance of whatever treasure might await for you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** That is all.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** You have achieved your maiden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:20]** Drift beacons and distant stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:38]** Not long before the events of the Chimera, four space pirates were sent to the desert planet of Akiton to regain their captain's hold over Kafak Depot.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Get in.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Restore balance.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Get out.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** A simple enough plan.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** Batten down the hatches, mateys.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:55]** This is Wind Save and the Interstellar Tales of the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:25]** Welcome back to Will Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** I'm Kevin.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:32]** This is Will, John, Kelly, and Vinny.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** All right, let's cut the crap.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I just want to jump right into combat.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** What?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I'm serious.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** I'm very serious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Foreplay is important, Kevin.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Wait, what?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Role play?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** Foreplay is important, Kevin.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Oh, foreplay.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Yeah, you got to work us up, Kevin.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** I'm not feeling excited enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** I can't just wait.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** So should I start the music again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** You can't just raw dog us and all dry and stuff.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** That's good.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** There's a couple ways that could work.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** This is why people tune into our show.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** I like it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** This is why.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** We're problem solvers.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** That's all we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Hey, you got a problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Do we have the show for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** I can play the last track of Where We Are Now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** Okay, well, I don't know whether I'm cueing the music or not.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Are we bantering?

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** You know what else is a problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Turn on the sexy music, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** Turn on the sexy music.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** I don't know if I have the sexy music in here.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Roxanne!

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** I think the sexiest one I have is this.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:56]** I was going to turn on the red light.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** That's it.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That's all I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Hey, Roxanne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** The Roxanne that I know.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Turn on the red light.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** You know what else takes forever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** Combat.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** Combat takes forever.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Combat takes forever.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Okay.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Is that enough foreplay?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** It's fine, man.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Does it need to be five?

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Is that usually how it goes for you?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Because there's five of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** If you have to ask, Kev.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** Yeah.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:51]** I don't know how you got a second kid out of that.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I'm sorry.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** That was really mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:06]** That might end up on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** This is great.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:26]** loving it please please get us into the action all right how about we play let's play let's play let's play


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:33]** Oh, got real dark real quick.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** The mood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:43]** So last time, you made good enough with each other to head towards the exit, but you stopped when you heard hissing and clanging.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:53]** Before you got too far into investigating that, you were addressed by Tez Tronin of the True Warriors over the intercom system after she had forced Kesh to turn it on for her.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** The true warriors are knocking at the front door.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:01]** Choc stalled them by retelling the classic tale of Starship Alone.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:07]** The others took time to collect scrap and repair the turret in the front.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** Tremei put out a couple of well-placed grenades with some proximity switches.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:32]** thaddeus decided to release rolu cut him from his chains in preparation for the invasion the true warriors then kicked down the door charged in setting off a grenade and triggering the auto turn it shredded that first yusoki and the decoy and it hurt all the other true warriors before it just turned off

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]** And actually, let me take you over to the map because we're in combat.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** I still have you guys in initiative order.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** We're in combat.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Yay.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** I made some edits to the map, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** You did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Just a few little ones.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:47]** I put a red light on the turret for you guys.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** I can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** I can't.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** No, yeah, I can see.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Do you see it now?

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** I can see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Oh, I guess you guys have to move forward to see it.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:58]** Anyway, the turret, I put a little red dot on it to show that it's powered down.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:02]** Just for your awareness, if you're in eyesight of this thing, it could probably see you.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** And if that light is green, it targets everything in sight.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** Unless you're wearing a badge, remember that.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** And there's only two badges for you.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** And Rolu knows nothing about those badges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** We don't need no stinking badges.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** No, I was told that there are badges and that I don't have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:36]** All right, so the three of you are kind of right down the middle, back, zigzag, and then there's those two walls that go off to either side that have gauges and meters and power switches and stuff along those walls.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:41]** You are all kind of cluttered at that intersection just beyond that.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Real tight grouping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Okay.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Yeah, not technically sound, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Yeah, it kind of, though, makes sense.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** I feel like we were like, where should we go?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:56]** And after doing all this work, they just bust open the door and we were caught a little flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Not mechanically, Kev.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Caught with our pants down, if you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** I mean, I don't want to get surrounded, but I guess it's definitely a possibility at this point.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** It's definitely a possibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** I mean, we could take up positions at the end of the hallways if you really wish as time goes on.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** It depends how they funnel in, if they're just going to funnel in straight up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** Right, but if they funnel in to the sides and they go up, then... I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** But we'll see how Kevin plays it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** If only Thaddeus said that in character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** Let's put the fun in funnel.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** And Chuck, it's your turn first.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** So go ahead.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Tell me what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:34]** So Chuck climbed up on Thaddeus' shoulder before we started this encounter.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:43]** I think he's going to stealthily peer around the corner to see what he can see.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** I don't think I see any bad guys.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Actually, you know what?

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** No.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** I'm going to hop down and go over to Thaddeus' shoulder.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Not Thaddeus.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Sorry, I was on Thaddeus.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** To Rolu's shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** All right.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** So that's your move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:03]** And ready his Thasphalt Blaster for the first bogey he sees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I thought you were going to say ready his blaster at Roland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Climbs up his shoulder and sticks a gun to his head.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Yeah.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** It's like a weird Ratatouille.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** So that's your whole turn.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** You're readying in action.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Yeah.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** Yep.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** All right.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** Termite, you said you were also readying something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:29]** Yeah, I readied harrying fire for anything that was coming up the center of the hallway.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:36]** I'm sort of positioned to kind of semi-diagonally check out.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** I could see the corner of the drone.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I can see the little red light you indicated, Kev.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** So I should be able to see anyone.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** I can see kind of the edge of the scanner.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:53]** So if I see somebody rolling past, I should be able to fire off at least a shot.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** And on the next attack, I believe...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:19]** we'll have a plus two against it so whoever attacks it next right you have a plus two from what from harrying fire if i if i meet the dc if that makes sense okay um i am gonna say there's gonna be partial cover right but harrying fire right it's just straight dc 15 yeah 15 okay

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** All right.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** I'll give that to you.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** So it is now the first... Well, I guess technically the second because the first one's dead.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Yusuke's turn.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** And he's going to tell the other guys, I think that turret's down now.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:39]** And he's going to take a skip because his leg is hurting where he got blasted.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** But he's going to move up.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** So that's... He steps over the body.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** And he can kind of see you.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Let me roll perception check.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I don't know if he actually sees you or not.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Phew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:54]** 15 on the die.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** So I'm going to say he doesn't see you and he's going to move forward.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** He looks up at that turret and he stumbles down underneath it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** I can see him a little Yosuke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:08]** And he missed and he's going to actually step right on top of that second grenade.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** And what was that grenade?

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:30]** that's a frag mark two frag mark two uh so i think i'm actually supposed to roll a perception for the proximity switch based off of the level of the proximity switch so the bonus is eight times the mark of the proximity switch so it's probably mark one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:32]** It's a mark one proximity switch.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Actually, I'll let you roll that.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** So roll a d20 plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** And I'm going to roll, I guess, a stealth to counter that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** I think you might be as well.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** I don't know what your stealth is, but I rolled a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Oh, yeah, probably.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** I can roll a natural or a 19 or a 20 to get it.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:55]** I rolled a 19 on the die.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** So you skipped that proximity switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Okay.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** And that's probably going to be... He's going to stop right there.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** And he can see you.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:10]** And he's got his gun kind of up and pointed at you, but he can't pull that trigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** So if I can see him... I can see him too, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Can you see?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** It's very thin.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** So I'm going to say there's partial cover there if you try to take a shot.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:25]** But I'm taking a shot of harrying fire, which is not like necessarily to hit him.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:33]** It's mostly to rattle his nerves and give the next attacker a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Yeah, I believe so.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** So you readied that action.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Do you want to take it?

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Yeah.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** And I got a 16.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** So you start just blasting down the hallway.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** It's just pinging off the walls, but it's enough to give a distraction.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:56]** And as you're doing that, the next warrior, he steps up and trots in, and he cuts off to the right and down the hall, and you can't see where he goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** I think I saw somebody duck off to the right.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Rolu, make sure you watch that corner.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Watch your back, Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:27]** yeah i'll say termay probably had just enough to see like he he just he ditched one way or the other it's probably all i'm gonna give you sorry you're right this is like stage right or like my right i don't know but but i don't actually know all right but i'm not sure exactly what you can see with your with your your token so i can you i mean i can see enough you set off to the right though are you retconning that kevin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:55]** uh i'm i'm saying i don't know what he can see so he he saw movement right let me hear i'll do this i'll do it one step at a time so you can tell me what you see you see him yes okay so i would yeah i saw him move right well he's blind as i saw okay so you did you saw him move all right cool i assume kind of i kind of picked this spot strategy strategy all right thaddeus it's your turn and roly you're next


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** Okay.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Tell me, what do you see?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** There's a guy coming up this hallway.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** He's about to hit my flash.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Oh, yeah?

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** What kind of guy?

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Big guy?

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Small guy?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Yasuki.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Ah, small guy.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:18]** Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's not, you know, no wimp, but maybe he is cannon fodder.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** No, I've dealt with Yasuki.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** All right.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Well...

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:28]** Is there any sort of mechanic for leaning around the corner in Kevin to have partial cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** I don't believe there is.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** I'd have to dig into that.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** I'm assuming there's not.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:40]** You could take the five-foot move out, take a shot, or you could take a shot with cover.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** But right now, you don't even have line of sight with him, right?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:47]** So you'd have to find a way to get a shot on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** Sorry.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Sorry about this, guys.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** I just want to think about it carefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** There's no time to think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:02]** Hey, just so you know, I think he's a little frazzled by that shot I just popped off, so you would get a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Can he see you, Terme?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Probably.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** I don't know if he does or not, but... All right, cool.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** It's dark in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** It's dark in here.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** All right, so he can see Terme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** It's dark in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** Daddy's just going to pop out and take a shot in front of Torme.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:23]** So he moves out into the hallway and fires his formium venom caster, which is fully reloaded.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** That's a 23 to hit.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** And you get a plus two.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** That's a 25 to hit and nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:34]** Okay, so that is a 25 to hit, but he does have cover.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** I forget exactly how much cover he gets.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** Is it four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Not that much cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** But it's still 21 to hit.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** That definitely hits him.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** What's your damage?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Nine points.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Nine points of damage.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Squeak, squeak.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:50 - 00:17:13]** you yeah and what are you shooting your venom caster venom caster yeah so you you just kind of step out raise your gun and just pull trigger like all in one motion like a seasoned vet yeah it strikes the yusoki just right in the chest and he falls back nice dead it's like amazing dead the rated m tom and jerry show


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** I finally got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** All right.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** I felt kind of sad all of a sudden.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** Empty inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** My whole life.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:33]** Rolu hearing Termay say that somebody was going to the right is going to say to Chuck, Chuck, let's cover what's going on to the right here.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** I'm worried about somebody coming up behind us.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** And Rolu's going to start turning.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** That's a good thought, Rolu.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:44]** And walking very measured steps down the hallway at an even pace.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:57]** And as we're going, Rolu whispers, because I think there's, like, the bulge in Jack's pants are right next to Rolu's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** It, like, hits him in the head every so often.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Yeah.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Rolu says...

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:09]** Chuck, do you consider yourself a good, true Raxalite?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:15]** As Rolo is double moving, carefully stepping forward down to the end of the hall.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** And that is 50 feet of movement.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:21]** And I have 10 feet left if I want to do two move actions.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** So can I peek around the corner, Kev, and see if there's anybody there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:29]** I mean, you could do a five foot step and then a five foot step back is what you're saying, right?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** With your movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Yeah, I guess he has to do a perception check though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Yes.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** I was not asking mechanically.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** I'm just trying to look like for flavor.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** I'm not stepping out.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** I'm just looking around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Well, you still have to.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I'll let you do that.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Do you go to five feet out?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** See if you see anything and then move your character back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Great.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:51]** And as you're saying that, we have the tough warrior moving in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** There's another one.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** He looks like he's going off to the left.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** To be fair, Rollo, you can't see anything usually.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:00]** Is it just you can't see very far down the hall, or you saw all the way to the end?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** You saw nothing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** No, I saw all the way to the end.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Yes, thank you for your commentary.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** At least your hearing's good.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Good, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Yes, we have communists.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** There's another one coming in, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** That one's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** It was moving.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Oh, you just moved it?

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** The dead one moved just now, but I think it's okay.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** This ship is crazy.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** So we got somebody maybe coming down this hallway on the left.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** I think I should stay here.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** Take the point up in the center.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:34]** Maybe Thaddeus, you might want to head down the left side of the hallway just to cover that side.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** I don't know.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:41]** And I can alert everyone with the mind link if I see any more movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Yep.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** I like your tactics for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Termay, keep directing traffic.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** We'll hold them back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Yeah, absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** And Vrolu, of course.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** I'm the best Raxalite there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** All right, Termay, it's your turn.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** You're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** I'm going to do the same thing.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:05]** I'm going to basically observe and try and direct.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:09]** See, I strategically placed myself here.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:12]** So I'm going to ready harrying fire again.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** If anyone comes up the center.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** And then hopefully they hit the trap.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** And if they spring it next time, then we'll go from there.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** And we'll switch up tactics.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** I don't know.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** So you're holding your spot.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** Holding the spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:26]** Okay.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** Chuck, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:37]** I'm going to switch shoulders to the one closer to the corner and peer out to see if I see any bogeys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Do I see any bogeys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** They could have gone through the... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** You can give me a perception check if you want.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** The rooms also.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** I'll do a perception check.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Just watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** 20 on the die for 27.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:51 - 00:21:00]** All right, you don't see anything, but you hear, and this guy's like trying to sneak around, but he's not very good at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** From which direction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Down south of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:13]** I turn to Roland and say, hey, he's trying to sneak over here, but he's got boots full of sand or something.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** Stay frosty.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:20]** and aims down the sights of his asphalt blaster.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Let's take care of it.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** And now it's his turn.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** So you're holding an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** Yeah, I'm readying to fire when I see someone I want to shoot.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** When you see the whites of his eyes, that's when you pull it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Thank you for the clarification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** All right.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:43]** So he is going to step out with his gun raised.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** And you're saying you're going to take an action as soon as you see him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Yeah.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Surprise, motherf***er.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:48]** There it is.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Here's some fries, motherf***er.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** So take your shot.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** All rise, motherf***er.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** Hot eyes, motherf***er.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** The whites of your eyes, motherf***er.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** So much editing.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** Cool.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** I'm going to do the full round attack.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** You were on his shoulder.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** You didn't move, but you had to use your move action to get there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** I guess I did.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Cool.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** One attack is a 10.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** It's a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** 10.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Fastfall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** I think it's EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** I think so, too.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Because it's force?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Yes.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** Yes.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** It's EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Wow.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** I'm surprised.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Hit him where it hurts.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** I'm a little surprised, too.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Okay, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** So 1d4 plus 2.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** So that's two, four force damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Four force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:49]** So he's just like, as soon as the thug jumps out, you see Chuck like flinch.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:56]** And as he flinches, he pulls the trigger and like it almost misses, but like grazes him in the shoulder.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Hits him in the shoulder.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:06]** He kind of shakes it off and keeps moving because he was in the middle of his move action when that happened, so it just gave him pause.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Nice.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** All right.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** That's the end of that true warrior's turn.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** He is now in position to attack you guys.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** I'm ready to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** You guys doing okay down there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** And it's Thaddeus' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** You were fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** Thaddeus agrees with Torme's assessment, and he's going to move left.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Shut up.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:35]** And he can only move 20 feet, so he's going to take a full action to move 40 feet because he's very heavily armored.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** It doesn't make it quite all the way to the left side, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** And then he tells Roland to shut up.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:46]** On the right side of the map, this true warrior comes up, and Chuck takes a shot at him.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:53]** And Thaddeus hears the shot from the right side of the map, and his first action is to move away from the gaslighting right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I'm so tired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** But I told him to go that way.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Who am I speaking to in just fine section, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** He's talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** I'm just talking into the void.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** Tremay's the precog.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** He could, like, see it coming.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** Like, all the f***ing, like, unwarranted shade.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** Anyway.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** You can see past the fourth wall.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** Yes.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** For tactical reasons, Thaddeus has moved to the left.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** Roller would shock and handle themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** Use both move actions to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:23]** I do, so.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Okay.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Yeah, I can only move 40 feet with a full.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Roller, you're up.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** All right.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Because of my heavy f***ing armor.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:36]** So I would know that that tough, true warrior was right around the corner, and I see them start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** This one's not the tough one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Okay.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:41]** Well, I see somebody around the corner.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** I thought you said there was a tough warrior.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** There is a tough warrior.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Okay.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** Well, I can see somebody 10 feet away on the other side of the hallway.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** That's just a regular true warrior.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:57]** Well, then... Freaking apologies, Mr. Regular True Warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** That is not the Deluxe True Warrior.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** This is a Regular True Warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Kevin has a tomato on this one.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Exactly.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:07]** Kevin has made 50 enemies, and he classified them appropriately, so make sure you know.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** That's True Warrior number one.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Slightly less typical True Warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Yes.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** All right.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:19]** Then, as soon as that person steps into view...

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:43]** rolu just takes in for a brief second all that has happened today since getting up since yesterday with the fight with the three armies and just channels that energy out onto this regular true warrior as he casts the day's weariness


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** What in the world is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:48]** And you need to make a will save.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Will save!

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Make a will save, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** DC 15.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** You guys do this kind of shit, and I gotta look up what his will is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Oh, it's not very good.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Just give me a will save.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** 14.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Woo!

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Woo!

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** You didn't make it.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:08]** Instead, you are going to take 18 points of damage.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Holy crap!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** What kind of spell is this?

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** 4d8.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** Yeah, it's level 2.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Roloo is not messing around.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** That's crazy.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Not bad, not bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** And what exactly does this spell do?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** You have to make a will save or else you take four.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:29]** Will save, if you pass, it's half of 4d8 damage.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** And if it's not, then you take all of it.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:43]** And the description is pretty much you launch an opponent's mind forward in time, forcing them to experience a day's event in a moment.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:51]** And they are now fatigued for the duration, which is going to be four rounds.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** They are fatigued.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** And how much damage was it?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:00]** So he steps out, takes a shot to his shoulder, kind of shakes it off, turns back.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:11]** And then almost immediately, it's like as he turns back, his vision kind of just fades into darkness because he doesn't have a future.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** And you kill him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** With your brain.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** Killed him with emotional damage.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** Emotional damage.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Absolutely dead.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Shout out Kevin.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** As he falls.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:41]** Verloo says to Jack, if you're the best, then you must realize that people like them, points to the dead true warrior, and some people in the free captains are not good people.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:47]** They don't share the same optimistic views that you and I do as good people.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** And that's all he says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** what are you rambling about down there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:58]** I can't quite hear it, but you know, just, just killing, killing true warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** We're clear on this side.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:08]** So he is dead, and there's only one tough true warrior left, but you have no idea where he's at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Ninja.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Yes.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Oh, hey, I see.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** And then I see some movement.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Where is it?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Where?

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:20]** In the center, but I think he's about to hit that flash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Give me a second.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** So I'm moving him up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** He should have triggered it.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:53]** no i have to roll for it and that's what i'm doing uh it's a dc-16 by the way i looked it up okay what's for the proximity yeah so i'll read it single use device turns an explosive charge into a trap triggering when it senses nearby motion when arming a primary explosive charge while performing demolitions you can install a proximity switch into the explosive charge instead of programming a detonator to activate charge as a standard action you can arm blah blah blah blah okay

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:05]** An arm switch observes its surroundings with blind sight vibration, automatically attempting perception checks with a bonus equal to eight times its mark to detect anyone moving within five feet.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:12]** If the device detects movement from a tiny or large creature, it says the DC is 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** I think that's a DC to disable.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Disarm it?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:21]** Because it's saying it's a perception check of eight times the mark.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:26]** So it would be a bonus of eight to the perception check.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** This guy has no stealth.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:30]** So yeah, he's sneaking up against that wall.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:35]** I picture like Kronk from Emperor's New Groove.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** But he's not very good at it.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Boom.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:40]** And this was a flash grenade.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** So he is blinded for how many rounds?

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:43]** 1d4.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** What is my save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:50]** Your save is, I think, reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** All right.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Yeah.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** It's just a reflex.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** DC 12.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** So you might actually do it.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** But wait a second.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Hold on.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:05]** It says each creature within the blast radius takes a list of damage, but can attempt to reflex saving throw for half damage.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** So does that mean you're blinded for half the round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** I think that's generic for grenades.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:15]** Because the damage is just blinded for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:37]** right it's 1d4 rounds and explode dc is 12 so if you beat the reflex save for that i would say that i hit 12 okay so roll d4 for one round okay so he's blinded for one round got it dope and that's the end of his turn so it is now going to be the top of the round termay you're up oh

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:59]** just a moment i think uh what i'm gonna do let me i'm gonna take a step out about 10 feet to the right so i get a nice clean shot i believe on this uh this dude i'll be like surprise mother trucker it's a 16 to hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** 16 hits.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Nice.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** How much damage are you doing?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** My D6.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** This is your frost pistol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** This is the frostbite class zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** Cool.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:19]** That's max damage for an eight point.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** Nice.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Ouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** That's a lot of damage to this guy.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** He's got blasted by the turret and now hit by your frostiness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Rough day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Frosty McFrost pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** And he's blind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** And he's blind.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Oh, he's also flat-footed, so his AC goes down.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:37]** It's a minus four penalty to strength and dexterity skills.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Yikes.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Can only rely on vision.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Wow.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Pretty good.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** This is rough.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** He can't rely on vision because he's blinded.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Yeah.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** That's what I know.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:50]** All activities that rely on vision automatically fail.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Okay.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** So, Termay, did you move and shoot or you just shot?

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** I moved and shot.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** So that is the end of your turn.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Chuck, you're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** What are you doing?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** From behind, Termay, here's...

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Yeah, your mom was a trucker.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** And he turns to Rulu.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** What's a trucker?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** You'll find out one day.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Never mind.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:18]** And he's going to sense that there's another true warrior nearby.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:25]** And so he's going to close his eyes and reach out with his vines and see if he can sense where the true warrior is.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Chuck, you turned off your targeting computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:51]** use your feelings don't trust oh chalk just took a step toward the dark side that's an 11 oh all right it was a cutting warrior and a good friend and what are you trying to do sorry i missed it uh i think i'm listening for the oh perception tough true or yeah 11 is the rule


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:52 - 00:33:00]** I'll just tell you, you know that it's somewhere within the line of sight for Treme because you just heard him shoot his ice pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** This guy's over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:14]** You bring all your leaves together to focus, to listen, and you don't hear anything, but you see Treme, a flash near Treme.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** So you know it's somewhere over that region.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Okay.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Then I'm going to hop down.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Rulu, you got this.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** And make my way downtown.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Let's see.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:31]** Yeah, I'll just move over to next to Termadin.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** I'll bet.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Yeah.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** And that's my return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Hop down and run.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** Thaddeus, you're up.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:41]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:51]** Thaddeus continues his crawl towards possible combat and makes it with one movement turn to the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:56]** Hey, I don't think that he went that way.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Thaddeus, I think he's right here.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** That was the guy who went left, right?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** I'm not sure.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** I didn't see anybody else come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** Thaddeus is not apprised of all the whereabouts of everyone, so he's just going to check around this corner to see if anyone's there.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** But I guess he'll ask Torme, Torme, do you need help over there?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:28]** i don't know do you see anyone is there anyone there oh yeah there's a guy here he's blind though all right did you did he get attacked is he weakened or what's going on with that guy uh i mean he's still standing but he's been getting hit right

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:32]** Yeah, I think he's got some life left in him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:36]** All right, well, I'm going to check around this corner, and I'll be here if you need something, all right?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** Yeah.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:46]** I have a long range on my weapons, and Thaddeus is going to peek around the... Can I go around, look for something, and then go back if needs be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** You guys keep asking me this, and I have not had time to look it up myself, but I'm pretty sure it's just a move action.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** You can move five feet out and then move five feet back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:59]** That is your... Does Thaddeus see... Like, visually, I don't see anything, but, like, is there actually anything there?

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** If you don't see a token, there's probably nothing there.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I'm just making sure.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Okay.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** So you turn around that corner, you look down the hallway, you don't see anything.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** If you want to do a perception check, I can tell you whether or not you hear something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Ah.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** All right, cool.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** I will do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:21]** I think you guys are all pretty much aware that, oh, yes, you're looking for others, but you know for a fact that there's one guy near TremÃ©.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** I know that.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** But I think we're okay on that for now.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:29]** So I don't want to get flanked.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Anyway, so perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:40]** By the way, the rules for cover and around corners is given in the example on page 253.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:48]** Your complaints, Kevin, pierce the fourth wall, and that's all that Thaddeus can hear, so he only rolls like a six for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:54]** Yeah, you don't... I think your ear's ringing because you have really good hearing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** It's like, blah, blah, blah, I haven't read the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Oh, that's what you hear?

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** That's what I hear, yeah.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Everyone keeps asking me.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** All right, Rolu, you're up next.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:10]** Well, Chuck went the other way, and I'm by myself, and there's this body of this true warrior in front of me.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** But Rolu is going to advance.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** I'm moving up.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** I'm moving forward.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:25]** And Rolu walks around the corner, looks, doesn't see anybody down the 60 feet, can just barely make out at the end of the wall.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Strides forward 10 feet.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** That's about 15 feet of movement.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:39]** Steps around to look around the corner at 20 feet of movement and sees what I think is the blinded true warrior in the center of the hall.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Maybe 70 feet away.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Let me see what this is.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Is that right?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Yes.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** 70 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** 70 feet.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** I concur with your measurements on Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** Why, thank you.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** That's very great.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:56]** Good thing the range on my azimuth serpent laser is 100 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:00]** Just remember, it is dim light and you have regular vision.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** So I need to go to... So that's a 20% concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Okay.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Sorry.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** 20%.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Absolutely right.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Yes.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Okay.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:12]** So going to aim down the sight with my move action and take a shot.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Breathe in.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** Breathe out in the mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** Pull it.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Squeeze the trigger in between heartbeats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:28]** Rolu gets a 10 against KAC.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** Can't quite make out.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:39]** Isn't sure if they have him lined up and if it's maybe a wire hanging from the ceiling or if it's the head of the true warrior or a conduit.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** What?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** And takes a shot to the head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** Flat-footed is only a minus two, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Okay, so it's not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:53]** Okay, flat-footed, blinded, and... Well, blinded leads to flat-footed.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** Which leads to anger.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** And harrying.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** Which leads to hate.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Which leads to suffering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Oh, he had harrying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Who had harrying?

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** I didn't do harrying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** You didn't do harrying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** He did harrying on the last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** He actually shot this guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Got it.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Never mind.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:14]** So it flies over their head, hits the end of the hall, probably in front of Thaddeus.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** I can't see where Thaddeus is.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I just know you're on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:28]** So this true warrior, he's blinded, and he feels against the wall, and he knows he just got shot from TremÃ©'s direction.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:33]** So he can move up to half his speed and he's going to get right up against Treme.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:38]** And I'm trying to figure out and see what does it do to your attacks?

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:45]** You can observe other creatures, which means among other things that you treat all creatures as having total concealment, 50% miss chance.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:51]** So he's going to swing at Treme, but he has a 50% chance to miss.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** All right.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Come on, miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** You better, better, better.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Does a 16 hit?

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** Yeah, it'll hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Roll that mysterious.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** I rolled a 50.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** I think that goes to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** So I haven't rolled the ones yet.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** So that is a hit.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:18]** So he is going to strike you for 1d6 plus forward damage.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** So that is seven points of damage.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Okay.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:28]** So he's blind, but he swings, and he just kind of clips you just right.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** That's the end of his turn.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Tormade, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:45]** I'm going to take a guarded step back next to Chalk, and...

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:53]** I'm just going to fire with the pistol again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** He's right here, guys.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** I think that's going to be a mix.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Six.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** So I was a little startled by a blind man hitting me.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** So you missed your shot.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Chuck, you're up.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** What are you doing?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** You're right there next to Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:23]** I guess he expected to see a giant true warrior come around, but hearing this dude lumber over, flailing, hitting Torme, he's like, oh, no, we need to put this guy down.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Oh, no, we need to put this guy down.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** And fires with both barrels.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Woof!

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Yay!

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Do it.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** After Tomei gets hit.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Do it.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** This is EAC, correct?

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Yes.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Okay.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:41]** This is a nine and an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** The nine misses the 18 hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** So how much damage are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Wow.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Get it, Chuck.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Find my D4.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Here, you need one?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** Here you go.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Appreciate it.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Yep.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Yep.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** Oh, that's a three plus two.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** That's five force damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:09]** This is like a purple shotgun, right?

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** It's like purple crystals.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Like a needler, kind of.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Blast.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Hits him in the face.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** He is hurt pretty bad.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** That's all I can say, but he's still standing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:33]** Also, Benny, I have to say, every time that you fire your gun, you mimic it here on Zoom, and the way you do looks like it is scale if you were a rat.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:39]** The way that you do it is like you're holding a little gun, and I don't know if you're doing that consciously.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** It's quite amazing to watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** It's great.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Well, thanks.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** I appreciate that.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** All right, Chuck, your turn is up.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:55]** Thaddeus now sees in the dim light, he does see this big guy.

**[00:41:55 - 00:42:05]** So he's going to move 20 feet forward just in range of him and going to fire off his own little needle, which is Venomcaster.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Darts, technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:09]** Chuck's little gun does a big shot.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Thaddeus' big gun does a little shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** That's good stuff.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** That's a 21 to hit, my good man.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** This is like a Borderlands game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Whoa, whoa, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:49]** the whole map just moved around us the stellar flare has like dislodged itself in the sand yeah it starts like taking off there's a sand worm that's starting to eat it oh my god all right you're taking your shot what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** It's a 21 to hit.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** So I'm guessing that hits.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:59]** And he fires it right into, let's just say one of the eyeballs of this guy for like seven damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:04]** Oh, you know, just through the back of his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** He's like three quarters blind now.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:06]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:09]** Thaddeus runs away from every combat and then comes back for the kill shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:14]** That's fucking called being smart, bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Every time.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:27]** So this poor blind guy staggers his way up, gets one hit off before he's blasted with asphalt, frost shot, shot by a turret, and then gets sniped in the back of the head.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** Heh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** I thought it was in the eye.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Oh, well.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** It goes through the back of his head through the eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Well, he's looking the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** All right, cool.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Amazing.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** So you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** You get him through the eye, but from behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** That must have been a sight to see for Shaq and TremÃ©.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:47]** So I imagine the needle goes through and his eye just explodes all over Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:55]** Oh, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Game of Thrones death.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Yeah.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Incredible.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** The steam's just coming off the barrel of this gun.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** It just blows out like, Oh man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** Just do.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** Oh man.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:07]** Jack rolled a six on his constitution save.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:12]** So I think he loses his lunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Oh, gross.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** What did Chuck do for lunch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Yeah.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** I think he had... Good cue.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** He had some kefak nuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Dried?

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:26]** Defined nuts.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Honey roasted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** Yeah.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Honey roasted Kefauk nuts.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** They're not actually made from Kefauk.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** They're like beaver nuts, where they're like just some sort of like... Like lembas bread.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** Puffed grain.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Lembas bread.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** But they look like Kefauk nuts.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Never even heard of that, but it sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Yeah.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** All right.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Cool.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** Well, that came in clutch.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** I thought we were going somewhere else, but I like it.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** I'm sorry you threw up, though.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Oh, poor buddy.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** I don't know if there's more of them, but...

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** These guys seem dead.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** Roldu, stop making Shaq throw up with your weird comments.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Any of you like reloads?

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** I'm pretty sure that was you.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Nah, he doesn't have time to reload.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Anyway, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** I'm gonna take you out of initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** What are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Uh...

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:20]** Is there still... Oh, come on, Kevin.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** I hear the pulsing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** John's in control of the music.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** John, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:30]** I'm going to move back to where I was and just peer out and make sure nobody else is coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:35]** I think the drone's back on.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Just FYI.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Oh, yes.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Beautiful.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** I'm glad you noticed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** The drone that we now control.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Do we all hear that?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** The one that we repaired?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Well, I could mind link it.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Thanks, Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Thanks, Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:55]** So, Torme, as you walk up, yeah, there's a hum, and as you see the turret kind of shift up a little bit, and that light turns green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:06]** I think for a brief moment, as soon as that true warrior went down, Rulu paused and realized that he is on one side of the ship by himself.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:14]** And then he hears Torme say, I think the drone's back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** And Rulu sighs.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:22]** Uh, Chuck also realized that he left Rolu by himself, so he's gonna sprint back to the corner they were both at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Oh, is Chuck on Rolu duty?

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Is that what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:33]** Thaddeus looks a little concerned for Chuck, because he's been spending a lot of time with Rolu, but, like, he's just kinda, kinda, like, looking out to make sure he's okay.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:38]** It's like, it's like the memes where it's like, one day was Rolu.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** One day was Rolu.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:43]** Oh, I see what you're saying.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** One month was Rolu.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** What are you drawing paintings at the start?

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** What

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:52]** One month with Rolu.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Okay.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** We can't let it happen.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** It's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** Rolu, where were you headed anyhow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:04]** I was just over here trying to take out the one that I think got all over Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** The one that almost got away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** Yeah, and I shot, but I missed.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:12]** I'm here on the eastern edge.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Chuck is right here with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Same could be almost said about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** The camera is going to shift over.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Sorry, what was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** The one who almost got away.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** I hope you didn't almost get away.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** We're keeping an eye on the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:33]** No, I definitely would not consider that given the past hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** The turret would have just taken you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:57]** wait a second yeah for sure watch make sure that puck's tight on your body all right don't you you know what i'm saying right he's really close to you chuck looks down and looks back at thaddeus and looks down and looks back at thaddeus yeah that's right opens up his pants still there here's what he does he looks down and he knocks on it he knocks on it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Still there, still there, Weps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Come on, Cobb.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Let's see this through.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** A little sigh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** Chuck hops up on Cobb's shoulder.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:21]** All right, so the camera is going to shift, and it's going to show four true warriors leaned up against the wall outside the Stellar Flare.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:31]** That first one, the one closest to the door, is going to pick up a rock and chuck it inside of the airlock area and wait.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** It clambers to a stop and nothing happens.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** So that first one cautiously walks into the airlock area.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** And the other three follow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** I'm guessing we don't know this is happening unless we hear that rock scatter in there.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Right.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Do we need to roll perception to figure out how much of this we heard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** No, this is just, I'm just giving you some flea.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** This is just happening.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** You now each get one turn.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** One free turn.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** You get a move action and a stare action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Tremay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:14]** I'm holding my position and I'm going to do my harrying fire if one comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Does anyone hurt?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** Rolu whispers into the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:23]** I mean, I got hit a little bit, but I'll be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Do you need healing?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Sure.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Do you want healing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Can you heal stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Yes, I can.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** That's what Blessings of Youth does.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** I have a free... The problem is that I only have a... Is it limited?

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** Move, and it's... I would just wait.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** You sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:38]** Yeah, I'm good, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Okay.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** All right.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Well, that's... Hold on.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** My range is 35.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:48]** I can move 30 feet, and then I have a range of 35 feet.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:52]** So I don't... I think you're just out of reach, Torme, with that spell.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Don't worry about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Don't worry.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** I'll be fine.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:04]** I got some Helix Serum still, and I got a little surprise for anyone who wants to come up this hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Excellent.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** Chuck, should we wait right here?

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:15]** And he steps over to behind the corner, just, you know, 20 feet ahead of the corner that they were hanging out at before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:19]** I'm going to hop on the comms and say, what's the plan, Geister?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Are you still going to be calling out bogeys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** I'll call him out from the kill zone down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Perfect.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Then, yeah, Brolu and I'll stay posted up on the east side.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** Thaddeus, you stay posted up on the west.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:38]** The call, if you need help, is Grasshopper.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Repeat, Grasshopper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:45]** Grasshopper.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** All right, so that's your whole turn.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** Thaddeus, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:48 - 00:51:00]** Thaddeus is going to move to the hallway next to Terme behind the dead body of like that tough warrior or whatever it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** No, it's just his.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** We should maybe use him for cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:09]** He's got a whole dumpy and you're just like, yeah, I'll just hide behind this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Ew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** He's going to reload as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Total cover.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** And who has the two badges?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** I have the badge.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** I think you have one and Thaddeus has one.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Yeah, I do too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:28]** Okay, I'm going to put green lights on you guys so I know you two have badges and the other two don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** We got the stinking badges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:34]** And you're lucky you said that because you just walked into the site of this turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:37]** Yeah, dope.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:41]** Guys, the rest of you keep away from that drone while it's engaged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** Okay, I need you each to roll initiative.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:47]** You all got one full turn, right?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** I just want to confirm that.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I mean, I readied an action.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** I don't know if that counts as a turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** In combat, you readied an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:01]** So I get maybe if somebody comes up, I guess I get maybe a surprise for Harry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** You would get until your next turn.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** I'm giving you until your next turn.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:10]** So wherever you fall in initiative order, you have it readied until that turn.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** 23, Kevin.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** Or until the round, I forget.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** 23 for who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** 23 for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Thaddeus got 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** 15 for Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** 16 for Torme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:23]** Roloo also... Roloo also got 23.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Okay.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Who has the better dexterity, if that is?

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** That's a good question, Roldu.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** You're really sneaky, which means you probably have good dexterity.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** But I'm a cat, you see.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** Out of 20, mine is a 16.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** If I had to put a finger in the wind.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** What's your modifier?

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** I have 14, my good sir.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Yeah, so my modifier beats you.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Modifiers also, too.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Okay.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** My modifier sunk your modifier's battleship.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Did it because it's, like, the same modifier?

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** No, it's plus three.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** No, 16 is plus three.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Yeah, 14 plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** Learn your battleships.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** That's what you get by having multiple personalities and stuff, kids.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** You get to become very dexterous in social situations like World of Warcraft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Except one-on-one conversations.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** I thought we were almost done with combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Not quite.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:25]** As you guys are discussing nervously what's going to happen next, a tough true warrior, and I guess, can you see this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** Yeah, I can see right up to here.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Yeah, I can see clear the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:59]** okay uh so this tough true warrior comes like marching in from the outside with the door the like i still see the dead one by the way yeah okay oh you're gonna see all the dead ones nice yeah that's what i like to hear uh so this tough true warrior picks up one of the panels from outside that fell off earlier like before you guys even came in here and he's gonna walk forward with this heavy thick metal panel and he sets it right at the front at the scanner entrance

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** And he pushes it through.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:07]** And as he does, that turret drops down and starts shooting.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** Doesn't target you two, but it targets him.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:15]** And as he does that, he takes damage.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:27]** But at the same time, a Yosuke slides in and yanks out the scanner's cables and connects a couple of wires and taps away at it.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:33]** Sure enough, it goes from... winds down.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** And now it's just drooping.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** That has been disabled.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Let me tell you how much...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** They took out the drone.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** I can't do math in my head.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Okay.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** That's your warrior.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** I'm not going to tell you how much damage you took.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** You just picked an arbitrary number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** No, I was doing math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** I can't do math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** I was doing math in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** But I got a number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** So here it is.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** The true warrior.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** He's got his shield up.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** He marched right there.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** He takes all the damage.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:14]** And then this Hisoki runs in and slides around the corner and disables the turret.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** And now the turret is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:24]** And then a lieutenant walks up and she... Yo, I think they brought in the big guns now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** Is it Tez Tronin?

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Can you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Might be.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** They're stacked up in one spot.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** Be a perfect time to come in there.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Throw a grenade down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Noted.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Chuck, do you have a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Not a bad idea.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** She stands right underneath the turret and holds her fist up.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Tez Tronin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** And that's our game.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Oh, all right.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** Wow.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:54]** So either she's telling them to stop.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** I don't know where I was going with that.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:04]** I just said something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Thanks for listening, you scallywags.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:13]** Until next week, drift beguines on Distant Stars.
