## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:56 - 00:00:57]** Hello, everyone.

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:00]** This is Kevin, and this is Plot Armor.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:04]** We're finally at Plot Armor for Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:07]** We all made it out alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:11]** Just in case you started here and didn't know where else.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:23]** Plot Armor is our end of the game, end of the book, I guess, kind of overall review of what we did during the game.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:26]** This was a little different because I was a GM, a first-time-ever GM.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Woo!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:31]** And I'll actually tell you what was in the book and what wasn't.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:34]** So I think it's a fun aspect of this plot armor.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:39]** The other thing is that this plot armor is a little overdue.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** And I'm so sorry.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** Overdue how, Kev?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Yeah.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** It all went in a good thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:52]** Well, I think my conservative estimate of how long this podcast would take was 13 episodes.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** And this is after episode 53.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** So we're 40 episodes over my estimate.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** 4-0.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** Kevin, I don't think you need to apologize or anything.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Because again, we are driving the story.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** So you don't need to just be like, hey!

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Well, this is a topic I've had conversations about.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:15]** When I was younger and wasn't making much money, when I bought a video game, I was like, man, I would buy a $60 video game.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:20]** That took me like four and a half hours to afford or whatever the amount was, 10 hours.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** But I'd get 80 hours out of it.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:26]** And I was like, man, that was cost effective to buy that video game and play it.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:33]** So if you're listening to our podcast, I know it costs nothing to you, but I stretched that game out so long that it was worth it.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:57]** that's how i that's how i'm looking at it um no but i think i think it's fun to talk about so like we're playing we're playing through threefold conspiracy on our main game and at one point john and i started talking about like i i want to run a game i've never run a game before and i think it'd be fun for me to try and record it and uh we came up with this idea but we also came up with the idea like well what if we put one of our what if we pull a side character

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** And we make this game about a side character.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** And that character we decided to come with was Rolu, which Rolu was a character from Kelly.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:17]** Kelly, you just create, tell us a little bit how, like when you were writing, writing the intro to the first episode of We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Woo!


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:23]** I hate to disappoint you again because we talked about it a little bit once.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:35]** But yeah, literally, I just needed – I was writing here's a story and I was like, here's sort of needs like a motivation to do X, Y, or Z. And he also needs something given to him for his story.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** So I was like, I can accomplish this in one, these two things with one person.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:44]** And then I created Roloo, whose name actually, this is how much thought I put into Roloo originally.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:51]** His name, like, I don't know why I was thinking of those, like, there's these like little disc candies that are named Rolos or something.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I love Rolos.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** Yeah, yeah, that.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Caramel filled chocolate.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** This is how much I thought about Roloo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Rolo's dope.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:05]** That was actually the name of my Roomba for a hot minute because it looks like a Rolo candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Now you got to call him Rolo for sure.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** So then I just made him this brawny, kind dude.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** And I just needed him to die.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** And I needed him to give Hears a puck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Well, he died.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** He died well.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** He did die very well.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Spoil alert.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** If you haven't listened to We'll Save the Podcast, Rolu dies.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** We know that.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** In fact, Rolu knew that.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** Because Rolu is a precog.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** And he was able to see that in his mind's eye.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** And apparently there's something to do with the veil.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:44]** And that's how we did our last episode was there was the veil and a character that only Kelly and I knew of named the narrator.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** That is literally the title we gave him because I love that title so much.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** But we'll talk about it at the very end.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** You got to stick around.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** But what I want to do for this plot armor, since I'm running the show, I'm still kind of the GM, right?

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** I want to take us all the way back to the very beginning.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** The very, very beginning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Until you die or we find somebody better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:15]** Which was going to be something that we were going to incorporate in that phase from Starship Troopers, but it never happened.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Sorry.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** That was just me being funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:20]** It was in the script, but you guys threw the script out the window.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** We'll talk about that later.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:28]** So rewinding all the way back to the very beginning of the show, we are at low power, right?

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** So our characters are only, it starts at level one.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:36]** This book, Junker's Delight is a fantastic book written by Jason Keeley.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Again, thank you for joining us on the show.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** He joins us at the very end.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** It's written for new GMs.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** It's great.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** It has all these side comments and notes that tell you like, hey, it's your first time GMing.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** So like, make sure you tell this.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** One of them was like, hey, double check radiation rules before you go into this combat, which I missed.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** some other fun stuff like that.

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:01]** But one thing I want to note is like Rolu, when we dropped him into this, this game, Rolu starts off at level one, but like, he's not weak.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** If that makes sense.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** He is a seasoned pirate.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:12]** That's been out in space for, you know, 20 years probably at this point, but he's coming to this game as, as only level one.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** And I think that I just want to scale that idea.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** Like we, as, as this podcast, I don't think we've ever reached above level five.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Hmm.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** Just an idea there is level scaling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** What about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** What are you trying to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** I want to add something to the roller thing.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:37]** I did develop one part of his character only, really, that John has done very well at, which is he's a master of espionage.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** He is very capable of doing great evil.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:49]** And maybe the viewer might have differing opinions on whether he's good or bad or how well he uses those.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** But I was just impressed to see John flesh him out so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:07:14]** i love john's portrayal of him yeah like the gentleman pirate i think i got a little too close to the sun maybe a method actor because now i just feel like i know verlo's mannerisms and motivations that even when i'm improvving lines i will say something and then later i'll be like okay yeah that was cool and then as we'll see some of you are like

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** what does that mean?

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:23]** And I'm like, I literally thought I was just doing something normal, but I'm, I'm just, if, if, if I'm in a rolling mood, I'm just sus.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:31]** If you think about the beginning of threefold, like very first book, you opened with vignettes on each of the characters, right?

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** And I, I feel like this entire adventure has informed.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Here's his vignette so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Right.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** And that was the plan.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:46]** It was, this is, this is a story about Rolu, but it's a story about Rolu's connection to Hears and what, and we, we talk about that.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** We, and we'll get into that a little bit later too.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** And I think a lot with that is Hears is a, is a former free captain.

**[00:07:52 - 00:08:01]** So what I chose to do for this, this run, this very short run was to put four pirates on Akitan and let them run through Junkers Delight.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** I went to each of you and said, hey, I'm going to build – you guys are going to build pirates.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** Here's the idea, like blah, blah, blah.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:18]** And it's funny because I think with Torme, I was trying to do something clever and like throw – I was like, oh, yeah, this is – Will, tell us about your character and the captain speaks.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** And you guys were all supposed to go, wow, he's the captain, but that wasn't it.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:26]** But it's funny because Will doesn't take anything as just a short –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** I don't know what you mean by that.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** There are no throwaways with Wade.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:34]** I don't know what that really even means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** Goldhorn is just so larger than life.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** He's so developed and so amazing.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** I want to see more of Goldhorn, and that's on John's shoulders there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** That is true.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** That would be amazing to see.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** I love Goldhorn.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** I wish we got to see more of him.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** In fact, I would love to serve under a captain like him.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** It's super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** It would be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** 10 out of 10 would recommend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:05]** I mean, the noir, they're a complicated species, race, whatever, however you slice it.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** That's quite interesting and it seems perfect for a captain.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:21]** So it just, it flowed naturally just from the rich Starfinder exposition of both the lore as well as the like sort of traits that,

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** different species come with.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:32]** Yeah, I thought like Goldhorn was just like a very menacing, foreboding kind of figure in space.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** I agree.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** He was perfect.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:37]** Fueled by this sort of like beastly sort of drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** The atmosphere of...

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** Every scene he's in is incredible.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** Like the steam or smoke coming off of him.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:48]** The glow of his eyes, I think it is, if I'm not... He's got like bright pink eyes.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:52]** Yeah, it's always like very often set in like a dark room.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:56]** It's like, that is the most memorable imagery to me of a character.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:00]** And UT is for sure a gold one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:23]** well he's like in a meat locker because he likes it cold so his like there's just steam rising off of him at all times like he was amazing and he was such an amazing addition to the caduceus which was also a hey i i tossed it as just as as an assignment to vinny i was like vinny make me a ship that's all i told him make me a ship and you came up with this amazing you know

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:38]** development and that turns into like a life form of its own because the caduceus is and the living breathing you know amalgamation of all you guys and your crew and you know piracy in general um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:38 - 00:11:02]** but yeah it was beautiful so like from from concept like i wanted caduceus to have an underlying meaning not just a cool name so like if uh thinking through what we might use for symbolism turns to greek mythology so like um or uh i think it was hermes i'm gonna google this because i don't

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Yeah, Hermes.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** So Hermes was the Greek god of basically piracy.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** But I didn't want to go straight there.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** So I was trying to figure out symbols that might be related to Hermes.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** And his staff kept coming up.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:23]** The caduceus, the staff, most people would associate with medical assistance.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** So healing as well as doctors and rehabilitation services.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:44]** So I think it's actually in hindsight been really interesting to see how Rolu's image has gone from this of such a treasonous character to like, he's actually got his reasons and it makes perfect sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** It's so telling.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** It's crazy.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** It's so interesting.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:54]** It's almost like I always say the dice rolls tell the story, but we didn't intend for all these things to happen.

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:00]** Again, this was supposed to be a throwaway side session about Rolu giving a stone to Hears.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** A throwaway?

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:04]** When I first started talking about it, that's what it was.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** That's what you wanted it to be.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** So much more than that.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** You guys just take things so far and so deep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** It's like it's an interstellar tale from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** And I actually, I love it.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** I love all four of your characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** And it was unknown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** And it might have been called a treasure to some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Kelly, what was the real treasure along the way?

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** It was the puck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** It was the puck the whole time.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Yeah, it was the puck.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** I mean, actually, yeah, what the fuck, Kevin?

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** Wait, is there more to it than the puck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** Because there was no treasure for Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** The real treasure is Jack's crotch.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** That's exactly true.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Jack's cockies.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** That's actually how he ended the episode, was just like zooming in on his crotch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:53]** It starts suddenly glowing blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** Yeah, like, I don't really know.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:03]** I mean, maybe knowing who... For Thaddeus, it's like knowing who you're...

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** Sticking to your commitments, I guess.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** All of you.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** Like, you didn't do that.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** That's the only thing really Thaddeus learned, I think.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** And besides... Well, confirming... Let's talk to my commitment.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** From his perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:23]** I have a lot to say about the end of the show and Thaddeus, but we'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Fair enough.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:28]** You technically fulfilled your commitments, although that's a clause I wasn't aware about of the three captains.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** It's kind of weird.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** You could just leave the crew when you're on land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** That's what it says.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:41]** And for my sake, I posted the tenants of the free captains all over the place.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** It was on each one of your guys' notes.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** I put it several times in the chat.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** I put it all over the place so you knew what the free captain tenants are.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** I even had Will read them out for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** You know what's funny, Kev?

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** As Tremé, I think.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** I also mentioned that there was another cargo bay.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Like, I said it.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** That's a lie, though.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** That was a lie, though.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** I said that there was another cargo bay.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** And then, you know, it's just crazy how things happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** You know, you're like, oh, whoa.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** It always gets back to that other cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Yeah.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I still need that t-shirt.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** The other cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** That'll be in our merch for sure.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** We'll have the other cargo bay.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** We should have that.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** All right, so moving forward, we have the ship, we have the captain, now we have the crew.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:31]** And I started that first episode with you guys each telling me, you know, I introduced each of you and you told a little bit about yourselves.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:38]** We have Rolu, who is the chief of the boat, the Cobb, who's a new Cobb to the boat.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** And then we have Thaddeus, who's the weapons officer.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:44]** Chalk is still not a title for Chalk.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** He is kind of just the captain's plant.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Formerly.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Formerly.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** Formerly captain's plant.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, formerly.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:57]** And then we have Treme, who is the yeoman officer, the person in charge of personnel, essentially.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:01]** Those, again, I pulled all those titles from my experience on a submarine.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** And I was using the life aboard the Caduceus was a submarine.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Life informs art.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Right.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** But I had you guys just basically dropped off.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:15]** I was like, okay, the four of you are sent on a mission by the captain, given three words.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:23]** I don't have those written down right here, but it was basically find Otrulu, or kill Otrulu, find the riddle, and draw him out.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:28]** So using the riddle, you can draw out Otrulu.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** And I drop you into Kefaktipo.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:36]** And actually, I dropped you guys into Maro and made you drive into Kefaktipo because nothing can fly in Kefaktipo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:36]** Why is that?

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Allegedly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** I made that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Okay.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Yeah.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Cool.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** You wanted us to be on a bus, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** I wanted you to be on a bus.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** I didn't like the idea of you going to fly around.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** I just wanted something to be, there was something going on in Kavok Depot that prevented things from flying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** Just want to make our experiences uncomfortable as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:01]** But yeah, part of it was that it got resolved in the end, that very last scene.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** was Thaddeus watching a ship take off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** You jumping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** I'm jumping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** We'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** Right.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** But it was a rocket taking off, so I wanted to resolve that.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** So there was something holding everything down, and now it's released.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** What that was, that's open to interpretation.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** So you guys are dropped off in Morrow.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** You're bussed into Kefauk Depot.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** When you get to Kefauk Depot, the book is very open-ended.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** It's just like, hey, let them explore the town.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** And I was like, no, f*** that.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** I'm a first-time GM.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** You guys aren't exploring s***.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** And yet you still got fixated on the water dealer.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** I had to make a bunch of on the spot.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** Thank you guys for doing that kind of stuff.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:49]** But I finally was able to redirect you guys back to the riddle after I introduced you to the arena and I showed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Okay.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Frog.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:58]** If I might, as a player, like if you drop me into the desert and give me a character called the water dealer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** And asked me to pretend he's not a big deal.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:05]** That has to be... I think they are non-binary.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** That has Big Bad Evil Guy written all over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** I almost asked...

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** murk and catch that at the end.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** Hey, by the way, where's this water dealer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Let me put that to the camera for you guys.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** That's the water dealer?

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** That's the water dealer.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Beautiful artwork.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:25]** I'd have to look up exactly who drew that because it doesn't say on this page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Are they a nefarious character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:35]** They live in the desert and they control all of the water in Kefauk Depot.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** Think about that.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** You live in a waterless region

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** And water is life.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** And so they control that.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** Whether or not they're nefarious is to be told by the story.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** And I wasn't ready to go there.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** It had nothing to do with this adventure.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** So I didn't want to let you guys go down that route.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** And I had to very quickly revert you.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** I finally told you about a riddle, the riddle.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** And it turns out the riddle is not a, it wasn't a question.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** It wasn't some kind of trick.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** Riddle is a rat, a Yosuke, a character.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:12]** And that's actually how the book starts is riddles being beaten up in an alleyway.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** And you guys say, that's how the book starts.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** That's how I ran it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** I love it.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:22]** Lots of conversations about how much cover is provided by a vehicle in narrow alleyways.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:27]** And how much, how fast a vehicle can move in one action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:35]** Yeah, wasn't there something about how the vehicle just pulled up and then everybody just basically ran towards it?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** And then it pulled away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** Just some hand wavy, like, oh no, speed doesn't matter here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** We were like three episodes in at that point, I think.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** And you guys were like, that's not how GMing works.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** And I'm like, I don't know.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** In the book, the game doesn't have the car there.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** It just mentions the car.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** It says they run down the alleyway.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:59]** And I wanted it to be more intense, so I put the car a little closer and actually dropped it on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Yeah, it was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:02]** I enjoyed it.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:06]** I enjoyed you getting really angry about the fact that we were complaining about it.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** Right.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** It was really funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Thank you, Adam.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:16]** He's coming up late on the game, and he's going back and reading, and he's telling me that I was right in a lot of things.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** This is the way I got it.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** His messages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** Thank you, Adam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** I think for the most part, my goal was initially like, I'm going to stick to this book.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** I'm a new GM.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** I don't know anything.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** I'm going to play the book out by the book.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** But I was like, no, I want to throw in a little bit of flair.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** I want to make it my own.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** And that was the start of it.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** I added a car.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:40]** And when I had to get people in the car, I had to skip some rules and throw people in the car anyways.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** And props to you for doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** That was cool.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** It's really hard to just take a book and be like, I'm going to do it exactly as it is.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** I'm not going to change anything.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** And you were like, that's what I'm going to do.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** But then you found something.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** And then your brain was like,

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** I like that.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** That's cool.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** And you changed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** I got to say, Kevin, like I enjoyed that.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:05]** It's good that you did a lot of things that were kind of adding your own flavor, whether it's like new characters, new mobs, annoyingly.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:09]** And then like, but all this stuff, it's a lot to do.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:12]** I imagine for your first time as a GM to like add extra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** That's kind of cool.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** It was, it was a lot more than I expected on some scenes.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:22]** And I'm thankful again for our paralegals and finder and Adam were really helpful because they were like,

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:38]** willing to open junkers delight and give me insight on like hey i'm having a problem with this scene they're like what page of the book and would really like you know walk me through it but i still i put myself down some dark alleyways a couple of times but that's part of it you found your way out

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:44]** Yeah, and it was also tricky because I think the book kind of gives like three different options for how characters get dropped into this venture.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:49]** And you guys didn't necessarily fit into any of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Is that because we were pirates?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** I'd have to look up exactly what the three options were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:00]** I thought we would do a lot more piracy when you came to us and were like, we need to make a pirate crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:08]** I thought we would be sailing on ships, taking over some, taking some booty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** I agree with that.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:15]** The thing is like, yeah, you know, like Goldhorn probably did some piracy to get his initial control over this place.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** And we were like his crew that went in and fixed it.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Yeah.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:25]** Right, and honestly, I was leaving that super vague so that John could fill in the gaps if he wanted to.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:31]** But I have this idea for who Goldhorn is, and we'll see where that goes.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** The book has three different types.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:36]** There's discount treasure seekers,

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:39]** There are friends of the family, and there are looking for steady work.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** So the idea is that there's low-level characters.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:48]** The first one is like, hey, we're just going to go look for some treasure, and the junkyards of Kefauk Depot is a great place to do that.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:53]** The other one is like a friend of the family told you, hey, I need you to go look for this for my sake.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** which I think that's the one you guys fit into the most, the friend of the family being the captain.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:01]** And the last one was just looking for steady work, where going to Fock Depot, there might be something for you to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** Yeah, I could see why we don't drop in any of those super cleanly.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:12]** Kevin, was there in the story an actual treasure that's written in that because we're coming from a different direction, we didn't find?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** Or is it the drift thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** Oh, spoiler alerts if you're listening to this and you've never run or played Junkers Delight.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Stop now before I tell you how this goes.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** But yes, in the – well, no.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** In the book, it really goes by Vari.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:34]** Vari 13 is looking for information about the drift drive, and that drift drive exists, and it's on that ship.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** So we'll get to that later on about how the book diverts from –

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** Or how I diverted from the book.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** Cool.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** So at this point, you guys fought off the true warriors once.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** You saved Varya 13.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Sorry, you saved Riddle.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:53]** Riddle tells you about Varya 13 and says like, hey, she's been missing.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Logan?

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** Is that who he said his name was?

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** I forget.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Lorgan.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** It was Morgan with an L. Lorgan.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Not Morgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** Lorgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Lorgan, rest in peace, was made up by me.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** So...

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** In the book, yeah.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:15]** Again, we followed the book at that point and you guys got into another fight with the true warriors in the alleyway.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:20]** And that was pretty by the book until they ran away and got into the car.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** That was me.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Using my GM powers.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** And then you guys headed out to the car yards.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Car yards.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** Car yards.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Yeah, the car yards.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:36]** Getting into the car yards, it does talk about the guy with the K'vok dogs at the front.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Yeah.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** And it says he's basically an informant for the true warriors.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:47]** That first K'vok fight, I... Before we hop into that, can I talk about...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:54]** Can I ask about the choice to reveal to us as players things that we didn't observe?

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Yeah, this is crazy, Kevin.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Go ahead, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:10]** Because I found it really interesting because I, as a player, it was the first time I've experienced it where something that my player character didn't see was revealed off screen to me as the player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Like what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:16]** We moved on from the K'vok dog dude into the junkyards.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:22]** And then you very explicitly had a vignette of him pulling out his device to communicate to the true warriors.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Exactly.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** Hey, this is what's going on.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:28]** But we aren't supposed to know about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:34]** I mean, I'm a first-time GM, so I don't know what the norm is for GMing.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** There's no norm.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** It's whatever you want.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Right.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:39]** I was looking at this as like a... It depends on the game you want to play.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** Right.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:44]** And I was kind of playing this from like a movie perspective.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:47]** from what I understand of filmography and stuff.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:54]** And so it was like, yeah, you guys, the scene happens, we follow the characters away, but we're going to cut back to this detail.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** It was kind of how I played that scene.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** I like it.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Yeah, please.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:04]** Isn't there some discussion on the fact that we all rolled really, really high sense motive and other things like that?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** And then I think we also might've done a check on the person.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** I can't remember, but there were a lot of things we did.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** And you're like, oh man, you guys used all of those roles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** All of us thought he was shady.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** He's fine.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** That's not exactly what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** He was being straightforward with you that he's

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** I forget exactly how it goes.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** I'll have to go listen to the episode again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:31]** His actual occupation was selling Gafak dogs, which is true.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** He's also an informant for the True Warriors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:39]** Which we were specifically like, I wonder if he's an informant for the True Warriors.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** And then I think we rolled to that end.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** You didn't roll high enough.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** It was so high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** I'm a first-time GM, man.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:50]** I said that appropriately to what I thought was right.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** That DC had three digits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** DC45 for a K'Fok dealer.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Hey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:03]** Turns out that was actually Do-Trulu and using disguise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Just Do-Trulu with a mustache.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** That was a transformer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** All right.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** I'm sorry if I misled you at all with that scene.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** No, it was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** It's all right.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** It was a curious choice from my perspective.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** I don't know.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:23]** I've never been like, this is this thing that you now know, but your character doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** I like that idea of it.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:31]** I think it's a hard line to draw, but that's what I try to do, especially with Rick, where it's like, Kevin might know this.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** I told John this in a message recently.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** We've had a full year, because this game took so long, I'm sorry.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:46]** We had a full year to think about Threefold Conspiracy, and I was like, hey, I'm letting you know now, Rick trusts the stewards on that ship.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** But Kevin is super skeptical.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Kevin doesn't trust anybody.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** And this gate, like threefold conspiracy.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** F*** me up.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** I'm just going to say that.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** All right.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** So moving on from the K'Fox dog guy.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** I'm sorry about that.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** We get into the first fight with K'Fox.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** I was like, these K'Fox are too easy, man.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** They're only like six points of life.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** This fight is going to be nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Yeah.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:17]** This is the fight that never ends.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** And actually, I wrote out the equation for it.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:34]** It is the number of enemies, the total number of enemies is equal to the enemies that are written into the book plus one plus number of rounds divided by three minus the number of enemies killed because you have to account for that.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:37]** So basically, every third round, I added in a new K'vok.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** And I added one extra in the beginning.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** That makes sense.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Just because I thought they were too easy.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** And honestly, you guys didn't have a hard time with them.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** It was just a matter of getting rid of them and moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** It was more the emotional stress of not knowing how many more were going to show up.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Yeah.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** So it worked.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** It did what I wanted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** And then they turned out to be easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Yeah.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:00]** Which I love that in the end, there was like a swarm of them chasing you out.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** But we'll get to that later on.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** So you guys work your way through the car yards.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** You kill the K'Fox.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** You go digging through.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** You get up.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** There's that trap that you guys avoid the first time.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:15]** You get up to fight some more K'Fox at the ziggurats at the top, which are actually nests.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** And then...

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** You move around that corner and... Oh, at one point you found a dead body.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** I introduced all those extra footprints.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:29]** All of that stuff was mine.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** And no complaints to Jason Keeley, but in the game, the way it's written...

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:41]** the true warriors are kind of a threat at the beginning and then they kind of disappear for majority of the game.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** And I thought they just had to be more present.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Yeah.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** More present.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** And so I was like, Oh, I'm going to put footprints in there.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** I dropped dead bodies.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:52]** I made sure you guys spend a lot of times like investigating that scene and trying to figure it out.

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:00]** Um, and I wanted to make sure that it showed Varya 13 was with Lorgan on his way up and around, but they're being chased by true warriors.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** And so you guys figured all that out and worked your way around.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Um,

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:08]** And then you came up on that desert sea, the ocean of sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Yeah.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** And I just have to roll back to that.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** That, I think, is a great choice.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:19]** I think it's important to connect and tie things together that happened in the beginning.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** And also with the style, with the way that we play.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** We like...

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:33]** the small details that then matter, like that's how we're going to look at a scene because then it helps drive a lot of other conversations.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** So I think that was awesome.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** That was a great choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:51]** A little bit more of it too is that like your guys' motivations for Wiring Game, we talked about how like the four of you being pirates in this game, your job was to kill the true warrior's leader where the other written story arcs are not

**[00:29:51 - 00:30:15]** necessarily quite as intense so it is the true warriors are more of a nuisance to them where for you guys you needed to know that what you were doing was drawing them out the entire time and i think i thought that was important so i wanted to just reinforce that like oh no you're being watched they are following you like they have you in their sights and you're like working on pulling them out from you know the shadows so yeah

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** Yeah, we always talk about what's your motivation in this scene and staying reminded of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:26]** This is a big fail on my part, but so the Kefauk fight for everything it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** The Thastor Kefauk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** The Thastor Kefauk, yeah.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** It was a mutant K'fok that was actually only one.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** It wasn't a large creature because it only takes up five foot square.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:41]** It was a normal medium-sized creature because other K'foks are tiny, I think, or whatever, small.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** But I was like, oh, I wanted to make that introduction a minigame.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:49]** The idea was that you guys were playing almost like a battleship type.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:49]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:54]** You move across the desert and the square that was going to hit was moving.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** But my rolls took the K'fok up and to the left the entire time.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** And I was so mad about it, and I was just like, all right, they had to tax you, whatever.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** So there was that.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:10]** The radiation, I'm so mad at myself for, and I'm sorry you guys had to deal with that.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** You did great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** It was fine.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** What exactly happened to you?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Could you give us a summary of that?

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** The radiation rules were not accounted for, basically, right?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Or they were not accounted for properly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:24]** It was basically that environmental protection saves you from radiation, low-level radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** Low-level, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:38]** And all but one of you had that on, but it gave us such a hard time that first time we went through the fight that we basically just stopped the game and we're like, okay, next time we record, we're going to read this better.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** And we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** We had a conversation.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** We almost re-recorded it.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** It was a big conversation that we had.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** And we're like, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** It almost killed Torme.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:52]** We were all trying to figure out how to get in to rescue him.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:56]** We were trying to figure out how to kill this without getting radiation.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** And then we find out

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** you know, probably 80% through the battle that environmental protections would have saved us the whole time.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** So like, do we re-roll it?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:10]** Or do we, you know, show the community that, hey, we are indeed fallible.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** I mean, we're learning this game.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** We're learning this game just like you guys are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:18]** The community, like, they're so used to us being completely infallible.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** So then we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:26]** It's like half of the messages on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** Speaking of that, the Rules and Mistakes channel is very popular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** It's lit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:41]** To those who might not join us on Discord, we have an entire channel dedicated to rules we f*** up in this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:56]** Well, and that channel was lit up that day because we were talking about how Treme was down and the radiation starts – you take damage from radiation on the start of your turn, but then it's like when can you use resolve to stabilize and recover?

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** And so will the radiation kill him because he still has a sickness, but he's still in the radiation area?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** And there was all this debate, and I still don't know where I stand on that.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** I got to go and review it.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** But like delay –

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Is not an action.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Nowhere in the book does it say it's an action.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** I'm just going to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:15]** We were like... I remember this now.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:18]** That was delaying when you're unconscious.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** So it's like, I don't... That's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:26]** That's the difference is like per GM and per player.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** Right.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** That's a GM ruling.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** It's a GM ruling.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** I think it's still up for debate.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Is it?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Okay.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:44]** We decided we're going to keep going with this and release it and just fix the next episode and comment on it.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:50]** Because like, you know, we want to, re-recording it might have, we might have lost some of our energy and we don't want it to be fake.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** So we want to like put forward a genuine thing anyway.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Exactly.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** Yeah, no, we genuinely f***ed up that rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Yeah, we genuinely f***ed up.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** Don't worry, there's lots more of that in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:10]** I remember messing up the robot fight in book two and not realizing that y'all did three critical hits.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** I was like, oh, that's right.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** It's vulnerable to critical hits.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** This could have been over a lot longer.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** I think in the next episode, I was like, you take away your damage.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** You take away your damage because that's who we are.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** We'd rather be transparent about the rules and what we're messing up.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** You're at the table with us rather than...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:34]** Kind of like the DR on the Drift Phantom later on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Yeah, we'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:39]** Okay, so back to that desert scene.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:45]** So you guys kill the K'vok, you find the tanker, and there is Vahri 13 inside that tanker.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:50]** All of the flashbacks that Vahri has, those are mine.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I'll admit that.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** I wrote all those myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** They're like your flashbacks.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Like you were actually on those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Right.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I was, I was an alien Android.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** Um, yes, no, I wrote them is what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** Cause you're Rick 19 and Rick eight in real life.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** You are actually a murder bot.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** Rick eight was in the Navy.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** Rick 19 is just this iteration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** That's not how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** That's right.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** That makes sense to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:30]** So my idea with that, and this is kind of just jumping ahead with all of the cut scenes, was the idea that Vary 8 had the puck.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:35]** And for whatever reason, still not quite revealed, a gray...

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** came on to the Stellar Flare and tried to get that puck from them.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** And in the process, the ship was destroyed.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:55]** Fire 8 was able to put the puck in one escape pod, launch it, and then they launched out a separate escape pod and were knocked unconscious and then struck and killed.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:02]** And that's what caused the dead body to then be slowly over time turned into Varya 13.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:06]** Because Varya 13, Varya 8 was the eighth soul to inhabit that body.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** And Varya 13 is now the 13th soul.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:15]** And Varya 13 is having these flashbacks every time they have a life-threatening situation.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:23]** So I kind of had that whole story kind of figured out and written, and then I just chopped it up and put it in appropriately at different scenes.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** So that's where I introduced that.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:34]** And then, well, oh, and then you guys managed to avoid another trap, that same trap, when Varya 13 was supposed to be right under your tail, and you guys avoided that somehow.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** And that's when I was like, well, f***.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Yeah, by being too smart.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** That's a problem, yeah.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** And so I was like, well, what about the K'Vox?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** The K'Vox are coming.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:52]** Was that also when Rolu, you put in that thing that only Rolu would take damage from just trying to squeeze into a small space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Yeah, right.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Yeah, that's totally Kevin's fault.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** I don't recall this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** It's absolutely Kevin's fault that Rolu only rolled a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** Yeah, that's Cat's fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** I'm not even sure what you guys are referring to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** Multiple times would squeeze through small spaces and get f***ed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:18]** There was this one area by the east of the... No, west of the ziggurats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:40]** that was where you guys got like slashed and cut up yeah yeah no no roll well not you guys just rolu just me yeah because everyone else rolled at least like an 18 on the athletics check or whatever it was right yeah yeah yeah it's your classic ard your anti-rolu device and i i don't think i messed with the traps too much i left the traps as is because traps in starfinder are


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:38:06]** ridiculous and complicated so i was like i'm just as we found out once we got into the stellar flare yeah yeah you know yeah it's fine yeah like yeah so we got past the questions oh sorry no i was just gonna say dude there were multiple times where roly was squeezing through things and it just didn't work out for him like every time it's really sad yeah well the one time that i need that i needed it to was when i squeezed through the conversation to convince people so yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** To set your own trap.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Okay, I have to make this comment here.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** I was hoping to save it for the end, but I still don't know.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** We have finished the adventure.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** Like, done, tied up, buttoned, it's over.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** I still don't know if Chuck got screwed by Roller or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** I don't think you will know.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** That's for book three to tell us at some point, hopefully.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Maybe a different campaign.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** These are the things that will haunt my memories.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:41]** Anyway, Roller's squeezing through trash gets sliced up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** As Kelly, I'm happy that things ended the way that they did.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** Let's talk about the end at the end.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Let's get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:53]** You guys keep bringing it up.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** I know.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** I know.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** It's hard because the end was so amazing.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** I like the ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** It's fresh.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** So if we can pull the curtain back, we recorded the end today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Today.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** And we were like, we got to record plot armor now.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** And we're like, well, let's take an hour.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** But back to the...

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:16]** This, for me, was one of the first times where I was like... I mean, I was loving playing this campaign and being like, I'm a player for the first time in Starfinder.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** This is awesome.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** This group is great.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:26]** And then there was just something about the end of this act with us leaving that really just cemented for me us as a group on this mission.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** It made it real in my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** And what do you mean when you left this?

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:34]** Because the book just says, hey, on their way out of the car yards, check that trap.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** If they didn't trip it, you could try to catch them in it again.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** And that's it.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** That's all the book says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:39]** You mean the K'Fox trap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Yeah.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:44]** No, the bridge over the oil.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** And I was trying to catch you guys in it.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** And you still managed to get by it.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** So that's when you guys... Like, the K'Fox are chasing you.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** That's not a part of the book.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:57]** And you guys, like, set the C4 and blew up the bridge and all that craziness.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** And it was just like, boom.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** I forgot.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** So, like...

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:11]** I distinctly remember when I added those breaching charges to Chuck's inventory, I was like, this is going to be some tomfoolery.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** I'm going to be on some bullshit when I actually use this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** It worked.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** It was so good.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** I was just like, man, I don't know what the fuck's going on.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Go ahead.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Roll something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** It was the magic of the moment.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:33]** Like, because it was at that point, too, that, like, Thaddeus and, like, Treme, like, there's the personal conflict between players.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:40]** And then Chalk, like, that, I think, was one of your first times of just Chalking it up and just being like, I have these pressure charges.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** You know, you're like, I'm going to throw.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** And, like, the magic of, like, putting in the K'Vox chasing us, like, the tension.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** It was glorious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** It's why we play at that moment.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** We really did.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** In spite of the conflict, we were like, all right, cool, let's kick it into gear.

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:02]** You could see how the crew of the Caduceus, this 18 that was sent down, knows how to get things done and be a Caduceus unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:09]** Speaking of conflict, this is when we started introducing the Thaddeus-Rolu conflict.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** Thaddeus was suspicious of Rolu.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:18]** And so he had Torme get some information about Rolu's messages and start pulling that data.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:22]** And then, so Torme had like an insight of what was going on.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** You weren't quite, I don't know, leaning either way, right, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** Even as like a player, you just didn't know what was happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:37]** Well, I mean, behind the scenes, John and Kelly were plotting with Kevin this entire time.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** Not to my knowledge, really.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:45]** Still, I don't know the extent to which they have plotted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Or are still plotting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** But I was trying to think of like- We took an hour break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** That could have been a meeting.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Yeah, we had a full-on conversation.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** No, that's a part of how this was set up was like, we know it's about here's, and then we wanted to make-

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** we wanted to make Rolu suspicious and like lead into that.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** So we were talking about that and it's fun.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:07]** Cause like John and I have had a lot of conversations about like, I want to do this.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:14]** And he's like, and I want to do that, but we can't talk to each other about it because we don't want to spoil the end game stuff for either person.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** So it's been a lot of coded messages between each other about truth.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Right, because he's the GM of the main game, and I'm like, well, what about this part?

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** He's like, I can't tell you that.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** I still don't know what the puck is.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** I don't know what the f*** that thing does.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** I'm planning to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** I can share some things between Kevin and John, and some things only with John, and some things only with Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Yeah.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:38]** I just want to insert this comment, because we're on Zoom, and this is still an audio platform.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** John's game face over the last year...

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** He's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** He's just looking directly in the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:59]** Right into the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:02]** We could be knocking on the door of the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** We could be not anywhere close and none of us would have any idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** John's really good at keeping that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** It's like blind golfing.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** You swing, and you're like, how close am I?

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Hole in one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Don't worry.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:18]** There's plenty of scheming and side...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:47]** conversations for all of you to come in many things I think that was probably my favorite part about all of this was like the amount of creativity I was able to inject into running this game for you guys like playing the game was super stressful for me I'll be honest I have like 14 screens open and I'm like trying to juggle stuff and the rules on one page and I got the storyline here and I got NPCs but like all the prep work don't use Excel for initiative

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:55]** That's where I put all my notes so that way I wasn't juggling through the book for damage and stuff too.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** It worked for what it was.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:09]** Anyways, so out of the car yards, fantastic scene with blowing up the bridge and then you guys had that conversation about the messages from Rolu and off the ship to Shearer Dawnbreaker.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Did I get that right?

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:15]** And then you guys ended up facing Tez Tronin for the first time.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** That's right.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** That was not in the book.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** I introduced that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** And I wanted, again, the whole character wasn't even in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** No, Tez Tronin is.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:27]** Tez Tronin is the person who was in the car in the first place.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** She's in the book there.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:34]** And the next time she appears is at the very end when she comes into the Starfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** But that engagement was all homebrewed on your part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Right.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** But again, I think you guys were looking for Del Trollo.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** That was your whole purpose.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:47]** And so I wanted you guys to know that you guys were on their radar.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** On the trail.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** For the second in command to come out is a big deal.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** And then you guys talk down Michael.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** F*** you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:01]** So before we move on from test running, I think it's a really valuable mechanic that not enough GMs use.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:12]** Drop in a character, a sub boss, take a certain amount of damage and then let them retreat and leave the ads to take care of things.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:20]** Like I feel like the ominous nature of like they've experienced you and they know who you are and what you look like and they can disseminate that information.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** to the rest of the organization isn't nearly used as often as it should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** And I, this is me being a novice, but I was like, why isn't that done?

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** And so I was like, we need to introduce the bad guys sooner.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** And I had this whole thing written out and I had all these rules.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:38]** And then you guys turned around and like, you, you made her misfire.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** And then like, you guys took her down so fast.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** And I was like, man,

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:47]** Maybe I nerfed her too much for this scene that I was like, ah, well, but I did have that trigger point.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:52]** I always had the trigger point of she's going to do supernova blind you guys for half a second.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** The rest of true warriors disappear.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** And that's the end of that scene.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** That was the idea was like, I wasn't going to kill you guys.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** There was no plan to kill you at that point.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** Then when you guys ended that so fast, I was like, I'm going to kill these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Uh,

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** But we didn't know, right?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** That's the beautiful thing that like as a player, I'm trying to take back into GMing.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** It's like you just – you don't know.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:20]** Like it was like maybe this is when we fight Tez and then Tez got away and we're all about to die and then suddenly we're like –

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** Like, I have to take Tez out now.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** Like, there is a real hatred for Tez.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:33]** And it also works because the true warriors is its own boss.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** Like, they are a villain, right?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** Like, they're just a villain with many faces.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:42]** So then when you went through and were like, oh, so there's Dotrulu, you'll get there.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Instead, there's this asshole.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:59]** asshole who is who has it out for you and then blinds you and then leaves and in the first comp like in the first confrontation got like got you know was like in the car and then was like yeah nah y'all are y'all are nothing i'm gonna leave in the car


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** I'm kind of mad because I revealed the picture to you guys and you were like, oh, she has a glowing hand.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** She's clearly a Salarian.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** I was like, f*** me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** She had a f***ing lightsaber, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Yeah, she's a Salarian.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Cool.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** So you guys make it out of the car yards.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** You go back.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** You report all that.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:21]** You bring Vari-13 back to Riddle and Riddle's very thankful for you.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** And then Vari-13 tells you, hey, this is what I'm really looking for.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** And you guys are skeptical.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** You're like, we don't really care what you're looking for.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** We're only here for Dotrulu.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:41]** But I was slowly able to work you guys up and just convinced that if you followed whatever Vary13 was looking for, that Dotrulu would come.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:47]** And I think Will was probably the worst on it of like, why are we doing this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Worst or best?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Here's the money.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Just take some f***ing money.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** And the book actually says like, just pay him.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Just f***ing pay him.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** I think the book actually is the first.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** The only time the book cusses is right there.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** It says just f***ing pay him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Wait, wait, who?

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** We'd have a snake boy?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** I mean...

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** No, no.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:05]** Vary 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Oh, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** Trying to convince you to go to find the Stellar Flare with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Yep.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** I was like, I don't care about Stellar Flare.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Yeah.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Where's this Dutrolu, dude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** It was, it fits so well for Torme.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:23]** Torme is like, okay, but on the accounting, like, this is why we're here.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** And you're paying us for this.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** I have a checklist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Yeah.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Yeah, true.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** At which point Shaq was like, ooh, new and shiny?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:35]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** And then, was that also when we met Snake Boy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:43]** I think in that time I let you... Yeah, and that was all a mistake on my part.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** Why?

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** We got so many healing experience, John.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:53]** For letting you guys do anything... I give you guys one inch and you're like, we're going to take this to the moon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** But Snake Boy was so awesome.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** He was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:03]** Kev's definition of a mistake is us forcing him into roleplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** Yeah, that's very true.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Very true.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** I also just want to say, yeah, we all, that's a player favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** I had a fun time with that episode.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Yeah, it's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Kevin, Kevin.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:42]** kevin and john and whoever dms in the future i would not be opposed to kind of like in final fantasy how there's like a google every now and again that you can buy things from snake boy just shows up throughout the universe oh my god oh yes i really want that to happen and kevin has no it's like it's like the it's the jacket guy from um resident evil yes please would you like to look at my wares or whatever he says


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** He's also like the... You're like a Khajiit.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** The cabbage dealer from Avatar.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** You know, the cabbage dealer is just always in the way.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** Snake boy has ways if you have coin.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Yes, there it is.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:04]** So, as I was saying... I also have a note that is probably one of my favorite notes on our notes page, which is that in episode 19, it says, call a hotel.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:09]** And then in parentheses, it says, Thaddeus sucks at negotiating.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:14]** Yeah, it wasn't a successful one ever.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** All right.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Y'all in the background, I should just let him do it.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** That was cool.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** It was funny.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** It was funny.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** We managed to get Shaq in for free.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** You snuck a plant in.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** Good.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Congrats.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** It's just a plant.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:39]** So you guys took a rest out in town, and you guys got to purchase some stuff, and then you headed out into the outer junk fields.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** Is that where I'm at?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** Before we get there, drunk folks show up to the wrong room?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** What was the point of that?

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** To raise attention and have you guys freak out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** John knows the reason, apparently.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** No, I actually have been wanting to ask.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** I loved it.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** I like when you add suspense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** You were ready to shoot through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** It was good flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:14]** Well, like, it reminded me of that scene from Fellowship of the Ring where the Ringwraiths show up and, like, sword the beds in the wrong room.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Yes.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** After Frodo has moved and, like, just... Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** What's the point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** So much tension.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:25]** Like, they are there with pitchforks and torches ready to handle some shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:31]** And then they stab the bed, and then Frodo sits up, and then you hear the ringwraith screaming because it was further down the river.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** I know what to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Yes.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** I'll be honest.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** I didn't have any kind of plan.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** I had no plan for you to fight them.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** There was always de-escalation.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:46]** It was always just to build tension for a second and then take it away just to get you guys off your firm footing.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** But I think it worked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** I don't know how firm our footing ever was, but...

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** It always felt pretty sandy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** Benny, I'm going to boot you from this Zoom call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** you made your way into the junk outer junk fields.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** And, um, in the book, Vari doesn't join you.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** She's, they are not a part of that adventure.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:15]** And so I was like, well, I want Vari to come along because I need to give again, those opportunities for those flashbacks.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** And so I started writing those in like, Oh, there's, they're going to trip here and they're going to get attacked there.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** And they're going to do that.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:27]** So I was like, Oh, Vari is going to join until a certain point, which was hilarious when you guys were like, Oh, we're going to, you should come in the stellar flare with us.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** And I was like, no, please.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** No, no,

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** But, okay.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:37]** One thing I do have to point out is that in that part two, so there's three parts to this book.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** And in part two is the fetch missions.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** You go and find all of the components.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** I think in the book, there are five places you can go.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Four of them are required because you need to get four components.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I wrote those out.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:56]** I was like, I don't, I, again, from my experience with you guys at the marketplace, I don't want to give you any more than you'll take.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Um, cause you'll take it all.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** And so I was like, I'm going to, I railroaded you.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I railroaded you real hard.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:02]** I'll be honest.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** And I'm sorry to the listener for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** It didn't feel like it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:14]** I, I, I walked you through two of the, the, the scenarios first and then introduced you to, uh, cash and Merck cause cash and Merck were actually supposed to be introduced first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Can we take a half step back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:25]** Just thumbing through the notes on episode 21 where we find a hole with another faster toad and we pull the mind link circlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** That's in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** It's in the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** I'm pretty sure it's in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** I was really curious whether that was in the book or whether that was something that you added.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** I'll pull it.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Let me pull it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:41]** Because that mind link circlet, I feel like that changed how we handled the rest of the intrigue through the rest of the plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:50]** The ability to communicate non-verbally is so valuable when you're trying to do espionage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:50 - 00:54:00]** And we have communication devices, so you could still be at the Junkers Delight and Rulu could call and be like, hey, this is what's going on.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:08]** But this problem is a problem that doesn't exist in sci-fi that does exist in fantasy, which is like in fantasy, you can't just be like,

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Hey, what's going on?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** How you doing?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** And like text or do whatever.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Right.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:18]** So then now the nonverbal to like like communication is its own problem.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Yeah.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** It's so it's so much more important now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Nope, it says right there.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:33]** Treasures from that is if a character succeeds a 15% or DC 15 perception check while at the bottom they find 4,000 UPBs and a mind link circuit one.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** It says it straight out of the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Sweet.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Sweet.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:42]** And you guys, you're right because we even use that in the very last scene on the final episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** I'm using it all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:43 - 00:55:09]** right yeah oh yeah yeah so i think we so that i railroaded you a little bit i i walked you through the faster toads i that's where i introduced um another scene for vario 13 and then i forget the other one was the acestes i think i ran you guys through that one found out they spit blood through their eyes that's also from the book i i did not make that up i think jason keely was very proud of that moment uh he was the one that wrote that one in that's cool also i was gonna say that they're there we almost came we well hold on a second


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:14]** We almost developed a title called Take My Whole Dusty Toads.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** That almost became an episode title.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** It was so close, so good.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** I forget what it ended up being.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Take Me Home Dusty Toads or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Anyway.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Titles are always fun for this.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** What could have been, I guess.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** What could have been?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Probably would not be a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** There's a running gag that I have to have at least two drinks before I come up with a decent title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:41]** One, another thing with those, when you ran into them, um, I gave them magic missile.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:50]** They didn't have the ability for magic missile, but, but Treme being a witch word has a super cool ability to catch magic missiles.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:53]** And I was like, I gotta give, I gotta give Will the opportunity at least for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** That we only played correctly like once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Right.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** We f*** it up every time.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:03]** But I just thought it was just a cool scene for them to shoot a magic missile at you.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** I only gave them one each, I think.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** But yeah.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** Catch up.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** And then the goblins.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** So Merc and Kes, you guys met them.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:20]** And then you guys were given basically these fetch quests to gather all the components to make an EMP key that would help you get into the Stellar Flare.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** Which, again, you guys had a hard time of like, why are we going after the Stellar Flare?

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Like, what's the point?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:29]** But the point was to find something lucrative enough to draw out the true warriors.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** And you finally did go that route.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** I guided you.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** I said there was basically three places to go.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:38]** You had to get, I think, the Kestis, the goblins.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** And then there was where the junk golem was.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** And then there was one fourth area left.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:47]** That was where Zethelred's camp was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:48 - 00:57:00]** So before we go out on the fetch quest, that was an interesting point where after finding those two Akeshdi, the trying to solve things diplomatically was proven unsuccessful.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:08]** Like, I'm going to lay down all my weapons and we'll see if we can, you know, maybe exchange some information.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** And he was like, no, I'm getting out of here.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Peace.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:15]** It was interesting to establish different factions within the world, right?

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:20]** Because you would establish the true warriors as the local gangsters.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:27]** But I feel like it was coming out of that space that we finally established, okay, we've got the true warriors in town.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:34]** But out of town, there's a bit of a turf war between the unbrewed and the junk goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** The trash hunters.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** And that's out of the book.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** The big fight with Baumgasl and Asashla.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:45]** the, the Rivner that is, that is out of the book.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** I will get to that in a little bit.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:50]** Like I expanded that, but for the most part, that's how it's written is.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** And it's actually written as there are these two scenes.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** There's the scene with the goblins and there's the scene of the Kestis.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:01]** And depending on how those scenes end, it actually says if they attack them, it gives you a bonus here.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:05]** And if they attack these gives you a bonus there or disadvantage, whatever the case may be.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** It's written in the book.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:11]** What, what wasn't in the book was the goblins being so religious.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** I introduced that.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** I'm super proud of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Gold star.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:27]** I would never in my wildest dreams have imagined goblins as pious individuals, but wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** I love the idea of it.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:38]** I think the tower is there and they're in the region, but I forget exactly what the book says about the goblins, but basically you can talk them down

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:44]** But I was like, no, they have a reason for not letting you get to that item at the top of that tower.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:50]** And I then wanted, as soon as I decided to do that, I was like, well, what about the Junk Golem?

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** And I wanted to link this all.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** And so that's the connection between the Tinkerton

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Tinkerton is a made up name that I made.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:06]** So the junk golem being related to that tower and, and the goblins all having this like identity around Triune and praising this, this deity.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** And then all of that being connected to the gray in the end, which we'll talk about later on.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:11]** I wanted to do that.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** And this is where I started.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** So yeah, the goblins, the goblins religious connection to the junk golem.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** That's all on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:21]** Kevin, that provided so much for the story.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** Like that paid off over and over and over again.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Like, it was amazing.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Junk lords.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** I thought it was part of the story.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** It was so woven in.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** It was incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:36]** I'm deeply curious how this ties back to the Grey.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** Me too.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Wow.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** That's a shocker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** Fun fact, Grey is not anywhere in Junkers Delight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:47]** This is your story as much as it is Jason Keeley's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** Thank you, Jason, for setting the foundation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:55]** I just want to point out something that we as players completely ignored yesterday.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:06]** In episode 25, when Merc sends us on a mission to get on the fetch quest, they tell us that the murder bot is immune to magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Right.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Yeah.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** None of us remembered that.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** I think the book actually says that.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:18]** A lot of lines from Merc and Kesh were copied and pasted into my notes from the PDF.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** But...

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** One thing that wasn't in the Golem fight was just the Golem fight.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** And I introduced Zethelred.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** I added Zethelred in there.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:34]** I added the dead body against the console.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** I also added all the true warriors in there.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** And that was probably a little too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Kevin, it's time for you to write an AP, bro.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** It's time.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Yeah, bro.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** You're ready for it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Okay.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** We're only halfway through Plot Armor.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:54]** I'm going to have to create a bot that every time you say you're a bad GM posts.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Exactly.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Come on, dude.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Come on.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** I appreciate that.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:07]** Again, this is the part that I had so much fun with was like, oh yeah, they're going to do this and this and I can do this and this and like all the prep that I put into this.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:19]** That's what I enjoyed was like the writing aspect of it, which, you know, I have a creative side, but I was like, oh, Zethelred in the book, Zethelred literally falls into a crevice and dies.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:26]** And for me, that was so sad that Zethra Red was like this badass that had his own camp and then he turns around and dies.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** And I was like, no, I'm going to at least put him someplace important.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** And so I put him there and I was like, oh, I'm going to use him to draw you guys further into the combat.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** And it worked so bad.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** And it's just such a good way.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** You guys were like, oh, I'm going to go.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:50]** And all of you, I think the three of you, Torme, Chok, and Thaddeus ran over to the body of Zethelred, picked up his armor, his dashko, and his, I added in the glove.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** I think the, and I forget the name of the glove.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** El Jakarnam.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** El Jakarnam glove.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** Because I wanted to be able to give you guys stones and work with those.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** It was awesome.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** And the El Jakarnam glove was the only way to do that.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** So I was like, oh, Zethelred would have had something like that.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:15]** But I twisted it and said it was built by the goblins as opposed to by the greys from Threefold Concierge.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Anyways, cool.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** So good.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** Loved it.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** So the fight with the junk golem.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Yeah, that sucked.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** It sucks for everybody.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** It's immune to magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Didn't suck for Jack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Yeah, Chop was a baller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:32]** What I didn't expect is the true warriors to be so helpful for you guys.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:42]** Because I think actually that the true warrior that disappeared, who may or may not come back in threefold at some point to kill us all, I think he did the most damage on Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:42 - 01:03:12]** it was like two crits in a row wasn't it right yeah it was just lucky rolls that's just how the dice play out so this is where you start to see Shaq like his confidence start to blossom you know and then like he and then the insanity starts to as a result to take over the bloodlust well like from a character perspective and I feel like I've talked about this before Shaq was like always designed to be a support character

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:15]** He was never intended to live in the spotlight.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:24]** He was really like some sort of Venn diagram between Randall from Recess for the rest of you 90s kids.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:29]** The way he reports the progress back to the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** I hate Randall so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:31]** I love that.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:37]** And Jack the Monkey from Pirates, the Disney franchise.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:43]** So, like, when he hit the kill shot on Tinkerton, it changed everything.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:48]** His first taste, because up to this point, he's only ever been the captain's houseplant.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** That's why he doesn't have a rank on the boat.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:59]** So, like, his first taste of independence, he's finally seen his true potential in the field.

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Missed.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:05]** I won't say he's drunk with power, but he does realize that... Right.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** That certainly comes later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:14]** This feeds into it, because later on, when they're like, well, you killed Tinkerton, so you're a god, you were like, yes!

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** Yes, I am!

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Why not me?

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** But a little more about the Tinkerton fight.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** So you guys killed Tinkerton and you guys moved on.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** We were recording live at that time.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** I was, I was in California.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** It was actually last November, which is a long time away.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** I know it took forever.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** I'm sorry.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:33]** I asked, I talked to John, like how we're going to do this.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:40]** Cause I knew John Rolo needed, I put the stone, the puck, the object in Tinkerton.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** That was always my plan.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** And John didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** And you had it in Roll20.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]** In Roll20, the landing page, there was a blue shining light that you had for a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:52]** Oh, no!

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:57]** The cover of Junker's Delight is... I took that and put it on our landing page.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** It's a beautiful artwork.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:06]** Again, everybody who ever does any artwork for Starfinder, thank you, because it's beautiful and lovely.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:11]** But the drawing on the cover is the landing page.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:22]** It is the Junk Golem with, I called him Zethra Red, but it's actually supposed to be the iconic Vesk from the Starfinder universe.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** But I pictured that as Zethra Red.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]** Zethra Red was attacking this thing.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:30]** And so that's why I put it on our cover, but I dropped the glowing blue eye on it.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:35]** And because I knew from the beginning that I was going to put that stone somewhere in the game and that was a perfect place to put it.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:43]** And so when we got close to that point and John and I, John knew he was going to get the stone because we all know Rolu gets the stone.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:45]** And I kept telling John, like, don't worry.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** I got it.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Don't worry.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** I got it.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:46]** Don't worry.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:46]** I got it.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:47]** But I didn't want to tell him where.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:53]** And then finally, I think that episode came up and I was like, Hey, but by the way, like the stone's going to come up in this episode and you're going to have to get it.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:58]** So I need a way to tell you, I'm going to like cause a scene and make everybody leave.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:01]** I didn't expect to record that in person.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:08]** So I was like, oh, well, I'll just take our headphones off, and then John will be on, and then it'll just be the two of us talking, blah, blah, blah.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** But we were in person, except for everybody but Vinny.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** Sorry, Vinny.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:17]** We're at Will's house recording, and I was like, all right, everybody take your headphones off.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:25]** And I literally sat in the room by myself for 10 minutes while you guys all went upstairs and ate pizza, and I was starving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Yeah, we ate without eating pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:34]** You had said to me, just do this and we'll record it later.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:39]** And so I just didn't know what was going on, but I was like, all right, I'm supposed to leave the room and figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:45]** So we ended up recording it after the fact and then inserting it into the show prior to release.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:49]** So that scene did not get added until later.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:52]** And I was hungry and hangry by the end of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** And then you got to eat some pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:57]** And then, yeah, then you get a tasty pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:02]** It wasn't until this exact moment that I realized that that was the stone.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Yes, and this is another thing.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:06]** I thought that I stopped glowing because we killed Tinkerton.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Like, that was just part of its circuitry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:14]** No, it's... Yeah, so just for the listener, on our landing page, I added the eye.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** I added a glow to the eye.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:21]** And after this episode, I took the glow away and covered the eye with a black hole as if...

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:26]** It was dead, but like we just said, in my view of this, it was the stone the whole time.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:35]** So the idea is that, and we'll get into this a little bit later, but the Grey created Tinkerton to find the stone and bring it back.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:42]** The problem is, is back to the Stellar Flare, the Stellar Flare is broken up across the junkyards.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:50]** And where you were in the fight with the Tinkerton was on the bridge of the Stellar Flare.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** At least in my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:54]** That's why the controls with Zethelred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** Right.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** And that's why Tinkerton ended up there.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** Because Tinkerton went back to the Stellar Flare.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]** It was just not the Stellar Flare that the Grey was intending.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** At least that's how I wrote it.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** That's in my mind.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** That's what I had going on.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** It's awesome.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** That's spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:10]** It's fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** That adds up.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:20]** Just one more thing about that scene was that I had Chuck, I had Vinny roll to see if he saw Rolu, and he did.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]** And so we also recorded that separately, I think, about –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Basically... Right.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** That was like an aside.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** Like, hey, by the way, you rolled... You saw Ralu grab something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** Something.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:33]** That was also when you had the interview.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:33]** Right.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** Where you were like, hey...

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:41]** we should have Thaddeus and Rolu interview with Goldhorn, which was an awesome vignette.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:44]** We haven't talked about that at all, but I love all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** I was waiting to get back to that, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:54]** And I think our fans liked it too, where we would take, instead of doing our introductions, we would do asides of our characters on the ship.

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:01]** And what we did was basically a documentary show where we interviewed each of you.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** And I thought it worked out really good.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:09]** It was also a lot of good spots to introduce things story-wise that I wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:15]** Which included, was that one Thaddeus called himself the big hearted kitty catty?

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** I think it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:20]** No, I think you're talking about the cuddle puddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** Oh, wait, no.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** Maybe it was the cuddle puddle.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** This only gets better.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** What are we saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:53]** they're they're just those like interview moments with the crew that was interviewing the crew of the caduceus like the film crew for the show that took on a life of its own and just yeah y'all just did like an incredible job bringing out so many sides of your character that you wouldn't normally get to see you wouldn't have the space for it it was great i remember being supremely nervous because like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** None of this was scripted.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]** None of this was discussed in advance.

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:06]** It was just like, in the moment, Kev would pick one of us to pick on, ask a bunch of questions, and you better have an idea of your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** You better know.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:13]** That was almost payback, I'll be honest.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:13]** Oh, yeah?

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Was it now?

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** Good old plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:19]** Now I get to ask the questions.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** But I loved it.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** They all turned out really great.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** Every time those episodes came up, it was a lot of fun.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:30]** And actually, the characters I had to develop, the interviewer was a character of his own.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:31]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:35]** And there was that side character way later.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:39]** I forget what his name was, where Thaddeus is hugging him or brofisting him.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:39]** George?

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** George.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:42]** The boom operator, right?

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:44]** Yeah, I can look him up.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** He's in my notes somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:48]** He was a G, whoever he was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:54]** And you invited him to be a free captain at some point, I think, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:58]** Maybe he'll replace some of our fewer members of our crew now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** Yeah, there's a lot fewer now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:08]** That was also when we established that Kasothans dip their hands into someone else's drink when they first agree to a contract.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** I forgot that.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** It's canon now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** It's canon.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** Yeah, it's just Paizo lore.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** I forget where we were.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** Where were we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:21]** We were talking about... Oh, the intro between... Yeah, we just killed Tinkerton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** Yeah.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:25]** So you killed Tinkerton and you came back.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:27]** I think you saw Goblin run away.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:31]** And honestly, the reason I introduced that Goblin was because...

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:36]** I wasn't sure if you guys would roll high enough to see Rolu take the stone.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]** And you, you did.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** I misheard.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:41]** That's what happened.

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:46]** So I misheard Vinny say his role was high enough in the game.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:52]** And when I went back and listened to it, Vinny was like, Oh, I rolled a 32 and I only heard three or something like that.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:57]** And I was like, Oh, so nobody saw anything, but Rolu saw a goblin run away.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:59]** So that was just to distract you guys.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:01]** And then all of you were like, Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:23]** it was something important that goblin was something or something and i was like no and that's when we went back and recorded the chalk conversation where he saw so like from from the audience this was like four weeks later i get a dm from kev saying oh by the way chuck did pass hey what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:25]** I need you to say this, this, and this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:26]** Yeah.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** Yeah.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** Hey, you definitely passed this roll.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:33]** So you saw Rolu do this, that, the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]** Yeah, because I wanted Choc to also be aware of that in-game.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:47]** Choc being almost like a side character, but he's so much more aware of everything than people let on.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:56]** And I think it was, one of you guys pointed out, your intonation when you're playing Choc changes when you're talking to the captain versus when you're playing in-game.

**[01:12:56 - 01:13:01]** When you're talking to the captain, it's more proper and more uplifted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** Oh yeah, probably.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:08]** I'm actually curious to hear more of that because I don't do it intentionally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:10]** Again, you're just getting into your character.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** Yeah, you're just having your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:22]** I have to say, this is... What's really funny is when Kevin and I had these sidebars, it was like, when is this going to come up?

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:24]** When is Jack going to reveal this to the rest of the

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:27]** of the cast up to the rest of the crew.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** And it was in the moment.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:38]** Uh, and I, I think we'll get to it in about 10 or 15 more episodes where like we start to pick pocket Rolu while he's sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:40]** And I wasn't sure when that was going to pop up either.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:43]** And I didn't expect you to say it at that time.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** And I did.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]** And nobody picked up on it.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** Nobody.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** But I did.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:50]** I was like, yes.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:52]** So good.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:54]** Say this again, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:58]** We'll get there in about 15 episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:01]** I just want to add to that.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:09]** I think it was at this time that Torme and Thaddeus, like, getting the documents, that was from before.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:14]** But there was something else here that was going on that was, like, really great.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Do you want to talk about that?

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:16]** No?

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Don't remember.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Are you talking to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:20]** Yeah, I was talking to you in the voicemail.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:26]** Are you talking about the asking Treme to pull that data, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:30]** Yeah, but you asked earlier, but then it took a while for it to come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:38]** Well, you got it back, and then you finally were able to sit down and read it, I think is where we were at this point.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:53]** yeah and and termay you you read it but like you still didn't get it you were like they're just talking about a bunch of t-shirts they're like what is this i don't know but thaddeus is like no i know this is something i got this this is i know this is damaging and you're like termay was like i don't know i'm not seeing it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:55]** I think at this point... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:55 - 01:15:00]** Yeah, I was just going to say, Thaddeus tells... Because we'll lose over somewhere doing something suspicious.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:11]** And then, like, Shaq and Tremé are here, and Thaddeus is like, look, this is your... Like, he says something about how, like, I'm sure that...

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:16]** Wait, wasn't the Heroes poster revealed at this point, or was that later?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** I think so.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:25]** I think it was right around the Tinkerton kill was when you guys finally got the message that Heroes is a wanted criminal, according to the Free Captains.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:25]** Heroes Fabricius.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:28]** Wanted dead or alive for treason against the Free Captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:37]** So that's the first time that Thaddeus basically says to the group openly, minus Rolu, like, Rolu's like, you got to watch out for this guy.

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:40]** Because he was, he already knew he was on his ship and stuff, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:43]** I'm curious, what did you guys think at this point?

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:49]** Because again, I wasn't revealing too much to you as players, Vinny and Will.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:54]** John and Kelly knew this was coming, but you two didn't.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:59]** So when I dropped that poster on you, I was like, we'll see how this happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:05]** Okay, so this is a conversation that John and I actually had this morning.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:08]** Is this poster...

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:18]** Is this notification like, and this is really sad, so I hate to compare it to this, but is this like an Amber Alert we get on our phone a couple of times a week?

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** I would say no.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:28]** Or is this like once a year, once every five years, someone has wronged the free captains enough that this is like an APB for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** I think it's more of an APB.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:36]** It is a fleet-wide, hey, this guy is a f***ing traitor message.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:39]** That's why it was blasted to everyone.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:40]** Even Rolu got that message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:44]** Because culturally, this is exceptional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:45]** Yeah, it's a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** I think it's a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:47]** Yes.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]** Before that...

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:53]** I just liked how Thaddeus was, like, the driving, like, there's something up.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:57]** Like, there's something here, and you should pay attention.

**[01:16:57 - 01:17:05]** And especially Torme, you just had this great reaction, which is, like, starting to introduce the different perspectives, as Kelly and I have talked about.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:09]** Like, the perspective from Rolu and the perspective from Thaddeus.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:12]** And Torme, you just had this, like...

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:14]** You were like, sure, I'll look into that for you.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]** That's kind of odd, but that's what I do.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:19]** So I'll do that for you.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:25]** And then even when you gave it to him, and then even when he said it, and then even when he holds up the poster, you're like...

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]** I think I'm starting to put it together.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:29]** You played it perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:33]** The skepticism was valid for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:34]** What did you think?

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:46]** My skeptical attitude I sort of brought into Terme as trying to be the broker between members on the ship and different interests on the ship.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:53]** What I imagine the yeoman has to take a very bureaucratic, detached look.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:57]** from the rest of the crew, perhaps.

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:04]** And so I think for me, also didn't want my character to necessarily pick a side yet.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:26]** didn't want to it was awkward for me i'll be honest to try and play it because i wasn't like i know where it was going to a degree like obviously i didn't know to what extent but i wanted to see how far it would go before i would have to make it

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:28]** that sort of call, that decision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:29]** That makes sense.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** That's probably wise, actually.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:34]** Another point for Tremé's wisdom, to be honest.

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:45]** I was going to say, you all don't know until later, and we'll get into this, that Thaddeus already was put on this ship so that he could keep an eye on R'lyeh.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** So there was already stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:51]** Even Jon didn't really know that until this last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:55]** But anyway, we'll talk about that as it comes up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:56]** Yeah, we'll talk about it.

**[01:18:56 - 01:19:02]** And I was just going to say, I really like that Terme played that.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:05]** Because you already have Thaddeus and Rolo.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:06]** So it's like two sides of an extreme.

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:06]** Cool.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:08]** They're setting up a conflict.

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:11]** And then you have Chak, who's blossoming into this wild thing.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:18]** And then Terme, you were the important... And we'll get to it at the end, but it's like, if you hadn't...

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:22]** Like, if Chalk hadn't convinced you, things would have gone differently.

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:23]** Like, right?

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:27]** Like, you were the important piece there for things to move that they did.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:30]** Like, that was the final domino that needed to fall.

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:31]** If that didn't happen, it was going to be different.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:35]** And to your point about the being awkward, like, I get it.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:44]** I think it's just us all being transparent with each other, very clear about what we're okay with, especially when it comes to, like, this kind of interplayer conflict that bleeds into your characters.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:46]** Like, we've all...

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:52]** Behind the scenes, we're all transparent and open and checking in and making sure it's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:57]** To be abundantly transparent, I still don't know if Jon f***ed me on that.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:04]** It must be said.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:05]** It has to be said.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** We'll get to that in a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:07]** I can't wait to get to it, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:15]** An ideological diamond where we've got Thaddeus on the left, we've got Rolu on the right,

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:18]** Termanin is our anchor on the ground.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** Yeah.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:23]** And Chak is just up in the clouds doing whatever the f*** he wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:26]** Doing whatever Chak does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:34]** And as a GM, like... Which is hilarious to me because, like, we've talked so many times about how terrible mechanically the makeup of our party is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:36]** Right.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** Not missing a lot of things.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:39]** Oh, sure.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:41]** Only one person can have medicine, computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:44]** One person can do medicine and computers.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:45]** We have no tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:48]** Somebody had, like, a 10 in piloting for no reason.


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:49]** That was me.

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:51]** Because we were pirates.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:53]** Yeah, because we were pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** I fully expected to pilot a craft at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:57]** Yeah, I was expecting that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:07]** But like the intrigue and how we melded as a crew was always really entertaining to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:07]** And this is me.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** I'm guilty of this.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:11]** And I'm sorry, Will, because you were the experiment.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:14]** I had Rolu I know.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:15]** I know Rolu.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** I know where he starts.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:18]** I know where he ends.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** And then I have Thaddeus who's chasing Rolu.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:23]** So there's clear opposites.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:24]** And like you said, there's a triangle.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:26]** Then we have Chak, and I know Chak.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:31]** Chak is Goldhorn's plant who's now getting out and experiencing life for the first time.

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:33]** But it's Treme.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:34]** Treme was the unknown.

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:37]** And I was so – every time one of these like –

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:39]** one of these pivot points came.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:42]** I had no idea how you were going to respond, but that's the experiment.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:45]** It was, you knew nothing going through this entire game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:47]** I really didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:50]** And every time it came up, I was just like, what is he going to do?

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:52]** And I was just like, I'm watching you.

**[01:21:53 - 01:21:54]** Like, oh my God, how is he going to respond?

**[01:21:55 - 01:22:01]** And I think like, I think how Torme responds is almost how the listener is probably responding to all these.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:03]** Yeah, I think Torme was the Greek chorus of this drama.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:03]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:05]** Yeah, you were the Greek chorus.

**[01:22:05 - 01:22:07]** You were the barometer for the bullshit and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** I love him for that.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:09]** It's so good.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:13]** And I'm sorry that you were, you had to fall into that position, but you did wonderfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:17]** Happy to be experimented on.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:18]** I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:27]** Can you say that again into the mic so I can just know that for future reference so you can scrape this audio?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:29]** Yeah, I'll scrape it.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:31]** So much by John.

**[01:22:31 - 01:22:33]** Yeah, it's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:36]** Okay, so you guys finish your tasks.

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:38]** You go back to Merc and Kesh.

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:39]** You tell them, hey, we found other parts.

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:40]** Get us into the Stellar Flare.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:43]** Varia 13 is still with you during all of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:47]** Kevin, are Merc and Kesh, like, did you already determine that they were together?

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:49]** Or did you just, like, you know, under pressure at the end?

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:51]** You're like, nah, they're together.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:54]** Were they together from the very beginning in your head, in your canon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:55 - 01:22:56]** No.

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** So in the book, they're just friends.

**[01:22:58 - 01:22:59]** Okay.

**[01:22:59 - 01:23:01]** And they're kind of described that way.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:04]** As for the relationship between them, I think like –

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:15]** It was John's, like Rolu's relationship to the other Keshti that kind of led to letting Merc and Kesht kind of blend closer.

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:16]** I like them.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:18]** I like the idea of them being a pair.

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:19]** Yeah, they're a good couple, I think.

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:21]** I shipped them for you.

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:22]** Yeah, you shipped them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:22 - 01:23:23]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:23]** Good.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:23]** I do.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:28]** So I felt like it was really interesting what felt like early on.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:36]** And I wasn't sure if it was a security blanket or if it was an implied romantic interest between Very Thirteen and Rolu.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:40]** You guys didn't see.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:43]** Jon was like, whoa.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:46]** I've never seen your eyes that wide in 30 something years.

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:49]** I was like, okay, cool.

**[01:23:50 - 01:23:52]** I think Choc would be really interested in Merc and Cash.

**[01:23:53 - 01:23:56]** And like, what would a throuple look like in this context?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:56 - 01:24:01]** There was like a Choc Merc thing going on for a little bit too, which we never got back to.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:02]** We never did.

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:03]** And that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:04 - 01:24:06]** We'll get to the back end of it as we get to later episodes.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:07]** Go ahead, Kelly.

**[01:24:07 - 01:24:10]** Is Rolu interested in... What's his name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:11]** Quartle?

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:11]** Quartle?

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:12]** Quartle?

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:13]** Quartle?

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:13]** Quartle?

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:14]** Yeah, 100%.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:15]** Oh, okay.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:17]** All right, cool.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:18]** I'm just making sure.

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:19]** It's good to know.

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:20]** I ship them, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:20]** Cool.

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:27]** Okay, so you guys head off to the Stellar Flare itself.

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:28]** You brought everything.

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:30]** You're like, hey, this is all the parts you need.

**[01:24:30 - 01:24:31]** We're like, cool, I got the parts.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:34]** We can make a bomb because that's what people do.

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:37]** And you make your way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:41]** It just takes bare parts and make bombs.

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:43]** Yep, that's what everyone does, Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:45]** So then you go to the Stellar Flare.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:56]** And again, I think the Stellar Flare, I forget exactly how it's written in the book, but I added that religious tone to it, that it is some kind of temple to the trash hunters.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:58]** But it meant nothing to the Akestis.

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:01]** I kind of wanted to add that in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:11]** So the Akestis, because right after we hopped in, we saw the two, well, one, we had a really fun rude awakening with that f***ing turret.

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:12]** Sorry.

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:14]** After we got past that, that was a terror.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:15]** Okay.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:17]** Anyway, we'll get there.

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:17]** Yeah.

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:24]** Finding the two Keshi that just teleported in and were immediately mowed down by the same fucking turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:25 - 01:25:28]** Like that, that conflict.

**[01:25:28 - 01:25:43]** the turf war between the Keshti and the goblins was really personified in that single, like, okay, the goblins claimed dibs because they had the know-how to get in, but also the Keshti were there first.

**[01:25:43 - 01:25:51]** And that like how much of this you made up and how much tension it created is wildly impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:58]** So I think I just dropped you onto the page on roll 20, just so you can see, this is the actual size of the map.

**[01:25:58 - 01:25:59]** The book is given.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:59 - 01:25:59]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:00]** It's tiny.

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:02]** And this I'm angry about.

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:05]** This is my biggest complaint about this book is the mid zone is too small.

**[01:26:06 - 01:26:07]** So I actually sized this up.

**[01:26:07 - 01:26:10]** I think, um, what is, I forget what it is.

**[01:26:10 - 01:26:11]** I doubled it at least.

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:12]** Um, if not,

**[01:26:12 - 01:26:12]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:26:13 - 01:26:15]** And you made it one square is like 20 feet or 10 feet.

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:18]** Because you set up a literal turf war.

**[01:26:19 - 01:26:20]** A literal turf war.

**[01:26:20 - 01:26:28]** And in the book, it is bomb gozzles on one side, a social is on the other, and you guys in the middle, and you guys are fighting each other.

**[01:26:28 - 01:26:32]** There is a rule in the book about you can roll diplomacy to get them to attack each other.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]** But I was like, no, we need more.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:39]** So I added in the Kestis on one side and the goblins on the other.

**[01:26:39 - 01:26:41]** And I had them fighting each other.

**[01:26:41 - 01:26:45]** I think it mentions them kind of in the background in the book.

**[01:26:45 - 01:26:47]** They're supposed to be like, oh, they're on the sides.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:49]** But the fight is just the three of you.

**[01:26:49 - 01:26:53]** It's your group and the two big bads.

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:58]** But let me take you now from what you see now on the map, which is small.

**[01:26:59 - 01:27:03]** I dropped you into, where's the other mid zone?

**[01:27:03 - 01:27:04]** This scene.

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:05]** I was trying to draw.

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:06]** So I turned it.

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:10]** I also turned it because the stellar flare is set where the door is to the south.

**[01:27:11 - 01:27:15]** So I rotated the mid zone so that it would be the same orientation.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:16]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:19]** And then I, then I just expanded that, that page up.

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:26]** And when I did that, I was able to add in all the extra goblins and Akestis, but I only wanted the background.

**[01:27:26 - 01:27:35]** So I didn't want them to be actually a part of the fight, which is hilarious because I think it was Treme who was like, I want to kill all the goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:27:36 - 01:27:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:37 - 01:27:38]** And he started targeting them.

**[01:27:38 - 01:27:39]** And I was like, no, you can't do that.

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:40]** You can't target them.

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:41]** And you were like, why?

**[01:27:41 - 01:27:42]** And I was like, please don't.

**[01:27:42 - 01:27:45]** I just, I didn't, I didn't account for this.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:48]** Yeah, so you guys – so I dropped you into the mid zone.

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:50]** I gave you that big fight.

**[01:27:50 - 01:27:56]** It has a little play, but I was able to – like I let you guys talk down Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:57 - 01:27:59]** You let us try to talk down Bomb Gozzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:00 - 01:28:01]** Asashla was always going to die.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:02]** I believe it says that in the book.

**[01:28:02 - 01:28:09]** I think Bomb Gozzle – I forget exactly what it says in the book about whether or not you can – basically once he's down, he runs away.

**[01:28:09 - 01:28:10]** Like he's out of his armor.

**[01:28:10 - 01:28:12]** He's got less strength, whatever.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:12]** He runs off.

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:15]** But I was like, no, you guys can communicate with him.

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:19]** And that's when Rolu kicked him in the ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:28:19 - 01:28:23]** Well, so Rolu didn't kick him in the ass until after the conflict was resolved.

**[01:28:23 - 01:28:40]** What I thought was really intriguing, and I thought was a really interesting take on Turf Wars, was we had not a single... Because usually, especially in tabletop realms, you've got a really clear villain.

**[01:28:41 - 01:28:42]** You've got a really clear hero.

**[01:28:42 - 01:28:47]** And your villain and your hero duke it out on the field of battle.

**[01:28:47 - 01:29:13]** until one of them wins so like i felt like this was a much more accurate representation of what conflict really looks like you've got factions that you really have no influence on on the map fighting each other we had we had factions of goblins and factions of a keshi that were in very clear open you know firing shots at each other we had a sashla who was just like

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:18]** wrecking goblins and Akeshjis alike, Akeshjis that weren't necessarily following her orders.

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:30]** We had Bomb Gozzle in this really sort of cobbled together suit of armor who was monumentally pissed at Chalk for killing Tinkerton.

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:36]** Another nod to your religious, to the pious nature of goblins in this universe.

**[01:29:37 - 01:29:38]** Yep.

**[01:29:38 - 01:29:43]** And like how real and how lived in this world felt at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:44 - 01:30:09]** might have been the most lived in of just about any world that i've i've been in a tabletop experience i i have to thank chalk for that like it was funny because all of you i think termay took the lead on saying like hey let's let's talk this out like we believe in the same god that you do um and then chalk rolled a wisdom save it was like no that i killed him i'm the king it was


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:12]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[01:30:12 - 01:30:13]** It doesn't end there.

**[01:30:14 - 01:30:15]** Because I almost forgot about this.

**[01:30:16 - 01:30:22]** This was when Chuck doubled down on the, I'm receiving a message from Triune.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:30:22 - 01:30:26]** I remember that.

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:28]** Like, we all broke.

**[01:30:28 - 01:30:31]** We all broke so quickly with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:31 - 01:30:31]** It was amazing.

**[01:30:31 - 01:30:32]** It was so good.

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:34]** It was so good.

**[01:30:34 - 01:30:36]** It was like a top three moment of the entire show.

**[01:30:37 - 01:30:38]** Absolutely.

**[01:30:38 - 01:30:39]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:39 - 01:31:04]** you guys so you could finish that fight Sasha Sasha died some cats she's had some goblins died bomb guzzle broke into pieces and turned out it wasn't Bob guzzle it was bomb guzzle and two other goblins in three three goblins in a mech suit perfect I just want to personally thank Kev for making that happen I was asking for three goblins in something for months this is perfect I'm gonna make this happen true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:05]** It literally changed to the night of.

**[01:31:06 - 01:31:08]** And then you guys took camp there.

**[01:31:09 - 01:31:13]** And during the camp, I put you guys in the watches and I randomly coupled you with different characters.

**[01:31:14 - 01:31:16]** Those scenes turned out... Again, this is just me f***ing around.

**[01:31:17 - 01:31:20]** I'm going to give you guys a second chance to just improv it out.

**[01:31:20 - 01:31:23]** And Choc, you had a whole...

**[01:31:24 - 01:31:26]** Let's go knock on the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:31:26 - 01:31:28]** Well, like, okay.

**[01:31:28 - 01:31:30]** It was right around Halloween.

**[01:31:30 - 01:31:33]** So, like, I had just done the whole trick-or-treating thing.

**[01:31:34 - 01:31:38]** You know, my wife took the kids to get candy, and I was the one to stay to the house and hand stuff out.

**[01:31:39 - 01:31:41]** You know, whatever happens, happens.

**[01:31:42 - 01:31:44]** I will neither confirm nor deny that happened.

**[01:31:44 - 01:31:46]** But, like, yeah.

**[01:31:46 - 01:31:48]** Only two people you know.

**[01:31:49 - 01:31:51]** Why not ding-dong-ditch

**[01:31:51 - 01:32:13]** a sacred monument right what's the worst that could be in there he said sheepishly yeah oh the confidence of youth in hindsight like this rudabaga had no idea that they were drift dead that could have answered the door right but yeah why not just like

**[01:32:14 - 01:32:15]** Knock, knock, knock.

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:18]** What happens, happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:18 - 01:32:20]** That turned into such a cool scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:20 - 01:32:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:22 - 01:32:24]** But I gave each of you that opportunity.

**[01:32:24 - 01:32:29]** And then I was literally rolling randomly about whether or not you would see something.

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:33]** And it was for Rolu that I added in the pterosaurs.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:37]** And pterosaurs are an actual character from one of the alien archives.

**[01:32:38 - 01:32:44]** And I was like, oh, I wanted a creature that was large and intimidating that could fly.

**[01:32:44 - 01:32:45]** But that didn't.

**[01:32:45 - 01:32:48]** I had to ground them because nothing flies in K'vok.

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:49]** I had to reinforce that.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:52]** And so I was like, I'm going to make these pterosaurs walk across the desert.

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:57]** But I was fully ready for you guys to fight these things.

**[01:32:57 - 01:33:03]** I had stat blocks and everything, but Rolu chickened out and just let them walk by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:06]** Did I chicken out or did I just make a tactical call?

**[01:33:06 - 01:33:26]** No, I mean it was a cool scene and I'm always a fan of the tension that happens and then just like with the people knocking at the door and then you're waiting for it to happen and then it doesn't because there was already enough that went on with just that whole fight that we didn't need that.

**[01:33:26 - 01:33:28]** We didn't need that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:28 - 01:33:29]** And I thought that was good.

**[01:33:29 - 01:33:30]** I think it was a good resolve.

**[01:33:30 - 01:33:33]** Like it was just enough tension in the middle of the night to keep going.

**[01:33:33 - 01:33:41]** And I think this goes back to playing D&D with you guys where it was every time we went down for a nap, somebody had to wake us up for combat.

**[01:33:42 - 01:33:45]** And there are rules to like random encounters and all that fun stuff.

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:47]** And it's fun stuff.

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:50]** I hate being woken up in the middle of the night, period.

**[01:33:50 - 01:33:51]** That's all.

**[01:33:51 - 01:33:51]** That's all.

**[01:33:53 - 01:33:53]** Cool.

**[01:33:53 - 01:33:57]** So we woke up the next morning and we were like, hey, let's go into the Stellar Flare.

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:59]** That's when shit hit the fan.

**[01:33:59 - 01:34:01]** Stellar Flare was intense.

**[01:34:02 - 01:34:04]** We'll talk about how much I changed on it.

**[01:34:04 - 01:34:05]** I really didn't change all that much.

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:08]** That trap was legit.

**[01:34:08 - 01:34:09]** The turret was legit.

**[01:34:10 - 01:34:13]** In fact, the only thing that wasn't legit was how easy it was to stop.

**[01:34:13 - 01:34:15]** Is it because we did awesome?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:34:15 - 01:34:17]** I don't remember it being easy at all.

**[01:34:17 - 01:34:21]** I remember it mowing down like three goblins outside the front door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:21 - 01:34:22]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:34:22 - 01:34:24]** I think it only killed one goblin.

**[01:34:24 - 01:34:26]** I think it was only one goblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:26 - 01:34:29]** I think I managed to position them a certain way.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:35]** You did try to invite Vare13 in, which they probably would have gone down in that attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:34:35 - 01:34:37]** I distinctly remember like, no, we were...

**[01:34:37 - 01:34:39]** fairy 13, you really should come with us.

**[01:34:39 - 01:34:44]** And Kev was like, no, she really should wait outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:34:44 - 01:34:45]** They should wait outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:34:45 - 01:34:47]** They should wait outside.

**[01:34:47 - 01:34:47]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:48 - 01:34:52]** I think I remember, I remember saying like, you know, it's dangerous in there and they probably shouldn't.

**[01:34:52 - 01:34:55]** So, yeah.

**[01:34:55 - 01:34:55]** Um,

**[01:34:55 - 01:34:59]** But that trap, I think I played pretty straight out of the book.

**[01:34:59 - 01:35:01]** It's hard to stop.

**[01:35:01 - 01:35:04]** It's hard to trick, and it will tear you down.

**[01:35:04 - 01:35:09]** My notes right now just says traps suck.

**[01:35:10 - 01:35:11]** Yeah.

**[01:35:11 - 01:35:12]** Starfighter traps are dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:35:13 - 01:35:16]** Because I think Chuck is the only one with computers, right?

**[01:35:18 - 01:35:19]** Or like the highest computers?

**[01:35:19 - 01:35:20]** Yeah, you have the highest computers.

**[01:35:21 - 01:35:27]** And so Chuck tried to take care of a couple of different things and eventually just shot the damn thing.

**[01:35:27 - 01:35:30]** It's like, I'm just going to shoot the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:35:30 - 01:35:39]** And this is one of the conversations I had with Jeremy and Adam in my Junkers GM group about like, what do I do for this trap?

**[01:35:39 - 01:35:40]** Because they're going to try this, this, and this.

**[01:35:41 - 01:35:44]** Like, I need to have every avenue covered and figure it out.

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:48]** And it's one of those things like, well, this is what the book says.

**[01:35:48 - 01:35:50]** This is what the rules say.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:52]** this is what you could do.

**[01:35:52 - 01:35:58]** And I think both of them so much for all their support, both emotionally and technically during this campaign.

**[01:35:59 - 01:36:01]** But yeah, you guys made it through the trap though.

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:02]** You actually handled it pretty well.

**[01:36:02 - 01:36:05]** It was, you realized it was going to run for, I think six rounds.

**[01:36:05 - 01:36:06]** So you just hid from it.

**[01:36:06 - 01:36:07]** Yeah.

**[01:36:07 - 01:36:07]** We ran out.

**[01:36:08 - 01:36:08]** Took it out.

**[01:36:09 - 01:36:10]** So you got through that trap.

**[01:36:11 - 01:36:12]** All the ghost sh**.

**[01:36:13 - 01:36:17]** In the book, the ghosts are in that room and you fight them.

**[01:36:17 - 01:36:19]** The dead drifts are back in that back room.

**[01:36:20 - 01:36:21]** Everything else I inserted.

**[01:36:22 - 01:36:26]** I inserted the scene within the room where you heard the tray drop.

**[01:36:27 - 01:36:30]** I inserted all the things walking through the hallways.

**[01:36:30 - 01:36:35]** And I love the way those scenes played out on that episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:36:35 - 01:36:47]** I very distinctly remember, like, such a sixth sense moment of, like, okay, I'm trying to explain to the rest of the crew, like, this is what I'm seeing, and no one believes me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:51]** That's exactly it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:36:51 - 01:36:53]** I didn't expect it to come out that way.

**[01:36:53 - 01:36:56]** I thought it was you guys would be like, oh, f*** that, there's ghosts here, like, be ready.

**[01:36:56 - 01:36:58]** But no, it was like...

**[01:36:58 - 01:36:59]** it tore you guys apart.

**[01:36:59 - 01:37:01]** It was, I don't believe it.

**[01:37:01 - 01:37:04]** And it was, it got into the conversation about like, what is, what does it mean to be a ghost?

**[01:37:05 - 01:37:13]** But yeah, in the book, it's in the book, it's just two, two drifted or in those two rooms or in that one room from a, from a metagaming perspective.


## Speaker_0

**[01:37:13 - 01:37:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:37:13 - 01:37:16]** One, I felt like the ghosts were indicating something.

**[01:37:17 - 01:37:24]** Okay, we need to go explore this space because that's the signpost for me to guide us in that particular direction.

**[01:37:24 - 01:37:29]** From a narrative perspective, Chak is on his first ever field mission.

**[01:37:30 - 01:37:31]** He's seeing f***ing ghosts.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:32]** Yeah.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:38]** So like the rest of the crew is like, yo, are you all right, dude?

**[01:37:40 - 01:37:46]** You need a vacation because what you're doing is not consistent with what the rest of us is doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:37:46 - 01:37:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:37:48 - 01:37:49]** It was awesome.

**[01:37:49 - 01:37:51]** I had a lot of fun prepping the Stellar Flare stuff.

**[01:37:52 - 01:38:00]** I think I was really upset with myself because I meant to... The security bot is supposed to be located somewhere and you guys run into it.

**[01:38:01 - 01:38:02]** I was like, well, I'm going to make it move.

**[01:38:02 - 01:38:08]** And so I was like, I'm going to put it in this corner and every round I'm going to move it three squares or whatever.

**[01:38:09 - 01:38:10]** And I forgot.

**[01:38:10 - 01:38:18]** I was so enthralled with that fight with the turret that by the time you guys saw the turret and figured it out,

**[01:38:18 - 01:38:20]** It was Will that was like, what's that thing in the corner?

**[01:38:21 - 01:38:22]** And I'm not even sure that made it into the edit.

**[01:38:23 - 01:38:25]** And I was like, no, fuck me.

**[01:38:26 - 01:38:32]** And that was just, again, it was, I just forgot.

**[01:38:32 - 01:38:35]** I had it on my Excel sheet and everything to do that.

**[01:38:35 - 01:38:36]** And it just didn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:38:36 - 01:38:37]** You were doing a great job.

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:38]** Don't worry.

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:40]** The artwork disappeared.

**[01:38:40 - 01:38:41]** I can't delete it.

**[01:38:41 - 01:38:41]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:38:43 - 01:38:52]** Explicitly, you forgot, but also like just the sound, just the description of that ticking sound, the tap, tap, tap.

**[01:38:53 - 01:38:53]** Exactly.

**[01:38:53 - 01:39:03]** Like the ominous nature of the inside of the Stellar Flare or the part that we're in right now or the part that we were in to finish the adventure.


## Speaker_0

**[01:39:03 - 01:39:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:39:04 - 01:39:11]** Yeah, and again, I added a ton of stuff to this, but I didn't vary too much from what was already provided.

**[01:39:12 - 01:39:14]** I just developed it more.

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:19]** That's my advice to new GMs, is don't be afraid to embellish that.

**[01:39:19 - 01:39:20]** Just make it your own.

**[01:39:21 - 01:39:23]** You made an atmosphere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:39:23 - 01:39:33]** And it's when the atmosphere influences player decisions that I think you start to get to the real fun part of the game.

**[01:39:34 - 01:39:44]** Benny said it, and I just realized it earlier, when you made the conflict between the Keshis and the goblins and us and all that feel so real.

**[01:39:44 - 01:39:54]** I, John, as Rolu, kicked over Bomb Gozzle because I was like mad at Bomb Gozzle because I thought Bomb Gozzle was going to be on our side.

**[01:39:54 - 01:39:57]** And then Bomb Gozzle got like attack chalk.

**[01:39:57 - 01:39:58]** And I'm like, what the hell?

**[01:39:59 - 01:40:00]** Don't you see what the real problem is here?

**[01:40:01 - 01:40:02]** Like we are helping you out.

**[01:40:02 - 01:40:03]** And I got upset.

**[01:40:03 - 01:40:08]** And then in the stellar flare, this ambiance made us question shock.

**[01:40:08 - 01:40:11]** It made us like question what was going on.

**[01:40:11 - 01:40:13]** Like what is the actual purpose here?

**[01:40:13 - 01:40:14]** What did we get ourselves into?

**[01:40:14 - 01:40:24]** And it's all because you added in these extra things that changed the ambiance and the environment and how we felt just looking at a map on a screen.

**[01:40:24 - 01:40:25]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:25 - 01:40:29]** And that's something I played a lot with was like, where do I drop these things so you run into them next?

**[01:40:30 - 01:40:31]** And how do I describe them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:40:31 - 01:40:31]** That's great.

**[01:40:32 - 01:40:36]** I felt like this was a significant shift from...

**[01:40:37 - 01:40:41]** Happy-go-lucky pirate adventure in the desert to thriller.

**[01:40:42 - 01:40:46]** Psychological, like, you don't know what's behind this door.

**[01:40:47 - 01:40:55]** If it's going to be an empty room, if it's going to be a wall of sand, if it's going to be zombie drifted trying to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:55 - 01:40:58]** If it's going to be an electric floor that shocks and kills you.

**[01:40:59 - 01:41:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:01 - 01:41:01]** Yes.

**[01:41:01 - 01:41:03]** That was by the book.


## Speaker_0

**[01:41:03 - 01:41:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:03 - 01:41:04]** Funhouse of terror.

**[01:41:04 - 01:41:05]** The electric shock was by the book.

**[01:41:06 - 01:41:11]** Honestly, like I didn't, and that's the thing is I didn't, I didn't change the mechanics of the stellar flare at all.

**[01:41:11 - 01:41:13]** I just, like you said, I changed the ambience.

**[01:41:14 - 01:41:14]** The atmosphere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:41:15 - 01:41:17]** You made it far more sinister, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:41:17 - 01:41:19]** Which was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:20 - 01:41:21]** I'm sad you guys didn't use it.

**[01:41:21 - 01:41:24]** I think Rolly was the only one to actually use anything.

**[01:41:24 - 01:41:31]** I did add all of that stuff into the storage unit with the spell gems and the scrolls.

**[01:41:32 - 01:41:35]** I was going to use the acidic mist on Testrona.

**[01:41:35 - 01:41:36]** I know, I know.

**[01:41:36 - 01:41:38]** Yeah, and then you nerf that.

**[01:41:38 - 01:41:39]** We'll talk this in a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:41:40 - 01:41:46]** From a universal perspective, pre-gap relics have to have a ridiculous amount of value.

**[01:41:47 - 01:41:59]** So dropping pre-gap scrolls into the Stellar Flare not only aged the Stellar Flare appropriately, but also were like, okay, these are the stakes that you are playing on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:59 - 01:42:08]** And I don't think – I think the only thing that's actually in that room in the book is the zero – well, it's not even – Yeah.

**[01:42:09 - 01:42:10]** Sorry.

**[01:42:10 - 01:42:11]** I had to burp.

**[01:42:11 - 01:42:13]** The –

**[01:42:13 - 01:42:16]** The Zero Frost Blaster, it's not that in the book.

**[01:42:16 - 01:42:17]** I forget what it is.

**[01:42:17 - 01:42:18]** Frostbite Class Zero Pistol.

**[01:42:19 - 01:42:19]** Right.

**[01:42:19 - 01:42:25]** In the book, it's a melee weapon that has a ghost killer fusion.

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:27]** Yeah, that would have been useful.

**[01:42:27 - 01:42:29]** That's really useful.

**[01:42:29 - 01:42:30]** Yeah, wow.

**[01:42:30 - 01:42:34]** But the problem is you guys, none of you are melee fighters.

**[01:42:34 - 01:42:40]** Even after I gave the Dashko to Kelly, by the way, everything that Zethelred dropped was not in the book.

**[01:42:41 - 01:42:48]** I added all of that for you guys to play with, including Kelly asked me for a flaming sword from the very beginning of this book.

**[01:42:48 - 01:42:50]** And I was like, I'll try to work that in.

**[01:42:50 - 01:42:54]** So I gave him a flaming ember dashco, which is actually out of Junkers Delight.

**[01:42:54 - 01:42:58]** It was made for this book, but it was the flaming dashco is Dotrulu's weapon.

**[01:42:59 - 01:43:00]** That's the only reason it's in this book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:00 - 01:43:05]** When I was talking to Kevin, I was like, actually, initially I wanted a lightsaber is what I wanted.

**[01:43:05 - 01:43:11]** So basically when Tess Tronin showed up, I was like, yes, perfect.

**[01:43:11 - 01:43:12]** This is where I'm getting it from.

**[01:43:12 - 01:43:13]** Kevin's dropping it for me.

**[01:43:14 - 01:43:16]** The Salarian.

**[01:43:16 - 01:43:18]** And I was like, when we're done with it, I'm going to pick off the sword.

**[01:43:18 - 01:43:19]** Salarians can't drop their weapons.

**[01:43:19 - 01:43:20]** It says that in the book.

**[01:43:21 - 01:43:21]** Whatever.

**[01:43:21 - 01:43:22]** I didn't know that.

**[01:43:22 - 01:43:25]** But then anyway, things turned out as they did.

**[01:43:25 - 01:43:29]** Those scrolls are really from like Pathfinder era, like pre-Gap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:43:29 - 01:43:31]** I forget exactly how I worked them out.

**[01:43:31 - 01:43:35]** I think I actually pulled... All the spells I pulled, I think I pulled from Starfinder.

**[01:43:35 - 01:43:38]** So I found Starfinder spells that would work.

**[01:43:39 - 01:43:41]** And I just added... I put them on scrolls.

**[01:43:41 - 01:43:46]** But I mean, again... And this is just talking about... I love Paizo for this.

**[01:43:46 - 01:43:50]** A lot of stuff that comes from Pathfinder is directly linked.

**[01:43:50 - 01:43:52]** Or Starfinder is directly linked to Pathfinder.

**[01:43:53 - 01:43:54]** So the spells aren't that different.

**[01:43:54 - 01:43:56]** They all correlate.

**[01:43:56 - 01:43:56]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:56 - 01:44:04]** You know, as a random side point, but the connection between Pathfinder and Starfinder, it'd be kind of cool to see like elves and dwarves because they still exist in this universe.

**[01:44:04 - 01:44:05]** They're seldom played.

**[01:44:05 - 01:44:05]** Elves do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:05 - 01:44:06]** They're on Castor Ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:07 - 01:44:07]** Yeah.

**[01:44:07 - 01:44:07]** Yeah.

**[01:44:07 - 01:44:10]** But it'd be kind of cool to see them around again.

**[01:44:10 - 01:44:10]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:44:10 - 01:44:10]** Yeah.

**[01:44:10 - 01:44:12]** Elves canonically come from Castor Ball.

**[01:44:12 - 01:44:12]** Anyway.

**[01:44:12 - 01:44:13]** That's data storage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:13 - 01:44:15]** Supply closet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:44:16 - 01:44:18]** Were you looking else to see what we did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:18 - 01:44:18]** Yeah.

**[01:44:19 - 01:44:24]** I'm actually... So supply closet is actually only two paragraphs long and it says...

**[01:44:25 - 01:44:34]** During a short leave on apostate, a clever drow merchant duped a member of the ship's crew into spending their credits on an unwieldy magic weapon.

**[01:44:35 - 01:44:39]** Later, the embarrassed crew member hid their purchase.

**[01:44:39 - 01:44:47]** A character who succeeds a DC 21 perception check finds a loose panel with the ghost killer tactical swoop hammer.

**[01:44:48 - 01:44:54]** But this is, and this is, again, this is Junkers Delight being amazing, is there is this, I'll show you guys the screen.

**[01:44:54 - 01:44:55]** There are these blue blocks.

**[01:44:55 - 01:44:56]** That blue block is a GM note.

**[01:44:57 - 01:45:02]** And the GM note says, if your players are melee characters, you might want to give them an alternative.

**[01:45:02 - 01:45:06]** And the alternative is the zero, where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:45:06 - 01:45:08]** Zero class frostbite pistol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:45:08 - 01:45:09]** Yes.

**[01:45:09 - 01:45:11]** A frostbite class zero pistol.

**[01:45:11 - 01:45:13]** It says you might want to actually switch it.

**[01:45:13 - 01:45:14]** So I did.

**[01:45:15 - 01:45:24]** Um, and that's cause you get at least half damage from that as opposed to, but also I thought, I also thought too, that the ghost killer fusion was very telling and I didn't want that to be a spoiler.

**[01:45:24 - 01:45:25]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:45:26 - 01:45:26]** Fair enough.

**[01:45:26 - 01:45:33]** So the, um, something, and I want to take a half step back before we get into the, um, Southern flair.

**[01:45:34 - 01:45:43]** When we were doing our overnight watches, one of the, the, the myths, I guess the goblin shared with Chuck was that the ship groans every few years.

**[01:45:43 - 01:45:47]** Like somebody tries to leave with the ship every so often.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:45:47 - 01:45:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:45:49 - 01:45:50]** Tell me more about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:45:50 - 01:45:53]** I made all that shit up.

**[01:45:53 - 01:45:53]** Awesome.

**[01:45:53 - 01:46:04]** So my idea was like each of them – I think in the book there is a section where they tell you – I think it's Kesh and Merc are the ones that tell you rumors about the Stellar Flare.

**[01:46:05 - 01:46:06]** And they give you some ideas.

**[01:46:06 - 01:46:07]** I think about the ghosts in there.

**[01:46:07 - 01:46:10]** It's just like sentences, single sentence.

**[01:46:10 - 01:46:11]** Hey, there's ghosts.

**[01:46:11 - 01:46:13]** There's blah, blah.

**[01:46:14 - 01:46:16]** But the one with the groaning, I think I made that one up.

**[01:46:16 - 01:46:18]** The idea was that they –

**[01:46:18 - 01:46:44]** at least the idea that i put into it was these these drift uh dead that are in here occasionally try to start the ship they they all come back to life or enough that they are able to start up the ship and get it moving and then it doesn't go anywhere but in in reality what i wanted to what was actually happening is the gray and we'll talk about the gray in a little bit

**[01:46:44 - 01:46:45]** but the gray is doing shit.

**[01:46:45 - 01:46:48]** And that is what the Keshti's and the goblins are hearing.

**[01:46:48 - 01:46:51]** Another thing I was playing with too, is that the goblins have a very short lifespan.

**[01:46:51 - 01:46:53]** I think their lifespan is only 40, 40 or 60 years.

**[01:46:53 - 01:46:59]** So the idea that they, they have accelerated, um, like aging.

**[01:47:00 - 01:47:00]** Yeah.

**[01:47:00 - 01:47:04]** So a younger Keshti versus an older Keshti is much shorter than what you're used to.

**[01:47:04 - 01:47:07]** So 10 years is a long time to a goblin.

**[01:47:07 - 01:47:08]** It's kind of what I wanted to play.

**[01:47:08 - 01:47:09]** That's fair.

**[01:47:09 - 01:47:10]** That's fair.


## Speaker_0

**[01:47:11 - 01:47:11]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:11 - 01:47:15]** Will, fantastic use of all your equipment.

**[01:47:16 - 01:47:16]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:47:16 - 01:47:17]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:18 - 01:47:18]** What did I do?

**[01:47:18 - 01:47:19]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:47:20 - 01:47:21]** Both before and after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:22 - 01:47:26]** The flash grenade with the proximity mine, all of that stuff.

**[01:47:26 - 01:47:26]** Genius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:47:27 - 01:47:27]** I try.

**[01:47:27 - 01:47:38]** Well, and I feel like Will is becoming famous for like, okay, I'm going to create all of this synergy between my features and my abilities and my equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:47:38 - 01:47:38]** Yep.

**[01:47:38 - 01:47:41]** And this goes back to our D&D game, which you weren't a part of, Vinny.

**[01:47:42 - 01:47:43]** Ball bearings.

**[01:47:43 - 01:47:57]** Will's rogue always carried ball-bearing balls, just to clarify, ball-bearing balls, and would throw them at the most opportune times, which led to, I think, a multi-kill of wolves on a very small bridge.

**[01:47:57 - 01:47:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:47:59 - 01:48:00]** Many wolves drop to their death.

**[01:48:01 - 01:48:09]** Where after Kevin posted a picture of a bunch of dead wolves in our notes.

**[01:48:09 - 01:48:11]** It's a way to mock all of us, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:48:11 - 01:48:14]** Yep, it's funny.

**[01:48:15 - 01:48:24]** I'd like to try and think about what my character would purchase and take with him on a journey such as this.

**[01:48:24 - 01:48:30]** And I was going to mention it too when we were doing the Zethelred camp.

**[01:48:30 - 01:48:32]** I was like marking.

**[01:48:32 - 01:48:41]** Like I try to, I look at these like puzzles as puzzles and my characters like trying to navigate.

**[01:48:41 - 01:48:45]** So you would like leave breadcrumbs, be like, okay, let's step here guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:48:45 - 01:48:45]** Come on.

**[01:48:45 - 01:48:49]** And I think I just skipped over that, but yeah, that's not the red map is that's like, that's it straight out of the book.

**[01:48:50 - 01:48:52]** Is there locations where there are mines?

**[01:48:52 - 01:48:54]** And if you get hit by the mine, you explode.

**[01:48:55 - 01:49:00]** And I think it was, it was Will that was like, wait, we need to, we need to figure out where these mines are.

**[01:49:00 - 01:49:01]** And play Minesweeper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:49:01 - 01:49:03]** In case we have to run through this again.


## Speaker_0

**[01:49:04 - 01:49:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:49:04 - 01:49:06]** And it worked out so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:49:06 - 01:49:10]** It was so... It was hilarious to me as an audience member.

**[01:49:11 - 01:49:14]** Because, like, Terminator's like, yes, this is Minesweeper.

**[01:49:14 - 01:49:16]** We need to take a systematic approach.

**[01:49:16 - 01:49:19]** And Jack is like, I'm just going to run through what's going on here.


## Speaker_0

**[01:49:21 - 01:49:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:49:21 - 01:49:23]** Yeah, it was fun.

**[01:49:24 - 01:49:26]** That was one of those episodes I was like, I don't know how this is going to play out.

**[01:49:27 - 01:49:27]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:49:28 - 01:49:29]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:49:31 - 01:49:33]** So you guys made it through Stellar Flare.

**[01:49:33 - 01:49:35]** I think Stellar Flare took about four or five episodes to get through.

**[01:49:35 - 01:49:37]** I had a lot of fun with that.

**[01:49:37 - 01:49:38]** I think you guys played through it really well.

**[01:49:38 - 01:49:40]** You were very skeptical and moving around.

**[01:49:40 - 01:49:44]** That's when I introduced The Grey for the first time officially for...

**[01:49:44 - 01:49:51]** was you guys came across that center corridor, and I had the wall of blackness, and I had the leg going through the wall.

**[01:49:51 - 01:49:53]** Again, you guys didn't know it was a gray.

**[01:49:53 - 01:49:54]** You still didn't know it was a gray.

**[01:49:55 - 01:49:58]** And then you guys ended up fighting the two drifteds.

**[01:49:59 - 01:50:01]** I connected it all to the ghosts.

**[01:50:01 - 01:50:02]** I gave them personalities.

**[01:50:02 - 01:50:05]** The two drifteds that were in there were the same drifted, and they were just drifted.

**[01:50:06 - 01:50:09]** But I was like, well, the book does mention Dr. Swinney.

**[01:50:10 - 01:50:13]** And I was like, why isn't Dr. Swinney mentioned anywhere else in this book?

**[01:50:13 - 01:50:15]** And so I made Dr. Swinney one of the two drift ads.

**[01:50:16 - 01:50:21]** And that's where I added in the tags, the ID tags.

**[01:50:21 - 01:50:24]** The ID tags are mentioned in the book, but not specifically.

**[01:50:25 - 01:50:26]** I think it says like, oh, they can find them.

**[01:50:27 - 01:50:29]** But I was like, no, they find them on the body.

**[01:50:29 - 01:50:31]** It makes sense that those are like badges that they're wearing.

**[01:50:33 - 01:50:36]** Which those didn't really come into play at any point, more than I thought they would.

**[01:50:37 - 01:50:38]** But it was still fun.

**[01:50:38 - 01:50:38]** Well, for the turret.


## Speaker_0

**[01:50:38 - 01:50:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:50:39 - 01:50:40]** But it never actually came.

**[01:50:40 - 01:50:43]** It was actively used, right?

**[01:50:43 - 01:50:47]** It's not like you guys were like, the turret's on and I'm standing here and it's not hitting me.

**[01:50:47 - 01:50:48]** I don't think that actually happened, did it?

**[01:50:49 - 01:50:49]** It might have.

**[01:50:50 - 01:50:51]** I don't think it did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:50:51 - 01:50:55]** I think by the time it mattered, it would have smashed it to pieces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:50:56 - 01:50:57]** Right.

**[01:50:57 - 01:51:01]** But it was still a great part of the world to add in, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:51:02 - 01:51:05]** There was a couple times that I was like, oh man, Rolo's not wearing it.

**[01:51:05 - 01:51:06]** He's about to die.

**[01:51:07 - 01:51:12]** If you guys would have said, I'm starting it up now, and then, yeah, I would have killed brother.

**[01:51:12 - 01:51:20]** Anyways, then I added the TV in there and the lighting, but the electricity trap was in there and in the book as is.

**[01:51:21 - 01:51:21]** I didn't change much of that.

**[01:51:22 - 01:51:23]** And then the lab.

**[01:51:24 - 01:51:26]** I changed everything in the lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:51:26 - 01:51:28]** The lab is where the ghosts were?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:51:29 - 01:51:30]** No, that's where the grave was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:51:31 - 01:51:34]** The study room is where the ghosts were.

**[01:51:34 - 01:51:41]** I did add in the artifact thing that you guys found and I was shocked that you guys were so fixated on the artifact because again, that's a MacGuffin.

**[01:51:42 - 01:51:44]** There was like the thing on the floor that was a MacGuffin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:51:44 - 01:51:45]** A red herring basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:51:45 - 01:51:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:51:47 - 01:51:48]** Well, yeah, it was a red herring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:51:48 - 01:52:01]** Um, so like what I really love as a picture of a MacGuffin is the beginning, if anyone's ever seen it of Lego Batman, where the plane flying with all of the Batman villains is called a MacGuffin air.

**[01:52:01 - 01:52:12]** A MacGuffin is basically a plot device where it is the incentive for the protagonist to go do what they are going to do in the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:13 - 01:52:16]** But not the actual reason.

**[01:52:16 - 01:52:19]** No, the puck is the real objective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:52:20 - 01:52:21]** It might be the real reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:21 - 01:52:23]** It might be the stated reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:52:23 - 01:52:24]** Oh, okay.

**[01:52:25 - 01:52:25]** This is new.

**[01:52:25 - 01:52:28]** I thought the MacGuffin is just an object that is the reason.

**[01:52:29 - 01:52:30]** It doesn't matter whether it's real.

**[01:52:30 - 01:52:31]** A fake one is a red herring.

**[01:52:31 - 01:52:37]** A MacGuffin is like, I got to go get the one ring because that's a MacGuffin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:40 - 01:52:44]** We talked about Jason Keeley and there was a definition.

**[01:52:45 - 01:52:47]** I'm so sorry about your guys' podcast title.

**[01:52:47 - 01:52:49]** I'm just running a blank.

**[01:52:49 - 01:52:50]** There's a podcast called

**[01:52:50 - 01:52:55]** They actually interviewed Jason Keeley about this episode, and we'll drop the link for it.

**[01:52:56 - 01:52:59]** And he mentions that the MacGuffin is the drift drive.

**[01:52:59 - 01:53:01]** The entire time, the MacGuffin is the drift drive.

**[01:53:02 - 01:53:02]** It is an object.

**[01:53:02 - 01:53:11]** This is by definition, according to dictionary.com, an object or device in a movie or book that serves merely as a trigger for a plot point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:53:12 - 01:53:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:12 - 01:53:18]** So I was using the little statue of Triune to get you guys into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:53:19 - 01:53:20]** So that is a MacGuffin.

**[01:53:20 - 01:53:20]** Okay.

**[01:53:20 - 01:53:22]** So the puck is not a MacGuffin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:22 - 01:53:28]** So I guess a red herring would be that plus the fact that it is a false narrative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:53:28 - 01:53:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:53:29 - 01:53:32]** So I think the statue of Triune was a red herring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:53:32 - 01:53:33]** Yes.

**[01:53:33 - 01:53:34]** It was also a MacGuffin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:53:34 - 01:53:43]** Because what happened was, Chak, at least I as the player, thought the statue was the trigger for whatever we were afraid of.

**[01:53:43 - 01:53:46]** Or, like, whatever Wilson was aiming for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:46 - 01:53:48]** Yeah, Torme was all over it, too.

**[01:53:48 - 01:53:51]** He was like, if I destroy it, will that save me?

**[01:53:51 - 01:53:53]** And I was like, you can roll mysticism, I guess.

**[01:53:54 - 01:53:55]** I made this up, man.

**[01:53:55 - 01:53:55]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:53:57 - 01:53:59]** The games are made up and the points don't matter, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:53:59 - 01:54:00]** Right.

**[01:54:00 - 01:54:24]** and the way you guys handled those were i i loved those up i i loved playing that game with you fighting the incorporeals and the and like the whole action scene at the end where you were all like back to back to back to back do do do do uh john gloria like so so there was a lot there were a few moments where check was like because this is his first field experience


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:54:24 - 01:54:31]** Hitting the kill shot on Tinkerton was one of the most surreal, like, okay, I can actually do this.

**[01:54:31 - 01:54:34]** I'm actually, I'm a real field agent right now.

**[01:54:35 - 01:54:39]** Getting knocked down multiple times.

**[01:54:40 - 01:54:47]** By the Drift Dead was one of those, like, come to Jesus moments where Chuck was like, okay, maybe I'm not actually cut out for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:47 - 01:54:49]** Because you also took out Bomb Guzzle, right?

**[01:54:49 - 01:54:49]** Yeah.

**[01:54:50 - 01:54:50]** Or Sashla.

**[01:54:50 - 01:54:51]** One of the two.

**[01:54:51 - 01:54:51]** Bomb Guzzle.

**[01:54:51 - 01:54:53]** You got the final shot on them.

**[01:54:53 - 01:54:53]** Yeah.

**[01:54:53 - 01:54:54]** So, yeah, you're right.

**[01:54:54 - 01:54:56]** You were, like, inflated ego at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:54:56 - 01:54:57]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:57 - 01:55:00]** And then you rolled... I love the... I love...

**[01:55:00 - 01:55:03]** The wisdom saves and how you always fail them.

**[01:55:04 - 01:55:04]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:55:05 - 01:55:07]** So this is what happens as a player.

**[01:55:08 - 01:55:10]** Because the conflict is existential.

**[01:55:10 - 01:55:10]** Love it.

**[01:55:11 - 01:55:12]** I want to do a thing.

**[01:55:12 - 01:55:14]** I think this is a good choice.

**[01:55:15 - 01:55:19]** But we are all on this podcast playing other individuals.

**[01:55:19 - 01:55:22]** So how do we make these individuals feel lived in?

**[01:55:23 - 01:55:29]** How do we make decisions on behalf of other people that we hope would be authentic to them?


## Speaker_0

**[01:55:30 - 01:55:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:55:30 - 01:55:59]** I just sort of took the easy way out and said we'll let the dice decide and I think it fit perfectly for Chalk because like Chalk is kind of what's the word for it unpredictable foolhardy yeah and so it's like leaving that up to the dice was the right answer I think and it made for some amazing scenes as a leaf in the wind just going around floating by and like however way the wind blows that's the Rex Lightlife


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:55:59 - 01:56:07]** So we've talked recently about writing bios for our website for the Junkers Delight characters, not just for our threefold characters.

**[01:56:08 - 01:56:15]** And I describe Chalk as everyone's drunk uncle who makes most of their decision by rolls of the dice.

**[01:56:15 - 01:56:16]** I like it.

**[01:56:16 - 01:56:17]** I think that's Chalk.

**[01:56:17 - 01:56:19]** That's the Raxalite lifestyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:56:20 - 01:56:22]** I didn't choose the Raxalite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:56:23 - 01:56:23]** It chose me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:56:24 - 01:56:25]** The Raxalite chose me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:56:27 - 01:56:32]** So that led you guys into the lab, finally.

**[01:56:32 - 01:56:35]** The lab is the final stage.

**[01:56:37 - 01:56:40]** Even with the Dotrulu fight, and I'll get to that in a little bit.

**[01:56:41 - 01:56:42]** So you guys got into the lab.

**[01:56:43 - 01:56:45]** You got through that clean room.

**[01:56:46 - 01:56:49]** So here's where things took a left turn.

**[01:56:50 - 01:56:54]** The book says there's a drift phantom and you find the information.

**[01:56:55 - 01:56:56]** I added the gray.

**[01:56:57 - 01:56:59]** I added the gray for the whole story purpose.

**[01:56:59 - 01:57:02]** I added the gray to connect us back to threefold.

**[01:57:02 - 01:57:06]** And I told John, John didn't know about the gray until too late.

**[01:57:06 - 01:57:09]** And I was like, hey, John, I got this idea for this gray.

**[01:57:09 - 01:57:10]** I told him like really early on.

**[01:57:12 - 01:57:12]** That's fine.

**[01:57:12 - 01:57:14]** I finally pointed out where it was going to be.

**[01:57:14 - 01:57:16]** I think John was like, don't put the gray in.

**[01:57:16 - 01:57:17]** Just don't do it.

**[01:57:18 - 01:57:21]** And I was like, well, too late.

**[01:57:21 - 01:57:22]** I'm already doing it, man.

**[01:57:23 - 01:57:27]** I didn't say that to him, but that's kind of how it ended up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:57:27 - 01:57:28]** Kev said, you're not my real dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:57:30 - 01:57:32]** But yeah, the...

**[01:57:32 - 01:57:38]** I think putting the gray in there, I added the gray in a little bit, but I didn't want to make them too strong.

**[01:57:38 - 01:57:40]** I didn't want to make them take over the scene.

**[01:57:41 - 01:57:46]** But the idea is that the gray has been here for 300 years, since the wreck 300 years ago.

**[01:57:47 - 01:57:50]** And it's been closed inside of this lab for that long.

**[01:57:51 - 01:57:54]** And it's been trying to get a hold of that stone.

**[01:57:54 - 01:57:54]** Different.

**[01:57:54 - 01:57:59]** And it was only in the last 10 years that it was able to create Tinkerton to go outside and get in.

**[01:57:59 - 01:57:59]** What?

**[01:57:59 - 01:58:08]** But it is an old gray that's been isolated for that long, which is another reason I made the Aklo language be... Okay, I'm calling a timeout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:58:10 - 01:58:10]** Here's why.

**[01:58:10 - 01:58:16]** What Kev just said, and I don't want this to be lost on anyone...

**[01:58:17 - 01:58:20]** within the last 10 years created Tinkerton to come out.

**[01:58:20 - 01:58:35]** So Kev just tied together the short lifespan of goblins, the short lifespan of a Keshti, the existence of the gray in the lab and everything that's happening on the stellar flare to one single sentence.

**[01:58:36 - 01:58:45]** The gray created Tinkerton to go out and find this rock, which as a whole lot of,

**[01:58:45 - 01:58:48]** of inspiration for what we as a crew did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:58:48 - 01:58:51]** I mean, that was my gimmicks for it.

**[01:58:51 - 01:58:55]** I wouldn't say that the stuff, like I think the Drifted existed long before this.

**[01:58:55 - 01:58:58]** I think Drifted probably existed since the crash.

**[01:58:59 - 01:59:02]** And what I'm getting at is like the Grey has been experimenting this whole time.

**[01:59:02 - 01:59:09]** It wasn't until the last 10 years that they were like, well, I can conjure this Drift golem to go get it.

**[01:59:09 - 01:59:13]** And then the drift phantom was kind of a separate thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:59:14 - 01:59:16]** Why didn't the gray go himself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:59:17 - 01:59:19]** Because grays aren't supposed to be seen.

**[01:59:19 - 01:59:20]** It's part of their culture.

**[01:59:21 - 01:59:22]** Okay.

**[01:59:22 - 01:59:23]** At least that's the way I viewed it.

**[01:59:24 - 01:59:25]** It was like they're secretive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:59:25 - 01:59:26]** I would agree.

**[01:59:26 - 01:59:29]** It's a cultural aspect that they have to exist in the shadows.

**[01:59:30 - 01:59:32]** Another thing is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:59:32 - 01:59:41]** Another thing I'm toying with that I don't know if John is, it's up to John, but like a thing that I toyed with is the idea that this was a young Grey along for the adventure that got almost abandoned.

**[01:59:42 - 01:59:46]** And so they don't, it's not like they were, they weren't like a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:59:46 - 01:59:48]** They couldn't go out on their own necessarily.

**[01:59:48 - 01:59:52]** It's like a child or an infant trying to reach out into the void.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:59:53 - 01:59:59]** Right, and which then adds to the idea of them trying to get home, at least with all the information I gave you on the computer.

**[02:00:00 - 02:00:01]** So there was that aspect of it.

**[02:00:01 - 02:00:02]** What was the other thing I was going to say?

**[02:00:02 - 02:00:03]** Oh, yeah, the Drift Phantom.

**[02:00:04 - 02:00:05]** So in the book, the Drift Phantom just exists.

**[02:00:06 - 02:00:10]** It does take on your ability or your perspective, the different characters.

**[02:00:10 - 02:00:13]** It does change shape, which I just love.

**[02:00:13 - 02:00:14]** I love the idea of that.

**[02:00:14 - 02:00:15]** It's cool.

**[02:00:15 - 02:00:15]** It's a cool character.

**[02:00:15 - 02:00:16]** Yep.

**[02:00:15 - 02:00:18]** But I kind of just embellished on that a little bit.

**[02:00:19 - 02:00:22]** And originally I had the phantom kill the gray.

**[02:00:23 - 02:00:34]** I was going to make you guys fight the gray for a little bit, and then she does something, opens this portal, the phantom comes out, swipes the gray dead, and then you guys have to fight the phantom.

**[02:00:35 - 02:00:38]** But I didn't like the way that turned out in the end, so I changed it on the fly.

**[02:00:39 - 02:00:39]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:00:39 - 02:00:41]** I think it was a good move.

**[02:00:41 - 02:00:45]** It's always better, I think, for these kind of fights to up the challenge, right?

**[02:00:45 - 02:00:48]** To have both the gray and the drift phantom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:00:49 - 02:00:52]** And that drift phantom fight sucked.

**[02:00:52 - 02:00:56]** But that's because I forgot how DR works, and I didn't even mention it to you guys, and that's my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:00:56 - 02:01:00]** But then Torme did that sweet cyclone, which was cool.

**[02:01:01 - 02:01:02]** It was a critical fail.

**[02:01:02 - 02:01:04]** It was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:01:05 - 02:01:07]** That somehow worked in our favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:01:08 - 02:01:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[02:01:09 - 02:01:11]** And then you had that bit where you were confused.

**[02:01:11 - 02:01:13]** Yeah, it was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:01:13 - 02:01:34]** I was just going to take a half step back to talk about how the Phantom would have... The Phantom offing the Grey would have either subverted the Greys as the big bad of threefold, like would have cheapened them as villains or would have created the Phantom as like this superhuman...

**[02:01:35 - 02:01:38]** outrageously powerful bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:01:40 - 02:01:45]** In the book, it says the Phantom exists because the goblins actually get into it.

**[02:01:46 - 02:01:50]** In the book, the goblins are just junk seekers.

**[02:01:50 - 02:01:53]** The idea is that they are looking for technology.

**[02:01:54 - 02:02:00]** In the book, they get into Stellar Flare and when they get in there, they trigger the security systems by starting up that drift drive.

**[02:02:00 - 02:02:03]** That's what creates the Phantom and turns on the turret and blah, blah, blah.

**[02:02:04 - 02:02:12]** So I just kind of took that out of it and said that the stellar flare was sealed this entire time because the gray had that control.

**[02:02:14 - 02:02:16]** Yeah.

**[02:02:16 - 02:02:16]** Makes sense.

**[02:02:17 - 02:02:17]** Yeah.

**[02:02:17 - 02:02:20]** One other thing about that fight was you guys ran away?

**[02:02:20 - 02:02:22]** All of you.

**[02:02:22 - 02:02:23]** You pulled a full Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:02:25 - 02:02:27]** Tactical retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:02:27 - 02:02:29]** And I was like, motherfuckers.

**[02:02:31 - 02:02:32]** Well, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:02:32 - 02:02:34]** We didn't all run away.

**[02:02:34 - 02:02:36]** It made perfect sense story-wise.

**[02:02:36 - 02:02:47]** And I think tactically speaking, we identified a couple of better opportunities to engage with this gray that would have included like, okay, maybe we can flank it in the halls.

**[02:02:47 - 02:02:54]** Maybe we can draw it out into like murder holes instead of finding it on its own terms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:02:54 - 02:02:57]** Plus, it's like it's not our job to fight the gray.

**[02:02:57 - 02:03:04]** And like from Thaddeus's perspective, the only reason we're fighting him is because Rolly refuses to give up this fucking puck.

**[02:03:04 - 02:03:04]** Right.

**[02:03:05 - 02:03:05]** Yep.

**[02:03:05 - 02:03:08]** So then like it's like we have a mission to do.

**[02:03:08 - 02:03:09]** We have everything we need.

**[02:03:10 - 02:03:14]** It is it is endangering the mission as well as our own lives to be fighting this gray.

**[02:03:14 - 02:03:15]** There's no reason to do it.

**[02:03:15 - 02:03:17]** So he's just like, just give him the puck.

**[02:03:17 - 02:03:18]** He wouldn't do it.

**[02:03:18 - 02:03:20]** So then we're like, let's just get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:03:20 - 02:03:22]** It was a great scene.

**[02:03:22 - 02:03:23]** I mean, that all fits, right?

**[02:03:23 - 02:03:25]** That motivation tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:03:25 - 02:03:32]** Well, and I think that was the beginning of the narrative of this is not just a f*** Roloose story.

**[02:03:32 - 02:03:33]** No.

**[02:03:33 - 02:03:39]** This puck is not his ransom for something purely selfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:03:39 - 02:03:40]** Right.

**[02:03:40 - 02:03:44]** Well, yeah, we don't know that until later, according to Rolu at least, right?

**[02:03:44 - 02:03:46]** So, yeah.

**[02:03:46 - 02:03:48]** We still don't know that as players right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:03:49 - 02:03:56]** And this was one of the hardest things I had for this whole game was, what does the puck actually do?

**[02:03:56 - 02:03:58]** And John, he can't tell me.

**[02:03:58 - 02:03:59]** He won't tell me.

**[02:03:59 - 02:04:01]** Because it still has implications in our main game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:04:02 - 02:04:04]** Yeah, that can't be said, right?

**[02:04:04 - 02:04:16]** And this is the wild part of we'll save in the interstellar tales from the intergalactic adventure anthology.

**[02:04:16 - 02:04:17]** Thank you.

**[02:04:18 - 02:04:22]** Like there are questions from this adventure that still remain unanswered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:04:22 - 02:04:23]** Yeah.

**[02:04:23 - 02:04:23]** Yeah.

**[02:04:24 - 02:04:26]** And this was a good turning point.

**[02:04:26 - 02:04:28]** So you guys killed the Grey.

**[02:04:29 - 02:04:33]** Tremé tried to rise it from the dead with grave words again.

**[02:04:33 - 02:04:35]** F*** you and your grave words.

**[02:04:36 - 02:04:37]** I hate it.

**[02:04:37 - 02:04:38]** Oh, it's so f***ing classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:04:39 - 02:04:41]** He doesn't want to talk to the dead.

**[02:04:41 - 02:04:41]** Just a second.

**[02:04:41 - 02:04:43]** Thank you to Jason Keighley and his New York accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:04:47 - 02:04:51]** And then you guys killed the Drift Phantom after we retconned that entire fight.

**[02:04:51 - 02:04:56]** That's when we got to that situation with Rolu.

**[02:04:57 - 02:05:02]** Rolu had the stone in his pocket and he was actually paralyzed by the Drift Phantom.

**[02:05:03 - 02:05:11]** And just full transparency for the listener, we re-recorded that in the end because we had a huge debate on what it meant to actually take something out of somebody's pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:05:11 - 02:05:20]** Yeah, so the lead up to that moment, the whole lead up, much like some other things that happened in the end, was not planned.

**[02:05:21 - 02:05:31]** What was planned, me not knowing what was going to happen, Kelly and I saying, is something going to happen now because everybody knows about the puck?

**[02:05:31 - 02:05:36]** And we talked about so many opportunities, all these possibilities.

**[02:05:36 - 02:05:37]** Are we prepared for PVP?

**[02:05:38 - 02:05:39]** What do we think is going to happen?

**[02:05:40 - 02:05:43]** And then Kelly just jumped in saying, I'm going to seize this moment.

**[02:05:44 - 02:05:46]** And then we start the next episode, this line in the sand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:05:46 - 02:05:49]** And I think we didn't really talk about it too much, but

**[02:05:49 - 02:06:15]** uh kelly had secretly been telling me he wants to fight rolu he told me that he wants he wants a battle with rolu he wants thaddeus and rolo to fight and i was like yes let's do this and i told kelly i was like even in that episode i was messaging him i was like if you're gonna attack him attack him now if you're gonna attack him attack him now attack him now this is the time to attack him i'm like messaging him this and he doesn't attack him and i was just like son of a bitch like he's just like messaging me he's like you know angry like i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:06:15 - 02:06:32]** frustrated things but like it just didn't seem appropriate in that moment because you know he was frozen I could take it peacefully Thaddeus could take it peacefully and Thaddeus as much as like he does rage out every now and again you have to remember that some of his inspiration is Shere Khan Shere Khan is cunning and

**[02:06:32 - 02:06:34]** It's only in those moments where he really loses it.

**[02:06:34 - 02:06:35]** He's also calculating.

**[02:06:35 - 02:06:38]** He's calculating this thing.

**[02:06:38 - 02:06:42]** It's not wise to kill Rolly without necessity.

**[02:06:44 - 02:06:45]** Far more valuable as a prisoner.

**[02:06:46 - 02:06:48]** Getting information on hears.

**[02:06:48 - 02:06:50]** Tactics.

**[02:06:50 - 02:06:51]** Yeah, tactical retreats.

**[02:06:51 - 02:06:52]** Yeah, tactics, Kevin.

**[02:06:52 - 02:06:54]** One day you'll see what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:06:55 - 02:07:06]** So that interaction with you guys all, I love that scene, but at the same time I was biting my own fingernails trying to figure out, I had an idea for what was supposed to happen and you were not doing that at all.

**[02:07:08 - 02:07:08]** It's so frustrating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:07:09 - 02:07:11]** So then we were like, well, maybe we'll fight later.

**[02:07:11 - 02:07:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:07:13 - 02:07:18]** Well, and this is also an interesting turning point in the book because in the book it says the true warriors attack.

**[02:07:18 - 02:07:24]** And you have this moment that the whole scrap points thing exists in the book.

**[02:07:24 - 02:07:33]** I think I developed it a little bit more and tried to shift it some to get you – because my goal was to draw you guys out of the lab and spread you out into –

**[02:07:33 - 02:08:02]** the stellar flare for the combat but in the book it's written basically you guys have scrap points and you can you each roll a check to get so many scrap points and you can set so many traps and so many traps then basically take off just kill each one as I come in I remember that and your question was like how much junk did you collect and we were all like none and I remember distinctly throughout the game going like this is scrap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:08:02 - 02:08:09]** And you guys are like, okay.

**[02:08:09 - 02:08:15]** When there's a new mechanic to a game that already has so many rules, I think you have to be upfront about it.

**[02:08:15 - 02:08:16]** And that's not on you.

**[02:08:16 - 02:08:21]** That's just like, that doesn't happen often in adventures where they're like, hey, this is going to matter.

**[02:08:22 - 02:08:24]** And I'm not going to tell you how until later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:08:24 - 02:08:25]** I don't think that's a part of the book even.

**[02:08:25 - 02:08:28]** I feel like there's two different types of players.

**[02:08:28 - 02:08:32]** There's one type of player that will collect literally everything you can pick up.

**[02:08:32 - 02:08:37]** And the other type that's like, okay, I have a limited amount of inventory and I only want to pick up

**[02:08:37 - 02:08:38]** Only the important things.

**[02:08:38 - 02:08:39]** Exactly.

**[02:08:39 - 02:08:41]** All four of us ended up the latter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:08:42 - 02:08:43]** Yeah.

**[02:08:43 - 02:08:56]** And I think the book doesn't actually have you collect them throughout the game because the scrap in this game, they introduced the Junkmancer, which is an amazing archetype, which apparently, I learned this, thank you, Adam, that anybody can take an archetype, not just Technomancers.

**[02:08:57 - 02:08:59]** So anybody can be a Junkermancer archetype.

**[02:09:00 - 02:09:01]** But...

**[02:09:01 - 02:09:10]** so the, the, the, the junk you find throughout the game is actually supposed to be used for those spells where the junk in the scrap point system is only from the roles.

**[02:09:10 - 02:09:12]** But I wanted to, I wanted to mix it up a little bit.

**[02:09:12 - 02:09:14]** And like, I wanted to fuck with you guys.

**[02:09:14 - 02:09:15]** Cause I know you didn't collect anything.

**[02:09:16 - 02:09:45]** so so then I also in the game you basically just like eliminate like there's four Yusokis you only you only fight three based off the number of traps you have like a trap kills everybody essentially like one trap kills one person and then they all attack you within the lab you're in the lab and you're attacked constantly and I was like no I want them to I want to draw them out I want to give you the full battlefield to play with and that worked I think you guys came out I had the Yusokis all come in way better um

**[02:09:45 - 02:09:46]** Thanks.

**[02:09:47 - 02:09:52]** I think it was fun for you guys to try to figure out which way they were going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:09:52 - 02:09:54]** How to follow them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:09:54 - 02:09:55]** The hobo load.

**[02:09:56 - 02:09:57]** I loved the hobo load.

**[02:09:57 - 02:09:58]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:09:58 - 02:10:01]** It was the difference between checkers and chess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:10:01 - 02:10:02]** Yep, exactly.

**[02:10:02 - 02:10:07]** And then Doutreleu comes, and Doutreleu and Tez come in, and that fight was f***ing phenomenal.

**[02:10:07 - 02:10:09]** It was so much fun.

**[02:10:09 - 02:10:10]** Again, thank you, Jason.

**[02:10:10 - 02:10:11]** Thank you, Jason.

**[02:10:11 - 02:10:12]** Yeah, incredible.

**[02:10:12 - 02:10:13]** He made that fight amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:10:13 - 02:10:23]** I'm actually curious his reaction to your transition from drawing us out and making us fight in the battlefield to taking the fight into the Stellar Flare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:10:24 - 02:10:27]** I forget exactly what I warned him with going into the match.

**[02:10:28 - 02:10:30]** I tried to give him just enough to play as Dotrulu.

**[02:10:30 - 02:10:32]** So I didn't give him a whole lot of back feed.

**[02:10:32 - 02:10:34]** I didn't tell him our entire story.

**[02:10:35 - 02:10:36]** I was just like, they're pirates.

**[02:10:37 - 02:10:38]** They're here to kill you.

**[02:10:40 - 02:10:43]** And so I think he didn't really have much of a perspective on that.

**[02:10:44 - 02:10:51]** I can't speak for Jason, but I don't think he thought otherwise about the map usage, if that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:10:52 - 02:10:53]** He just rolled in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:10:54 - 02:11:04]** He just rolled in, but then the imagery of this giant, giant character just moving through the halls, ducking down a bit.

**[02:11:04 - 02:11:04]** Destroying things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:11:04 - 02:11:05]** Smashing things on his way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:11:06 - 02:11:07]** Stepping on people's heads.

**[02:11:07 - 02:11:09]** It was phenomenal.


## Speaker_0

**[02:11:09 - 02:11:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:11:09 - 02:11:12]** His whole proposition was really creative, too.

**[02:11:13 - 02:11:17]** He says, like, look, just get one of you up against me, and that's it.

**[02:11:17 - 02:11:18]** They take the whole thing and whatever.

**[02:11:18 - 02:11:23]** And then Termay, ballsy as he was, was like, I'll do it, guys.

**[02:11:23 - 02:11:24]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:11:24 - 02:11:26]** I think I told Vinny about that, but, like...

**[02:11:26 - 02:11:29]** Jason messaged me privately, like, can I try something?

**[02:11:29 - 02:11:31]** And I was like, yeah, f*** yeah, man.

**[02:11:31 - 02:11:32]** I trust you fully with this.

**[02:11:32 - 02:11:33]** Do whatever you want to do.

**[02:11:33 - 02:11:36]** And that's when he pulled it out and was like, let's do the duel.

**[02:11:36 - 02:11:38]** Which one do you want to fight me?

**[02:11:38 - 02:11:39]** And I was like, oh my god, this is so great.

**[02:11:40 - 02:11:42]** And him and I were messaging privately.

**[02:11:42 - 02:11:44]** I was like, I still have the two Yusokis.

**[02:11:44 - 02:11:44]** When do you want me to attack?

**[02:11:44 - 02:11:46]** When do you want me to attack?

**[02:11:46 - 02:11:48]** We were like messaging privately that entire match.

**[02:11:48 - 02:11:50]** I had so much fun during those episodes.

**[02:11:50 - 02:11:50]** It was so good.

**[02:11:51 - 02:11:54]** Honestly, these last three episodes were so awesome.

**[02:11:54 - 02:11:55]** I had so much fun.

**[02:11:55 - 02:11:59]** It made this entire, like this campaign so much fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:11:59 - 02:12:00]** Absolutely agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:12:00 - 02:12:03]** And then, then VARI 13 was dragged out.

**[02:12:03 - 02:12:04]** Cause I was like, what am I going to?

**[02:12:04 - 02:12:07]** So again, VARI 13 is in the book.

**[02:12:07 - 02:12:08]** I don't know if I mentioned it to you guys.

**[02:12:08 - 02:12:12]** I told John offline in the book, VARI 13 is still at Junkers Delight.

**[02:12:13 - 02:12:14]** This entire book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:12:14 - 02:12:14]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:12:15 - 02:12:16]** They are never in the field with you.

**[02:12:17 - 02:12:21]** And so at the end of the game, you go back to Junkers of Light and you're like, hey, this is what we found.

**[02:12:22 - 02:12:24]** But I was like, no, I want Vahri to be there.

**[02:12:24 - 02:12:25]** I want Vahri.

**[02:12:25 - 02:12:30]** And I put Vahri outside so I can have that final vision when the true warriors showed up.

**[02:12:30 - 02:12:32]** And I wanted you to know the true warriors are outside.

**[02:12:33 - 02:12:34]** Makes sense.

**[02:12:34 - 02:12:36]** In the book, it says that Riddle actually messages you.

**[02:12:37 - 02:12:38]** You call Riddle and say, hey, we found stuff.

**[02:12:39 - 02:12:41]** And then Riddle goes, hey, but the true warriors are coming.

**[02:12:41 - 02:12:43]** You got some time, but you should probably stay still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:12:44 - 02:12:47]** Paizo, I just want to put this out there real quick.

**[02:12:47 - 02:12:53]** If you need another writer, there's a guy called Kevin Decker, and I feel like you should reach out to him.

**[02:12:54 - 02:12:55]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:12:56 - 02:12:58]** How did we land on Home Alone?

**[02:12:59 - 02:13:00]** We were just talking about setting traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:13:00 - 02:13:06]** We were talking about setting traps inside of our house, defending our castle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:13:06 - 02:13:08]** Yeah, it was excellent.

**[02:13:08 - 02:13:12]** That was just like one of those spur of the moment, like, yeah,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:13:12 - 02:13:41]** so what it was was I had written the scene where the comms come in and Tez Tronin takes over the comms and tells you like hey we're coming in I wrote that scene to interrupt the fight between Rolu and Thaddeus so that Rolu didn't die but the fight never happened that would have fucked up the whole timeline please don't let Rolu die as we're planning all these things I'll just say from the beginning


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:13:42 - 02:13:45]** Like, you, Kev, would be like, well, you know, like, Rolo can't do this.

**[02:13:45 - 02:13:47]** And I would just always say.

**[02:13:47 - 02:13:48]** You had a plan.

**[02:13:48 - 02:13:51]** Yeah, he probably has something up his sleeve.

**[02:13:51 - 02:13:53]** Yeah, like, if he dies, he dies.

**[02:13:53 - 02:13:54]** If it happens, it happens.

**[02:13:54 - 02:13:55]** I kept hearing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:13:55 - 02:13:58]** And the Joturu fight being what it was, f***ing phenomenal.

**[02:13:58 - 02:14:01]** It ended out, it ended so cinematically.

**[02:14:01 - 02:14:11]** It left with, it left with Treme dead or dying and then Chak on Rolu's shoulder and Thaddeus there.

**[02:14:11 - 02:14:15]** And John and I had so many conversations about this scene.

**[02:14:15 - 02:14:18]** And I kept telling John like, oh, you, he has the secret seal.

**[02:14:18 - 02:14:28]** Gym that I gave him so he can just lock you guys in the room Yeah, seal you could lock himself in the room with you because he also has the portal so he can use the portal Thing and then I was like, oh what if you lock the seal door?

**[02:14:28 - 02:14:34]** I was doing all this research about how how easy it is to break down through turns out It's fucking impossible.

**[02:14:34 - 02:14:38]** If you would have locked that door you guys would have been stuck in there for a century Oh

**[02:14:38 - 02:14:41]** Because the hardness is 20 and none of you guys hit harder than 20.

**[02:14:41 - 02:14:43]** And so you guys never hit any damage on it.

**[02:14:43 - 02:14:46]** And you didn't have a high enough engineering check to get out of there.

**[02:14:46 - 02:14:49]** So I was trying to figure out ways to get you out of there, which you never ended up using.

**[02:14:49 - 02:14:51]** And I took into account, oh, what about acid damage?

**[02:14:51 - 02:14:53]** Apparently acid damage in Starfinder doesn't do anything to a door.

**[02:14:53 - 02:14:55]** I was like, ah, losing my mind.

**[02:14:55 - 02:14:58]** And then that doesn't even f***ing happen because the three of you turned on him.


## Speaker_0

**[02:14:59 - 02:14:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:14:59 - 02:15:08]** Which, yeah, I have to say credit to Vinny and to Kev real quick, because up until then, I was like, all right, Rolu needs to get the stone.

**[02:15:08 - 02:15:10]** Chalk has it in his pants.

**[02:15:10 - 02:15:11]** I need to get it.

**[02:15:12 - 02:15:17]** I'm going to start making and negotiating because I'm like, do I want to fight as a player?

**[02:15:17 - 02:15:20]** I don't know if we're like if we really want to go to it, like we're OK with it.

**[02:15:20 - 02:15:27]** but do I want to do that because then I have to fight Testronin and then I lock you in there and then it's just me and can I actually live because I have one resolve point?

**[02:15:27 - 02:15:32]** And then credit to Vinny and Kev who were like, okay, but also what does Chak want?

**[02:15:32 - 02:15:33]** And I was like, you're right.

**[02:15:33 - 02:15:36]** It makes sense that Rolu, if Rolu is going to move...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:15:37 - 02:15:38]** That's just Vinny.

**[02:15:38 - 02:15:44]** Because all I ever said, I kept telling John over and over again, is your objective is to get out alive with the puck.

**[02:15:44 - 02:15:45]** Whatever you have to do.

**[02:15:45 - 02:15:47]** And I was like, just fucking kill Vinny.

**[02:15:47 - 02:15:48]** Like, kill Chuck.

**[02:15:49 - 02:15:50]** Knock him out.

**[02:15:50 - 02:15:51]** Knock him out.

**[02:15:51 - 02:15:52]** Take.

**[02:15:52 - 02:15:53]** Take the puck and run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:15:53 - 02:15:53]** That's all you got to do.

**[02:15:54 - 02:15:55]** And that's why I didn't lock the door.

**[02:15:55 - 02:15:59]** Cause I was like, all right, if this is going to be just Rolu, he's not a good person.

**[02:15:59 - 02:16:05]** If he'd like the only other, like, like crew that he feels like he is like working with as like part of his family that he cares about.

**[02:16:05 - 02:16:07]** He's not a cob, just in name only.

**[02:16:07 - 02:16:08]** He like actually cares about the crew.

**[02:16:08 - 02:16:11]** And suddenly out of nowhere, he's going to be like, hey, yo, I want that stone.

**[02:16:11 - 02:16:14]** Boom, punch you in the face and leave and then like lock you in there.

**[02:16:14 - 02:16:15]** No, he's not going to do that.

**[02:16:15 - 02:16:16]** So then I'm like, all right, great.

**[02:16:17 - 02:16:18]** I need to get shock on my side.

**[02:16:18 - 02:16:22]** Then once you were on my side, I asked you, I said, what do we do about them?

**[02:16:22 - 02:16:23]** I don't think they're going to follow us.

**[02:16:23 - 02:16:26]** And you said you were like, what do you mean?

**[02:16:26 - 02:16:28]** Like, I think it's fine.

**[02:16:28 - 02:16:30]** And that told me, all right.

**[02:16:30 - 02:16:33]** If I lock them in there right now, Shock's not going to be on my side.

**[02:16:33 - 02:16:36]** And then I'm going to have to fight Shock, and that's not going to work.

**[02:16:36 - 02:16:40]** So maybe we need to actually try and get Torme on our side.

**[02:16:41 - 02:16:42]** So that's why I didn't lock you in.

**[02:16:43 - 02:16:45]** And it worked out so beautifully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:16:46 - 02:16:48]** That was exactly our conversation.

**[02:16:48 - 02:16:53]** So to pull the curtain back even further, John and I had a conversation this morning about this exact moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:16:54 - 02:16:55]** We didn't script it.

**[02:16:55 - 02:16:56]** I just asked you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:16:56 - 02:16:59]** And we very explicitly didn't script it.

**[02:17:00 - 02:17:05]** And one of your questions was, hey, do you want to talk about what I'm actually going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:17:06 - 02:17:07]** Which was lock everyone in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:17:07 - 02:17:07]** Right.

**[02:17:07 - 02:17:10]** My response was no, because I want to react in real time.

**[02:17:12 - 02:17:17]** But the lasting question was, what does Rolu want?

**[02:17:18 - 02:17:19]** Does Rolu want the stone?

**[02:17:19 - 02:17:22]** Or does Rolu want Chak on his side?

**[02:17:22 - 02:17:24]** Does Rolu want the stone?

**[02:17:24 - 02:17:27]** Or does Rolu want the rest of the crew on his side?

**[02:17:28 - 02:17:35]** Because this is not just... And we'll probably get to this in maybe five minutes.

**[02:17:37 - 02:17:40]** Rolu getting the stone isn't just Rolu getting the stone.

**[02:17:40 - 02:17:52]** Rolu has a whole path to tread down after getting the stone from Chak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:17:52 - 02:18:01]** The crazy thing, though, is story arc-wise, from the very beginning of writing this story, it was, hey, this is a story of how Rolu got the stone and gave it to Hears.

**[02:18:02 - 02:18:03]** That is the story.

**[02:18:03 - 02:18:04]** That's all the story is.

**[02:18:05 - 02:18:06]** Spoiler alert.

**[02:18:06 - 02:18:06]** Right.

**[02:18:06 - 02:18:17]** But you guys put so much more life into this, and you and Tremé are such—Chalk and Tremé were such wild cards in the scene that I had no idea where it was going to go.

**[02:18:17 - 02:18:23]** And I'm literally messaging John and Kelly because I had—and I've been on these—

**[02:18:23 - 02:18:29]** Just for the listener, I've been on these four for at least a month about this epilogue and how we were going to do it.

**[02:18:30 - 02:18:31]** And I was like, I want you guys to have scripts.

**[02:18:31 - 02:18:32]** I want to know what you're going to say.

**[02:18:32 - 02:18:33]** I just want to know everything.

**[02:18:34 - 02:18:41]** And even the stuff that we finally got on paper, well, digital, WordDocs, was all thrown out the f***ing window the moment we got to this scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:18:42 - 02:18:51]** To be fair, before we started this episode, I turned to you, Kevin, and said, hey, by the way, I'm pretty sure we're going to have to throw all of this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:18:51 - 02:18:54]** quickly became apparent that that was the case today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:18:56 - 02:18:59]** To Will and Kelly, thank you so much.

**[02:19:00 - 02:19:02]** And your work was phenomenal.

**[02:19:03 - 02:19:06]** Having to juggle two different characters in one scene is f***ing hard.

**[02:19:07 - 02:19:08]** And you guys did so well.

**[02:19:08 - 02:19:13]** And Will, your scene was completely blown apart when Chuck was like, no, I'm not going back to the ship.

**[02:19:14 - 02:19:17]** Improv.

**[02:19:17 - 02:19:19]** We actually had to pause.

**[02:19:19 - 02:19:21]** You were like, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:19:23 - 02:19:26]** You took a minute, you thought about it, you figured it out, and you roll with it.

**[02:19:26 - 02:19:33]** Everything that you hear, once we leave the Stellar Flare, just for the listener, that's all one take.

**[02:19:34 - 02:19:35]** That's a continuous take.

**[02:19:35 - 02:19:41]** There's a very slight, oh, let me just pause for a small break, whatever.

**[02:19:42 - 02:19:42]** But it's all one take.

**[02:19:43 - 02:19:44]** We didn't talk about it.

**[02:19:44 - 02:19:45]** We had a bunch of other ideas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:19:46 - 02:19:48]** And it's like 80% unscripted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:19:48 - 02:19:56]** Yeah, so Kev gave us sort of an outline of what he thought that would happen in our sort of end.

**[02:19:56 - 02:20:00]** And in that one minute, I basically scanned through it.

**[02:20:00 - 02:20:03]** I was like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

**[02:20:03 - 02:20:04]** All right, let's do it.

**[02:20:04 - 02:20:06]** Let's pick it up.

**[02:20:06 - 02:20:07]** 13 episodes.

**[02:20:07 - 02:20:08]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:20:09 - 02:20:10]** It was amazing.

**[02:20:10 - 02:20:15]** And the comment that I made after the episode still stands today.

**[02:20:15 - 02:20:19]** I am so thankful for this collection of individuals.

**[02:20:19 - 02:20:20]** Totally agree.

**[02:20:21 - 02:20:23]** To go down this adventure on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:20:24 - 02:20:36]** Because the ending, the moments, the goodbyes, the tension, the uncertainty, and then it just came together in a way that it could only could with us.

**[02:20:36 - 02:20:38]** Just beautiful people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:20:38 - 02:20:39]** Beautiful minds.

**[02:20:39 - 02:20:40]** I was...

**[02:20:40 - 02:20:46]** I was actually really nervous because I was like, man, those last two episodes with Otrulu were so intense.

**[02:20:46 - 02:20:47]** There was so much character.

**[02:20:47 - 02:20:50]** There was so much just like energy.

**[02:20:50 - 02:20:51]** How are we going to keep that up?

**[02:20:52 - 02:20:54]** And you guys, you guys f***ing delivered.

**[02:20:54 - 02:20:56]** It was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:20:56 - 02:21:04]** One of the things that we talked about very early on when I first joined the cast was how we tend to lean toward...

**[02:21:04 - 02:21:24]** humor because that's what we're all good at and so I want to take a since I think we're doing this now I want to take a particular moment to thank Kelly for like going with me on that really dramatic like goodbye which for the listener I missed that because I went to pee laughing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:21:24 - 02:21:50]** you can listen to it yeah thanks kelly yeah oh uh i was just gonna say following up with vinny like that was that as kelly the way that i it was so hard for me to say no to vinny to say no to shock i was so tempted to just be like yeah it would be fun to go on an adventure and do something new and like whatever but but that it couldn't do it that is there's just no way to do it uh

**[02:21:50 - 02:22:15]** and also knowing now that thaddeus had this ulterior mission sort of since from the very beginning i was like thaddeus was put here by one of the high pirate council members the commodore and uh he um who is also the narrator of the beginning who he found out of at the very end beautiful ending of our uh of our beautifully played episodes you hear um

**[02:22:15 - 02:22:17]** you know, unknown treasures, that whole thing.

**[02:22:17 - 02:22:18]** That's him.

**[02:22:18 - 02:22:25]** But like, yeah, that's, that's the guy whose ship was attacked by was ship was like invaded by here's and, and the crew and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:22:25 - 02:22:29]** So, well, and, and John didn't know still, John doesn't know this.

**[02:22:29 - 02:22:33]** He just learned this today that the, this is a character in his campaign.

**[02:22:33 - 02:22:36]** So dropping bombs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:22:36 - 02:22:36]** Great.

**[02:22:37 - 02:22:38]** Big thumbs up.

**[02:22:38 - 02:22:39]** But yeah.

**[02:22:39 - 02:22:41]** Will, you had said that you wanted to talk about the end.

**[02:22:41 - 02:22:44]** Did you just mean you just wanted to talk about what we're talking about now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:22:45 - 02:22:45]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:22:45 - 02:22:46]** Or was there something else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:22:46 - 02:22:54]** The whole, I mean, do we want to say the thing that was on me and Vinny's mind as we did Roller's epilogue?

**[02:22:54 - 02:22:55]** That's what I want to know.

**[02:22:55 - 02:22:55]** Sure.

**[02:22:55 - 02:22:56]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:22:56 - 02:22:58]** So let's get to it.

**[02:22:59 - 02:23:02]** Okay, so you guys left the Stellar Flare.

**[02:23:02 - 02:23:04]** We had the whole conversation with everybody outside.

**[02:23:05 - 02:23:06]** You guys walked all of them out.

**[02:23:08 - 02:23:16]** The biggest thing is, again, I scripted something with Kelly privately that I was like, man, when is this going to pop up?

**[02:23:16 - 02:23:22]** And it wasn't until after I got back from peeing and you guys were like, hey, we had this big heart-to-heart that...

**[02:23:22 - 02:23:24]** that we were like, oh, this is the opportunity.

**[02:23:24 - 02:23:30]** And then it was like, well, the whole scene at the bar with drawing the gun and like, holy shit.

**[02:23:30 - 02:23:32]** And the misfire and the spell jam.

**[02:23:32 - 02:23:33]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:23:33 - 02:23:34]** The diversion.

**[02:23:35 - 02:23:37]** Waiting, waiting for them to leave.

**[02:23:37 - 02:23:41]** Like this whole, like we're all just looking at each other knowing it's going to happen any second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:23:42 - 02:23:44]** And all completely unplanned.

**[02:23:44 - 02:23:49]** And as, as the GM that was trying to orchestrate all this, I was like, John, when are you going to do your scene?

**[02:23:49 - 02:23:50]** When are we doing your scene?

**[02:23:51 - 02:23:52]** Um, how are you going to get away?

**[02:23:52 - 02:23:54]** And then that happened and it was phenomenal.

**[02:23:54 - 02:23:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:23:55 - 02:23:58]** That was totally, that was totally improvised on everyone's part.

**[02:23:58 - 02:24:00]** Like it did not go at all how we planned.

**[02:24:00 - 02:24:02]** Not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:24:02 - 02:24:02]** Yeah.

**[02:24:02 - 02:24:10]** And then we cut to this beautiful thing with Thaddeus and the narrator that no one had any idea about, which was fucking incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:24:10 - 02:24:11]** It was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:24:11 - 02:24:17]** And then we cut to Rolu and Chak and Treme leaving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:24:17 - 02:24:22]** So Rolu's script was written just for Rolu.

**[02:24:22 - 02:24:24]** The idea was he was going to leave the ship.

**[02:24:24 - 02:24:29]** And the original plan for Rolu was he was just going to dart out of there during the Dotrulu fight.

**[02:24:29 - 02:24:32]** He was talking about abandoning you guys that far back.

**[02:24:32 - 02:24:35]** And I was like, I kept telling John, like, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:24:35 - 02:24:37]** But I was like, as a player, that doesn't feel right.

**[02:24:37 - 02:24:38]** No, Kev, you wanted me to do it.

**[02:24:38 - 02:24:39]** You were like, go, go, go.

**[02:24:40 - 02:24:43]** And I was like, I don't want to leave you in the middle of this BBG.

**[02:24:43 - 02:24:45]** Like, as a player, that's just not cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:24:45 - 02:24:48]** That's also a dereliction of your duty, right?

**[02:24:48 - 02:24:49]** Exactly, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:24:49 - 02:24:52]** Like, yeah, and, like, Rolu does care about his crew.

**[02:24:52 - 02:24:53]** Like, he doesn't want to do that.

**[02:24:54 - 02:24:55]** Eh, I guess so.

**[02:24:55 - 02:24:56]** Okay, cool, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:24:57 - 02:24:58]** I think I would.

**[02:24:58 - 02:24:58]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:24:58 - 02:25:03]** I don't want to gloss over this.

**[02:25:03 - 02:25:10]** This is Thaddeus and Kelly telling Rolu that he's not a total piece of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:25:10 - 02:25:16]** I know that you care about the crew of the Nave's Revenge, which is the ship with Sheeran and all that.

**[02:25:16 - 02:25:19]** And the Caduceus.

**[02:25:19 - 02:25:27]** This could be, unless because you plan things out way in advance, John, we're going to find out something later that I don't know about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:25:27 - 02:25:35]** The last line where I say sell, or one of the last lines, I say sell all my paintings.

**[02:25:35 - 02:25:36]** I have more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:25:37 - 02:25:40]** The way that it sounded

**[02:25:40 - 02:25:46]** Outside the ship with us in it conveniently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:25:46 - 02:25:47]** Yeah.

**[02:25:48 - 02:25:52]** So this is what's happening in the voice track.

**[02:25:52 - 02:25:57]** In the chat, Will and I are like, what the fuck is happening right now?

**[02:25:59 - 02:26:01]** Are we going to lose a kidney?

**[02:26:01 - 02:26:05]** Are we just being sold to whomever?

**[02:26:05 - 02:26:10]** Is this ship going to self-destruct?

**[02:26:10 - 02:26:12]** There is very little.

**[02:26:13 - 02:26:16]** Chuck believes Rolu is what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:26:16 - 02:26:17]** And now I feel duped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:26:17 - 02:26:19]** Chuck has rose-colored glasses.

**[02:26:19 - 02:26:21]** We're going to go save the universe.

**[02:26:21 - 02:26:26]** Vinny is like, oh no, I just got f***ed by John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:26:26 - 02:26:32]** I spent a lot of time in the past hour since that happened being like, what do I say?

**[02:26:32 - 02:26:34]** Do I comment on this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:26:35 - 02:26:37]** John even asked if he could re-record that.

**[02:26:37 - 02:26:38]** We were all like, nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:26:38 - 02:26:40]** I was like, I have this thought.

**[02:26:40 - 02:26:42]** Maybe this is a little better to say.

**[02:26:42 - 02:26:43]** And you know what?

**[02:26:43 - 02:26:46]** I'm going to put my game face on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:26:46 - 02:26:50]** As an observer, like, I was just, like, listening to, like, they're just pulling up.

**[02:26:50 - 02:26:53]** It's a very beautiful, like, you know, like, quiet-ish moment.

**[02:26:53 - 02:26:54]** Like, Rolly's, like, you know, meeting these new people.

**[02:26:55 - 02:26:57]** They're pulling into, the ship's pulling out.

**[02:26:57 - 02:27:01]** And then, like, and then I just see in the chat, bing, bing, bing, bing.

**[02:27:01 - 02:27:08]** It's just, like, Vinny and, like, Will being, like, why do I get the sense that I'm about to be Ben's bamboozled where I'm about to get f***ed?

**[02:27:08 - 02:27:08]** Oh, my God.

**[02:27:08 - 02:27:09]** We shouldn't have trusted him.

**[02:27:10 - 02:27:11]** Like, over and over and over.

**[02:27:11 - 02:27:14]** So they're just gone.

**[02:27:14 - 02:27:17]** And they're panicking, slowly dying inside.

**[02:27:18 - 02:27:20]** That would be hilarious.

**[02:27:20 - 02:27:21]** Thaddeus would have been right the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:27:21 - 02:27:23]** And the truth is, we don't know.

**[02:27:23 - 02:27:31]** All we know now is that you guys are on the ship with him after he made that comment, and then he ends up dead trying to give the stone to Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:27:31 - 02:27:33]** What happened in between, we don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:27:33 - 02:27:35]** Yeah, what happened to Shock and Tremaine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:27:35 - 02:27:36]** This is...

**[02:27:36 - 02:27:41]** This is the worst part for me as both a cast member and a player and an audience member.

**[02:27:41 - 02:27:42]** There are so many.

**[02:27:42 - 02:27:46]** And one of the things I look forward to this plot armor is we get all the questions answered.

**[02:27:46 - 02:27:48]** Everything's tied up with a neat little bow.

**[02:27:48 - 02:27:50]** And we still.

**[02:27:50 - 02:27:51]** Except that.

**[02:27:51 - 02:27:54]** Don't know if we can trust John.

**[02:27:55 - 02:27:58]** John is the outlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:27:59 - 02:28:02]** I'm deep in that three-fold conspiracy, bro.

**[02:28:02 - 02:28:04]** I am living that life.

**[02:28:04 - 02:28:05]** Three-fold conspiracy breaks the fourth wall.

**[02:28:05 - 02:28:06]** I am about that life right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:28:07 - 02:28:07]** Yeah, I know.

**[02:28:07 - 02:28:12]** It's throughout the entire extended universe of Will Save Now.

**[02:28:12 - 02:28:13]** My God.

**[02:28:13 - 02:28:13]** Right.

**[02:28:13 - 02:28:14]** Yeah, yeah.

**[02:28:14 - 02:28:16]** And that final message that he records.

**[02:28:18 - 02:28:19]** Yeah.

**[02:28:19 - 02:28:23]** Is that word for word what's in the three-fold conspiracy, right?

**[02:28:24 - 02:28:25]** like the message that's left for years.

**[02:28:25 - 02:28:26]** I'm trying to remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:28:26 - 02:28:27]** Why is John smiling?

**[02:28:27 - 02:28:28]** He's eating grin right now.

**[02:28:28 - 02:28:30]** Son of a bitch.

**[02:28:30 - 02:28:32]** I can't recall what his sound effect is.

**[02:28:34 - 02:28:48]** So when I first started talking to John about this whole game, my thing was we ended the last episode of book two with the message from Rolu, I believe, right?

**[02:28:49 - 02:28:53]** And then we lead into it with a message from Hears to Rolu.

**[02:28:53 - 02:28:57]** And so I wanted to end this game with a message from Rolu back to Hears.

**[02:28:57 - 02:28:59]** And it was the message that he sent him.

**[02:29:00 - 02:29:02]** But now I'm questioning everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:29:03 - 02:29:08]** I've always questioned Jon from the very beginning since he was GMing threefold because you never know what he's up to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:29:09 - 02:29:09]** Yeah, never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:29:10 - 02:29:12]** You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:29:12 - 02:29:14]** Well, that is all of Junker's Delight for you.

**[02:29:14 - 02:29:19]** I'm sorry it took a whole 40 episodes longer than it should have.

**[02:29:19 - 02:29:21]** Thank you so much for listening.

**[02:29:21 - 02:29:22]** Thank you to the four of you guys for playing.

**[02:29:22 - 02:29:29]** Seriously, I know I whined and moaned so much, but I don't hate GMing nearly as much as I say I do.

**[02:29:29 - 02:29:36]** It is overwhelming, but I might try again in 10 years when my kids are old enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:29:36 - 02:29:41]** You need to go on a long vacation from jamming until you get that itch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:29:43 - 02:29:44]** Until you get the itch.

**[02:29:44 - 02:29:45]** Yeah, you're a fantastic actor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:29:45 - 02:29:49]** But I am super excited to hop back into the role of Rick 19.

**[02:29:49 - 02:29:51]** Oh, I can't wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:29:51 - 02:29:54]** Yes, I can't wait to see what Dr. O.K.

**[02:29:54 - 02:29:55]** is into next.

**[02:29:55 - 02:29:56]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:29:56 - 02:29:59]** I've forgotten how to do a Scottish accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:30:00 - 02:30:01]** Irish accent.

**[02:30:02 - 02:30:03]** You got a week to figure it out.

**[02:30:04 - 02:30:05]** Thank you to our listeners.

**[02:30:06 - 02:30:10]** Thank you to Jason Keeley for joining us, for writing this, for just supporting it.

**[02:30:11 - 02:30:12]** Thank you to all of our fans.

**[02:30:12 - 02:30:13]** Thank you to the paralegals.

**[02:30:13 - 02:30:15]** Thank you to Adam and Jeremy.

**[02:30:16 - 02:30:18]** Thank you to everyone.

**[02:30:18 - 02:30:20]** Thanks, Leslie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:30:20 - 02:30:22]** Thanks, Taco Monk.

**[02:30:23 - 02:30:23]** I don't know.

**[02:30:23 - 02:30:25]** You guys know who you are on Discord.

**[02:30:25 - 02:30:26]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:30:27 - 02:30:28]** You all are fantastic.

**[02:30:28 - 02:30:31]** Stay tuned for the next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[02:30:31 - 02:30:32]** For more.

**[02:30:33 - 02:30:37]** For John's bulls**t. John's bulls**t. And who knows?

**[02:30:37 - 02:30:39]** Maybe there will be something to see pretty soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:30:39 - 02:30:41]** See you next time, Scallywags.

**[02:30:41 - 02:30:42]** Something to see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:30:42 - 02:30:45]** Next time on Big Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[02:30:46 - 02:30:47]** Drift beacons and distant stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:30:47 - 02:30:49]** Drift beacons and distant stars, y'all.

**[02:30:49 - 02:30:50]** Distant stars.
